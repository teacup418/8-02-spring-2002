1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,234



2
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:14,63
When positive charges move in
unintelligible directions,

3
00:00:14,63 --> 00:00:27,98
then per definition,
we say the current goes in this

4
00:00:27,98 --> 00:00:33,895
direction.
When negative charges go in

5
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:37,283
this direction,
we also say the current goes in

6
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:40,377
that direction,
that's just our convention.

7
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:44,06
If I apply a potential
difference over a conductor,

8
00:00:44,06 --> 00:00:47,669
then I'm going to create an
electric field in that

9
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:50,615
conductor.
And the electrons -- there are

10
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:54,003
free electrons in a conductor --
they can move,

11
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:57,907
but the ions cannot move,
because they are frozen into

12
00:00:57,907 --> 00:01:03,195
the solid, into the crystal.
And so when a current flows in

13
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:07,152
a conductor, it's always the
electrons that are responsible

14
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:10,36
for the current.
The electrons fuel the electric

15
00:01:10,36 --> 00:01:14,454
fields, and then the electrons
try to make the electric field

16
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:18,412
zero, but they can't succeed,
because we keep the potential

17
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,096
difference over the conductor.
Often, there is a linear

18
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:25,235
relationship between current and
the potential,

19
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,828
in which case,
we talk about Ohm's Law.

20
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:31,308
Now, I will try to derive Ohm's
Law

21
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:34,507
in a very crude way,
a poor man's version,

22
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:37,705
and not really one hundred
percent kosher,

23
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:42,307
it requires quantum mechanics,
which is beyond the course --

24
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:46,987
beyond this course -- but I will
do a job that still gives us

25
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:50,029
some interesting insight into
Ohm's Law.

26
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:53,539
If I start off with a
conductor, for instance,

27
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:57,985
copper, at room temperature,
three hundred degrees Kelvin,

28
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,183
the free electrons in copper
have a speed,

29
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:06,903
an average speed of about a
million meters per second.

30
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:11,477
So this is the average speed of
those free electrons,

31
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:14,38
about a million meters per
second.

32
00:02:14,38 --> 00:02:18,338
This in all directions.
It's a chaotic motion.

33
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,737
It's a thermal motion,
it's due to the temperature.

34
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:28,102
The time between collisions --
time  between the collisions --

35
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:33,468
and this is a collision of the
free electron with the atoms --

36
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:38,483
is approximately -- I call it
tau --

37
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:43,885
is about three times ten to the
minus fourteen seconds.

38
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:48,188
No surprise,
because the speed is enormously

39
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:50,889
high.
And the number of free

40
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:56,592
electrons in copper per cubic
meter, I call that number N,

41
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:59,694
is about ten to the
twenty-nine.

42
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:04,296
There's about one free electron
for every atom.

43
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:10,205
So we get twen- ten to the
twenty-nine free electrons per

44
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,947
cubic meter.
So now imagine that I apply a

45
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:16,759
potential difference  piece of
copper -- or any conductor,

46
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,37
for that matter -- then the
electrons will experience a

47
00:03:20,37 --> 00:03:24,383
force which is the charge of the
electron, that's my little E

48
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:27,191
times the electric field that
I'm creating,

49
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,733
because I apply a potential
difference.

50
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:33,277
I realize that the force and
the electric field are in

51
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:36,888
opposite directions for
electrons, but that's a detail,

52
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:41,373
I'm interested
in the magnitudes only.

53
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:46,104
And so now these electrons will
experience an acceleration,

54
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:50,509
which is the force divided by
the mass of the electron,

55
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:55,078
and so they will pick up,
eh, speed, between these colli-

56
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:58,667
collisions, which we call the
drift velocity,

57
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:02,256
which is A times tau,
it's just eight oh one.

58
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:06,09
And so A equals F divided by M.
E F is in the A,

59
00:04:06,09 --> 00:04:10,659
so we get E times E divided by
the mass of the electrons,

60
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:14,738
times tau.
And that is the

61
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:18,9
the drift velocity.
When the electric field goes

62
00:04:18,9 --> 00:04:24,391
up, the drift velocity goes up,
so the electrons move faster in

63
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:27,667
the direction opposite to the
current.

64
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:32,45
If the time between collisions
gets larger, they -- the

65
00:04:32,45 --> 00:04:37,409
acceleration lasts longer,
so also, they pick up a larger

66
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:40,686
speed, so that's intuitively
pleasing.

67
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:45,291
If we take a specific case,
and I take, for instance,

68
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:50,084
copper,
and I apply over the -- over a

69
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:56,153
wire -- let's say the wire has a
length of 10 meters -- I apply a

70
00:04:56,153 --> 00:05:01,558
potential difference I call
delta V, but I could have said

71
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:06,489
just V -- I apply there a
potential difference of ten

72
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:11,61
volts, then the electric field
-- inside the conductor,

73
00:05:11,61 --> 00:05:14,834
now -- is about one volt per
meter.

74
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:20,155
And so I can calculate,
now, for that specific case,

75
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:23,587
I can calculate what the drift
velocity would be.

76
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:27,663
So the drift velocity of those
free electrons would be the

77
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:31,31
charge of the electron,
which is one point six times

78
00:05:31,31 --> 00:05:33,742
ten to the minus nineteen
Coulombs.

79
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:37,031
The E field is one,
so I can forget about that.

80
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:40,178
Tau is three times ten to the
minus fourteen,

81
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:43,825
as long as I'm room
temperature, and the mass of the

82
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:48,687
electron is about ten to the
minus thirty kilograms.

83
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:53,595
And so, if I didn't slip up,
I found that this is five times

84
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:58,253
ten to the minus three meters
per second, which is half a

85
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:02,578
centimeter per second.
So imagine, due to the thermal

86
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:07,402
motion, these free electrons
move with a million meters per

87
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:10,562
second.
But due to this electric field,

88
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:14,97
they only advance along the
wire slowly, like a snail,

89
00:06:14,97 --> 00:06:20,709
with a speed on average of half
a centimeter per second.

90
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,002
And that goes very much against
your and my own intuition,

91
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:28,843
but this is the way it is.
I mean, a turtle would go

92
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:33,061
faster than these electrons.
To go along a ten-meter wire

93
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:36,45
would take half hour.
Something that you never

94
00:06:36,45 --> 00:06:39,538
thought of.
That it would take a half hour

95
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:44,207
for these electrons to go along
the wire if you apply potential

96
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:47,747
difference of ten volts,
copper ten meters long.

97
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:51,588
Now, I want to massage this
further,

98
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:58
and see whether we can somehow
squeeze out Ohm's Law,

99
00:06:58 --> 00:07:05,03
which is the linear relation
between the potential and the

100
00:07:05,03 --> 00:07:09,84
current.
So let me start off with a wire

101
00:07:09,84 --> 00:07:16,006
which has a cross-section A,
and it has a length L,

102
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:21,062
and I put a potential
difference

103
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:24,687
over the wire,
plus here, and minus there,

104
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:28,134
potential V,
so I would get a current in

105
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:31,581
this direction,
that's our definition of

106
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,498
current, going from plus to
minus.

107
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:38,299
The electrons,
of course, are moving in this

108
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,305
direction, with the drift
velocity.

109
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:45,724
And so the electric field in
here, which is in this

110
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:51,205
direction, that electric field
is approximately V divided by L,

111
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:56,331
potential difference divided by
distance.

112
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:00,84
In one second,
these free electrons will move

113
00:08:00,84 --> 00:08:05,451
from left to right over a
distance V D meters.

114
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:10,369
So if I make any cross-section
through this wire,

115
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:16,619
anywhere, I can calculate how
many electrons pass through that

116
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:20,923
cross-section in one second.
In one second,

117
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:29,223
the volume that passes through
here, the volume is V D times A

118
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:33,581
but the number of free
electrons per cubic meter is

119
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:38,55
called N, so this is now the
number of free electrons that

120
00:08:38,55 --> 00:08:42,473
passes, per second,
through any cross-section.

121
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:47,617
And each electron has a charge
E, and so this is the current

122
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:49,971
that will flow.
The current,

123
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:54,504
of course, is in this
direction, but that's a detail.

124
00:08:54,504 --> 00:09:00,78
If I now substitute the drift
velocity, which we have here,

125
00:09:00,78 --> 00:09:07,21
I substitute that in there,
but then I find that the

126
00:09:07,21 --> 00:09:13,262
current -- I get a E squared,
the charge squared,

127
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:17,8
I get N, I get tau,
I get downstairs,

128
00:09:17,8 --> 00:09:24,23
the mass of the electron,
and then I get A times the

129
00:09:24,23 --> 00:09:28,894
electric field E.
Because I have here,

130
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:36,048
is electric field E.
When you look at this here,

131
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:43,019
that really depends only on the
properties of by substance,

132
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,789
for a given temperature.
And we give that a name.

133
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:54,558
We call this sigma,
which is called conductivity.

134
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:57,924
Conductivity.
If I calculate,

135
00:09:57,924 --> 00:10:04,312
for copper, the conductivity,
at room temperature,

136
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:08,224
that's very easy,
because I've given you what N

137
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:12,561
is, on the blackboard there,
ten to the twenty-nine,

138
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:17,578
you know what tau is at room
temperature, three times ten to

139
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:20,384
the minus fourteen,
so for copper,

140
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:24,636
at room temperature,
you will find about ten to the

141
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:27,612
eighth.
You will see more values fro

142
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:30,418
sigma later on during this
course.

143
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:34,415
This is in SI units.
I can massage this a little

144
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:39,091
further, because E is V divided
by L,

145
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:46,248
and so I can write now that the
current is that sigma times A

146
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:52,093
times V divided by L.
I can write it down a little

147
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:55,433
bit differently,
I can say V,

148
00:10:55,433 --> 00:11:01,04
therefore, equals L divided by
sigma A, times I.

149
00:11:01,04 --> 00:11:07,719
And now, you're staring at
Ohm's Law, whether you like it

150
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:13,81
or not,
because this is what we call

151
00:11:13,81 --> 00:11:17,332
the resistance,
capital R.

152
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:25,783
We often write down rho for one
over sigma, and rho is called

153
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:31,135
the resistivity.
So either one will do.

154
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:40,995
So you can also write down --
you can write down V equals I R,

155
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:47,693
and this R, then,
is either L divided by sigma A,

156
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:56,065
or L times rho -- let me make
it a nicer rho -- divided by A.

157
00:11:56,065 --> 00:12:03,182
That's the same thing.
The units for resistance R is

158
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:08,485
volts per ampere,
but we call that ohm.

159
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:16,858
And so the unit for R is ohm.
And so if you want to know what

160
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:20,87
the
unit for rho and sigma is,

161
00:12:20,87 --> 00:12:24,273
that follows immediately from
the equations.

162
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:27,044
The unit for rho is then
ohm-meters.

163
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:31,239
So we have derived the
resistance here in terms of the

164
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:34,326
dimensions -- namely,
the length and the

165
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:38,6
cross-section -- but also in
terms of the physics on an

166
00:12:38,6 --> 00:12:41,292
atomic scale,
which, all by itself,

167
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,854
is interesting.
If you look at the resistance,

168
00:12:44,854 --> 00:12:48,89
you see it is proportional with
the

169
00:12:48,89 --> 00:12:52,459
length of your wire through
which you drive a current.

170
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,826
Think of this as water trying
to go through a pipe.

171
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:59,26
If you make the pipe longer,
the resistance goes up,

172
00:12:59,26 --> 00:13:01,617
so that's very intuitively
pleasing.

173
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:03,839
Notice that you have A
downstairs.

174
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,407
That means if the pipe is
wider, larger cross-section,

175
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:10,101
it's also easier for the
current to flow,

176
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,323
it's easier for the water to
flow.

177
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:15,42
So that's also quite pleasing.
Ohm's Law, also,

178
00:13:15,42 --> 00:13:21,123
often holds for insulators,
which are not conductors,

179
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:26,229
even though I have derived it
here for conductors,

180
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:29,459
which have these free
electrons.

181
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:35,295
And so now, I want to make a
comparison between very good

182
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:39,046
conductors, and very good
insulators.

183
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:44,048
So I'll start off with a -- a
chunk of material ,

184
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:52,384
cross-sectional area A -- let's
take it one millimeter by one

185
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:59,253
millimeter -- so A is ten to
the minus six square meters.

186
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:06,244
So here I have a chunk of
material, and the length of that

187
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:12,99
material L is one meter.
Put a potential difference over

188
00:14:12,99 --> 00:14:16,915
there, plus here,
and minus here.

189
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:23,538
Current will start to flow in
this direction,

190
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:26,81
electrons will flow in this
direction.

191
00:14:26,81 --> 00:14:31,23
The question now is,
what is the resistance of this

192
00:14:31,23 --> 00:14:34,236
chunk of material?
Well, very easy.

193
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:37,95
You take these equations,
you know L and A,

194
00:14:37,95 --> 00:14:42,812
so if I tell you what sigma is,
then you can immediately

195
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:45,641
calculate what the resistance
is.

196
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:49,001
So let's take,
first, a good conductor.

197
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:53,422
Silver and gold and copper are
very

198
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:57,528
good conductors.
They would have values of

199
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:02,937
sigma, ten to the eight,
we just calculated for copper,

200
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:06,643
you've seen in front of your
own eyes.

201
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:11,551
So that means rho would be ten
to the minus eight,

202
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:16,659
it's one over sigma.
And so in this particular case,

203
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:22,468
since A is ten to the minus
six, the resistance R is simply

204
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:26,498
ten to
the sixth times rho.

205
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:32,24
Because L is one meter.
So it's very easy -- resistance

206
00:15:32,24 --> 00:15:36,174
here, R, is ten to the minus two
ohms.

207
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:41,702
One-hundredth of an ohm.
For this material if it were

208
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:45,211
copper.
Let's now take a very good

209
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,401
insulator.
Glass is an example.

210
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:52,548
Quartz, porcelain,
very good insulators.

211
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:58,571
Now, sigma, the conductivity,
is extremely low.

212
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:03,867
They vary somewhere from ten to
the minus twelve through ten to

213
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,429
the minus sixteen.
So rho, now,

214
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:10,187
the resistivity,
is something like ten to the

215
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:15,141
twelve to twelve to the plus
sixteens, and if I take ten to

216
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,899
the fourteen,
just I grab -- I have to grab a

217
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,939
number -- then you'll find that
R, now, is ten to the twenty

218
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:26,416
ohms.
A one with twenty zeros.

219
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:32,519
That's an enormous resistance.
So you see the difference --

220
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,791
twenty-two orders of magnitude
difference between a good

221
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:41,374
conductor and a good insulator.
And if I make this potential

222
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:45,18
difference over the wire,
if I make that one volt,

223
00:16:45,18 --> 00:16:48,132
and if I apply Ohm's Law,
V equals I R,

224
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:52,715
then I can also calculate the
current that is going to flow.

225
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:55,666
If I R is one,
then the current here is

226
00:16:55,666 --> 00:17:00,172
hundred amperes,
and the current here is ten

227
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:07,612
to the minus twenty amperes,
an insignificant  current,

228
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:11,883
ten to the minus twenty
amperes.

229
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:19,875
I first want to demonstrate to
you that Ohm's Law sometimes

230
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,284
holds, I will do a
demonstration,

231
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:35,169
whereby you have a voltage
supply  -- put a V in here --

232
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:40,93
and we change the voltage in a
matter of a few seconds from

233
00:17:40,93 --> 00:17:45,002
zero to four volts.
This is the plus side,

234
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:50,168
this is the minus side,
I have connected it here to a

235
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:55,631
resistor which is fifty ohms --
we use this symbol for a

236
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:59,505
resistor -- and here is a
current meter.

237
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:04,174
And the current meter has
negligible resistance,

238
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:09,81
so you can ignore that.
And I'm going to show you on an

239
00:18:09,81 --> 00:18:13,334
oscilloscope -- we've never
discussed an oscilloscope,

240
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:17,057
but maybe we will in the future
-- I'm going to show you,

241
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:20,713
they are projected -- the
voltage unintelligible go from

242
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:22,841
zero to four,
versus the current.

243
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:26,497
And so it will start here,
and by the time we reach four

244
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:29,821
volts, then we would have
reached a current of four

245
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:32,48
divided by fifty,
according to Ohm's Law,

246
00:18:32,48 --> 00:18:35,937
I will write down just four
divided by fifty amperes,

247
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:39,582
which is point
oh eight amperes.

248
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:44,312
And if Ohm's Law holds,
then you would find a straight

249
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:47,169
line.
That's the whole idea about

250
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,542
Ohm's Law, that the potential
difference, linearly

251
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:56,184
proportional to the current.
You double the potential

252
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:59,04
difference, your current
doubles.

253
00:18:59,04 --> 00:19:02,878
So let's do that,
let's take a look at that,

254
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:07,876
you're going to see that there
-- and I have to change my

255
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:12,373
lights so
that you get a good shot at it

256
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:16,225
-- oh, it's already going.
So you see, horizontally,

257
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:18,868
we have the current,
and vertically,

258
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:22,644
we have the voltage.
And so it takes about a second

259
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:26,873
to go from zero to four -- so
this goes from zero to four

260
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:31,556
volts -- and you'll see that the
current is beautifully linear.

261
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:35,332
Yes, I'm blocking it -- oh,
no, it's my reflection,

262
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,806
that's interesting.
Ohm's Law doesn't allow for

263
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:42,76
that.
So you see how beautifully

264
00:19:42,76 --> 00:19:46,314
linear it is.
So now, you may have great

265
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:51,051
confidence in Ohm's Law.
Don't have any confidence in

266
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:54,422
Ohm's Law.
The conductivity sigma is a

267
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:57,52
strong function of the
temperature.

268
00:19:57,52 --> 00:20:01,984
If you increase the
temperature, then the time tau

269
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:07,451
between collisions goes down,
because the speed of these free

270
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:12,917
electrons goes up.
It's a very strong function

271
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:16,277
of temperature.
And so if tau goes down,

272
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:19,808
then clearly,
what will happen is that the

273
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:24,632
conductivity will go down.
And that means rho will go up.

274
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:29,455
And so you get more resistance.
And so when you heat up a

275
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:32,297
substance, the resistance goes
up.

276
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,657
A higher temperature,
higher resistance.

277
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:40,222
So the moment that the
resistance R becomes a function

278
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,941
of the
temperature,

279
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,354
I call that a total breakdown
of V equals I R,

280
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:50,602
a total breakdown of Ohm's Law.
If you look in your book,

281
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:53,484
they say, "Oh,
no, no, no, that's not a

282
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:56,594
breakdown.
You just have to adjust the re-

283
00:20:56,594 --> 00:21:00,311
the resistance for a different
temperature." Well,

284
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:04,862
yes, that's an incredible poor
man's way of saving a law that

285
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,503
is a very bad law.
Because the temperature itself

286
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:14,217
is a function of current,
the higher the current the

287
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:18,136
higher the temperature.
And so now, you get a ratio,

288
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:21,44
V divided by I,
which is no longer constant.

289
00:21:21,44 --> 00:21:24,206
It becomes a function of the
current.

290
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:28,662
That's the end of Ohm's Law.
And so I want to show you that

291
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:33,272
if I do the same experiment that
I did here, but if I replace

292
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:37,882
this by a light bulb of fifty
ohms -- it's a very small light

293
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:41,34
bulb, resistance when it is hot
is fifty ohms,

294
00:21:41,34 --> 00:21:45,087
when it is cold,
it is seven ohms.

295
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:48,801
So R cold of the light bulb is
roughly seven ohms,

296
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:53,349
I believe, but I know that when
it is hot, it's very close to

297
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:56,457
the fifty ohms.
Think it's a little lower.

298
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:59,792
What do you expect now?
Well, you expect now,

299
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:03,431
that when the resistance is low
in the beginning,

300
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:06,539
you get this,
and then when the resistance

301
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,04
goes up, you're going to get
this.

302
00:22:09,04 --> 00:22:13,285
I may end up a little higher
current, because I think the

303
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:17,702
resistance is a
little lower than fifty ohms.

304
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:21,599
And if you see a curve like
this, that's not linear anymore.

305
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,629
So that's the end of Ohm's Law.
And that's what I want to show

306
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,214
you now.
So, all I do is,

307
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:31,243
here I have this little light
bulb -- for those of you who sit

308
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:35,14
close, they can actually see
that light bulb  start glowing,

309
00:22:35,14 --> 00:22:38,839
but that's not important,
I really want you to see that V

310
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,614
versus I is no longer linear,
there you go.

311
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:44,322
And you see,
every time you see this light

312
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:50,494
bulb go on, it heats up,
and during the heating up,

313
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,107
it, um, the resistance
increases.

314
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:59,753
And it's the end of Ohm's Law,
for this light bulb,

315
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,592
at least.
It was fine for the other

316
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:09,125
resistor, but it was not fine
for this light bulb.

317
00:23:09,125 --> 0.

318
0. --> 00:23:12,738
There is another way that I can
That is the resistivity,

319
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:20,755
show you that Ohm's Law is not
always doing so well.

320
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:25,568
I have a hundred twenty-five
volt power supply,

321
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:31,95
so V is hundred and twenty-five
volts -- this is the potential

322
00:23:31,95 --> 00:23:37,601
difference -- and I have a light
bulb, you see it here,

323
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:43,565
that's the light bulb -- the
resistance of the light bulb,

324
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:47,332
cold, I believe,
is twenty-five ohms,

325
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:53,192
and hot, is about two hundred
and fifty ohms.

326
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:57,141
A huge difference.
So if the  resistance -- if I

327
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:01,763
take the cold resistance,
then I would get five amperes,

328
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:06,89
but by the time that the bulb
is hot, I would only get half an

329
00:24:06,89 --> 00:24:09,411
ampere.
It's a huge difference.

330
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:14,117
And what I want to show you,
again with the oscilloscope,

331
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:17,142
is the current as a function of
time.

332
00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:23,698
When you switch on a light
bulb, you would expect,

333
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:26,879
if Ohm's Law holds,
that when you switch on the

334
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:30,753
current -- or switch on the
voltage, I should say -- that

335
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:33,797
you see this.
This is then your five amperes.

336
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:37,325
And that it would stay there.
That's the whole idea.

337
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:41,198
Namely, that the voltage
divided by the current remains a

338
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:43,827
constant.
However, what you're going to

339
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:46,11
see is like this.
Current goes up,

340
00:24:46,11 --> 00:24:50,122
but then the resistance goes
down, then the resistance goes

341
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:55,356
up, when the current goes up,
the resistance goes up,

342
00:24:55,356 --> 00:24:59,193
and then therefore the current
will go down,

343
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:04,279
and will level off at a level
which is substantially below

344
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:07,045
this.
So you're looking there --

345
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:10,971
you're staring at the breakdown
of Ohm's Law.

346
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:14,629
And so that's what I want to
show you now.

347
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:19,983
So, here we need a hundred and
twenty five volts -- and there

348
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:25,516
is the light bulb,
and when I throw this switch,

349
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:29,414
you will see the pattern of the
current versus time -- you will

350
00:25:29,414 --> 00:25:32,37
only see it once,
and then we freeze it with the

351
00:25:32,37 --> 00:25:35,388
oscilloscope -- turn this off --
so look closely,

352
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:36,394
now.
There it is.

353
00:25:36,394 --> 00:25:39,224
Forget these little ripple that
you see on it,

354
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:42,746
it has to do with the way that
we produce the hundred and

355
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:45,135
twenty five volts.
And so you see here,

356
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,588
horizontally,
time, the time between two

357
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,48
adjacent vertical lines is
twenty milliseconds.

358
00:25:50,48 --> 00:25:52,304
And so, indeed,
very early on,

359
00:25:52,304 --> 00:25:56,769
the current surged toward -- to
a very high value,

360
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:01,939
and then the filament heats up,
and so the resistance goes up,

361
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:05,754
the light bulb,
and the current just goes back

362
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:08,636
again.
From the far left to the far

363
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:13,128
right on the screen is about two
hundred milliseconds.

364
00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:16,095
That's about two tenths of a
second.

365
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:20,757
And here you get a current
level which is way lower than

366
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:24,656
what you get there.
That's a breakdown of Ohm's

367
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:27,453
Law.
It is actually very nice that

368
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:31,777
resistances go up with light
bulbs

369
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:34,982
when the temperature goes up.
Because, suppose it were the

370
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:37,456
other way around.
Suppose you turn on a light

371
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:39,593
bulb, and the resistance would
go down.

372
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:41,843
Light bulb got hot,
resistance goes down,

373
00:26:41,843 --> 00:26:44,486
that means the current goes up.
Instead of down,

374
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:47,073
the current goes up.
That means it gets hotter.

375
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,772
That means the resistance goes
even further down.

376
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:52,19
That means the current goes
even further up.

377
00:26:52,19 --> 00:26:55,395
And so what it would mean is
that every time you turn on a

378
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:58,151
light bulb, it would,
right in front of your eyes,

379
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:00,232
destruct itself.
That's not happening.

380
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:03,775
It's the other way around.
So, in a way,

381
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:09,027
it's fortunate that the
resistance goes up when the

382
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:12,179
light bulbs get hot.
All right.

383
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:18,692
Let's now be a little bit more
qualitative on some  networks of

384
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:24,68
resistors, and we'll have you do
a few problems like that,

385
00:27:24,68 --> 00:27:30,774
whereby we just will assume,
naively, that Ohm's Law holds.

386
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:37,092
In other words,
we will always assume that the

387
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:42,701
values for the resistances that
we give you will not change.

388
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:48,594
So we will assume that the heat
that is produced will not  play

389
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:53,252
any important role.
So we will just use Ohm's Law,

390
00:27:53,252 --> 00:27:58,67
for now, and if you can't use
it, we will be very specific

391
00:27:58,67 --> 00:28:01,902
about that.
So suppose I have here,

392
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:07,32
between point A and point B,
suppose I have two resistors,

393
00:28:07,32 --> 00:28:13,349
R one and R two.
And suppose I apply a potential

394
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:16,995
difference between A and B,
that this be plus,

395
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:20,965
and this be minus,
and the potential difference is

396
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,343
V.
And you know V,

397
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:24,53
this is known,
I give you V,

398
00:28:24,53 --> 00:28:28,663
I gave you this resistance,
and I gave you that one.

399
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:32,714
So I could ask you now,
what is the current that is

400
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:35,55
going to flow?
I could also ask you,

401
00:28:35,55 --> 00:28:40,087
then, what is the potential
difference over this resistor

402
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:44,994
alone --
which I will call V one -- and

403
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:50,315
what is the potential difference
over the second resistor,

404
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:54,89
which I call V two?
Very straightforward question.

405
00:28:54,89 --> 00:28:57,783
Well, you apply,
now, Ohm's Law,

406
00:28:57,783 --> 00:29:02,171
and so between A and B,
there are two resistors,

407
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:05,345
in series.
So the current has to go

408
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:09,453
through both,
and so the potential difference

409
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:13,747
V, in Ohm's Law,
is now the total current times

410
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:18,714
R one plus R two.
Suppose these two resistors

411
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:21,44
were the same,
they had the same length,

412
00:29:21,44 --> 00:29:25,005
same cross-sectional area.
If you put two in series,

413
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:28,709
you have twice the length.
Well, so, twice the length,

414
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:32,413
remember, resistance is
linearly proportional with the

415
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:35,208
length of a wire,
and so you add them up.

416
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:38,843
So now you know R one and you
know R two, you know V,

417
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,918
so you already know the
current, very simple.

418
00:29:41,918 --> 00:29:45,342
You can also apply Ohm's Law,
as long as it holds,

419
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:50,637
for this resistor alone.
So then you get that V one

420
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:54,992
equals I times R one,
so now you have the voltage

421
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:57,986
over this resistor,
and of course,

422
00:29:57,986 --> 00:30:01,525
V two must be the current I
times R two.

423
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:04,7
And so you have solved your
problem.

424
00:30:04,7 --> 00:30:10,144
All the questions that I asked
you, you have  the answers to.

425
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:14,318
We could now have a slightly
different problem,

426
00:30:14,318 --> 00:30:18,855
whereby point A is here,
but now we have a resistor

427
00:30:18,855 --> 00:30:22,73
here,
which is R one,

428
00:30:22,73 --> 00:30:24,777
and we have here,
R two.

429
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:27,803
This is point B,
and this is R two.

430
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:32,163
And the potential difference is
V, that is, again,

431
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:37,592
given, and now I could ask you,
what, now, is the current that

432
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:41,419
will flow here?
And then I can also ask you,

433
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:46,847
what is the current that would
go through one -- resistor one,

434
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:52,097
and what is the current that
could go through

435
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:56,721
resistor two?
And I would allow you to use

436
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,541
Ohm's Law.
So now you say,

437
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:03,601
"Aha!
The potential difference from A

438
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:09,014
to B going this route,
that potential difference,

439
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:15,443
is V, that's a given." So V
must now be I one times R one.

440
00:31:15,443 --> 00:31:19,841
That's Ohm's Law,
for this upper branch.

441
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:24,352
But, of course,
you can also go the lower

442
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:29,505
branch.
So the same V is also I two

443
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:33,561
times R two.
But whatever current comes in

444
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:39,299
here must split up between these
two, think of it as water.

445
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:44,74
You cannot get rid of charges.
The number of charges per

446
00:31:44,74 --> 00:31:49,39
second that flow into this
juncture continue on,

447
00:31:49,39 --> 00:31:54,139
and so I, the total current,
is I one plus I two.

448
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:58,324
And so now,
you see, you have all the

449
00:31:58,324 --> 00:32:02,754
ingredients that you need to
solve for the current I -- for

450
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,115
the current I one,
and for the current I two.

451
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:10,774
And you can turn this into an
industry, you can make extremely

452
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:14,898
complicated networks of
resistors -- and if you were in

453
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:19,175
course six, you should love it
-- I don't like it at all,

454
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:23,376
so you don't have to worry
about it, you're not going to

455
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:27,73
get very complicated resistor
net- networks

456
00:32:27,73 --> 00:32:33,772
from me -- but in course six,
you're going to see a lot of

457
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:37,482
them.
They're going to throw them --

458
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:43,63
stuff them down your throat.
The conductivity of a substan-

459
00:32:43,63 --> 00:32:49,461
substance goes up if I can
increase the number of charge

460
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:52,535
carriers.
If we have  dry air,

461
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:57,199
and it is cold,
then the resistivity of cold,

462
00:32:57,199 --> 00:33:04,247
dry air at
one atmosphere -- so rho for

463
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:10,323
air, cold,  dry,
one atmosphere -- cold means

464
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:19,024
temperature that we have outside
-- it's about four times ten to

465
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:25,101
the thirteen.
That is the resistivity of air.

466
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:34,888
It is  about what it is in
this room, maybe a little

467
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:38,912
lower, because the temperature
is a little higher.

468
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:43,675
If I heat it up -- the air --
then the conductivity will go

469
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:45,975
up.
Resistivity will go down,

470
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:49,259
because now,
I create oxygen and nitrogen

471
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,53
ions by heating up the air.
Remember when we had this

472
00:33:53,53 --> 00:33:58,128
lightning, the unintelligible
came down, and we created a

473
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:04,451
channel full of ions and
electrons, that had a very low

474
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:07,732
resistivity,
a very high conductivity.

475
00:34:07,732 --> 00:34:11,278
And so what I want to
demonstrate to you,

476
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:16,686
that when I create ions in this
room, that I can actually make

477
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:20,409
the conductivity of air go up
tremendously.

478
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,931
Not only will the electrons
move, but also the ions,

479
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:29,452
now, will start to move.
And the way I'm going to do

480
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:34,594
that is, I'm going to put charge
on the electroscope -- oh,

481
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:39,388
that is not so good --
no harm done.

482
00:34:39,388 --> 00:34:44,393
I'm going to put charge on the
electroscope,

483
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:50,795
and you will see that the
conductivity of air is so poor

484
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:54,637
that it will stay there for
hours.

485
00:34:54,637 --> 00:35:00,341
And then what I will do,
I will create ions in the

486
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:07,325
vicinity of the electroscope.
But let's first put some charge

487
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:15,24
on the electroscope.
I have here a glass rod  and

488
00:35:15,24 --> 00:35:20,929
I'll put some charge on it.
OK, that's a lot of charge.

489
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:27,039
And, uh, the r- the air is
quite dry, conductivity is very,

490
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:33,465
very small, and so the charge
cannot go off through the air to

491
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,626
the surroundings,
to the earth.

492
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:42,42
But now I'm going to create
ions there by heating it up,

493
00:35:42,42 --> 00:35:49,059
and I decided to do that with a
candle, because a candle is

494
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:51,437
very romantic,
as we all know.

495
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:56,111
So here I have this candle  --
look how well the charge is

496
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:59,063
holding, eh?
-- and here's my candle.

497
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:03,82
And I will bring the candle --
oh, maybe twenty centimeters

498
00:36:03,82 --> 00:36:07,51
from the electroscope.
Look at it, look at it,

499
00:36:07,51 --> 00:36:11,118
already going.
It's about fifteen centimeters

500
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,578
away.
I'll take my candle away,

501
00:36:13,578 --> 00:36:19,506
and it stops again.
So it's all due to the fact

502
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:25,302
that I'm ionizing the air there,
creating free electrons as well

503
00:36:25,302 --> 00:36:30,178
as ions, and they both
participate now in the current,

504
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:35,422
and the charge can flow away
from the electroscope through

505
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:39,929
the earth, because the
conductivity now is so much

506
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:41,769
higher.
I stop again,

507
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:45,633
and it stops.
You see in front of your eyes

508
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:49,865
how important the temperature
is, in this case,

509
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:54,648
the presence of the ions in the
air.

510
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:58,087
If I have clean,
distilled water -- I mean,

511
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:01,608
clean water.
I don't mean the stuff that you

512
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:05,456
get in Cambridge,
let alone did I mean the stuff

513
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:09,386
that is in the Charles River,
I mean clean water,

514
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:13,562
that has a pH of seven.
That means one out of ten to

515
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:18,311
the seven of the water molecules
is ionized, H plus and O H

516
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:20,194
minus.
The conductivity,

517
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:24,369
by the way, is not the result
of the

518
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,686
free electrons,
but is really the result of

519
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:32,503
these H plus and O H minus ions.
It's one of the cases whereby

520
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:37,004
not the -- the electrons are
maj- the major responsibility

521
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,637
for the current.
If I have add three percent of

522
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:45,059
salt, in terms of weight,
then all that salt will ionize,

523
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:49,639
so you get sodium plus and C L
minus ions, you increase the

524
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:52,482
number of ions by an enormous
factor.

525
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:56,51
And so the conductivity will
soar up

526
00:37:56,51 --> 00:38:01,609
by a factor of three hundred
thousand, or up to a million,

527
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:05,545
because you increase the ions
by that amount.

528
00:38:05,545 --> 00:38:10,824
And so it's no surprise then,
for you, that the conductivity

529
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:15,744
of seawater is a million times
higher -- think about it,

530
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:21,023
a million times higher -- than
the conductivity of distilled

531
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:24,065
water.
And I would like to give you

532
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:31,625
the number for water --
so this is distilled water  --

533
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:39,002
that is about two times ten to
the fifth ohm-meters.

534
00:38:39,002 --> 0.

535
0. --> 00:38:42,619
There is another way that I can
That is the resistivity,

536
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:47,682
two times ten to the five
oh-meters.

537
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:53,468
I have here,
a bucket of distilled water.

538
00:38:53,468 --> 00:39:04,461
I'll make a drawing for you on
the blackboard there.

539
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:09,643
So here is a bucket of
distilled water,

540
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:13,871
and in there,
is a copper plate,

541
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:20,689
and another copper plate,
and here is a light bulb,

542
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:27,643
and this will go straight  to
the outlet [wssshhht],

543
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:34,052
stick it in,
hundred ten volts.

544
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:38,48
This light bulb has eight
hundred ohm resistance when it

545
00:39:38,48 --> 00:39:41,298
is hot.
You see the light bulb here.

546
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:45,806
You can calculate what this
resistance is between the two

547
00:39:45,806 --> 00:39:49,589
plates, that's easy,
you have all the tools now.

548
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:54,017
If you know the distance,
it's about twenty centimeters,

549
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,479
and you know the surface area
of the plates,

550
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:01,021
because remember,
the resistance is inversely

551
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:06,253
proportional with A,
so you have to take that into

552
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:09,914
account -- and you take the
resistivity of water into

553
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:13,646
account, it's a trivial
calculation, you can calculate

554
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:16,673
what the resistance is of this
portion here.

555
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:20,123
And I found that this
resistance here is about two

556
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:21,953
megaohms.
Two million ohms.

557
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:26,107
So, when I plug this into a
wall, the current that will flow

558
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:29,275
is extremely low,
because it has to go through

559
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:32,936
the eight hundred ohms,
and through the two megaohms.

560
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:36,738
So you won't see anything,
the light bulb will not show

561
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:38,765
any
light.

562
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:43,47
But now, if I -- put salt in
here, if I really manage to put

563
00:40:43,47 --> 00:40:48,494
three percent in weight salt in
here, then this two megaohm will

564
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:51,763
go down to two ohms,
a million times less.

565
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:56,627
So now, the light bulb will be
happy like a clam at high tide,

566
00:40:56,627 --> 00:41:00,216
because two ohms here,
plus the eight hundred,

567
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:04,522
the two is insignificant.
And this is what I want to --

568
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:08,03
to demonstrate to you now,
the

569
00:41:08,03 --> 00:41:11,965
enormous importance of
increasing ions.

570
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:16,108
I increased ions here by
heating the air,

571
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:21,182
now I'm going to increase the
ions by adding salt.

572
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:27,498
And so the first thing that I
will do is, I will stick this in

573
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:30,398
here.
There's the light bulb.

574
00:41:30,398 --> 00:41:36,197
And I make a daring prediction
that you will see nothing.

575
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:38,268
There we go.
Nothing.

576
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:44,531
Isn't that amazing?
You didn't expect that,

577
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:46,916
right?
Physics works.

578
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:51,806
You see nothing.
If I take the plates out,

579
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:57,53
and touch them with each other,
what will happen?

580
00:41:57,53 --> 00:42:02,658
There you go.
But this water has such a huge

581
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:07,189
resistance that the current is
too low.

582
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:14,822
Well, let's add some -- not
pepper -- add some salt.

583
00:42:14,822 --> 00:42:19,823
Yes, there's salt in there.
It's about as much as I would

584
00:42:19,823 --> 00:42:24,467
put on my eggs in the morning --
stir a little -- ah,

585
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:27,771
hey, look at that.
Isn't that amazing?

586
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:32,861
And when I bring them closer
together, it will become even

587
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:37,327
brighter, because L is now
smaller, the distance is

588
00:42:37,327 --> 00:42:40,452
smaller.
I bring them farther apart,

589
00:42:40,452 --> 00:42:42,774
it's amazing.
Just a teeny,

590
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:48,551
weeny little bit of salt,
about as much as I use on my

591
00:42:48,551 --> 00:42:53,353
egg, let alone -- what the hell,
let's put everything in there

592
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:57,21
-- that's a unintelligible I put
everything, then,

593
00:42:57,21 --> 00:43:00,752
of course, you go almost down
to the two ohms,

594
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:04,531
and the light bulb will be just
burning normally.

595
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:08,782
But even with that little bit
of salt, you saw the huge

596
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:11,537
difference.
My body is a fairly good

597
00:43:11,537 --> 00:43:15,63
conductor -- yours too,
we all came out of the sea --

598
00:43:15,63 --> 00:43:20,764
so we are almost
all water -- and therefore,

599
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,735
when we do experiments with
little charge,

600
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:28,416
like the van der Graf,
being a student,

601
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:33,161
then we have to insulate
ourselves very carefully,

602
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:37,81
putting glass plates under us,
or plastic stools,

603
00:43:37,81 --> 00:43:42,556
to prevent that the charge runs
down to the earth.

604
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:47,689
In fact, the resistance,
my resistance between my body

605
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:52,629
and the earth is largely
dictated by the soles of my

606
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:56,113
shoe,
not by my body,

607
00:43:56,113 --> 00:44:00,272
not by my skin.
But if you look at my soles,

608
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:05,398
then you get something like
this, and it has a certain

609
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:09,363
thickness, and this,
maybe one centimeter.

610
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:14,392
This, now, is L in my
calculation for the resistance,

611
00:44:14,392 --> 00:44:18,454
because current may flow in
this direction,

612
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:22,226
so that's L.
Well, how large is my foot?

613
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:29,298
Let's say it's one foot long --
no pun implied -- and let's say

614
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:34,649
it's about ten centimeters wide.
So you can calculate what the

615
00:44:34,649 --> 00:44:37,895
surface area A is,
you know what L is,

616
00:44:37,895 --> 00:44:42,018
and if you know,
now what the resistivity is for

617
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:47,194
my sole, I can make a rough
guess, I looked up the material,

618
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:51,668
and I found that the
resistivity is about ten to the

619
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:56,054
tenth.
So I can now calculate what the

620
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:58,41
resistance is in this
direction.

621
00:44:58,41 --> 00:45:01,221
And I found that that
resistance then,

622
00:45:01,221 --> 00:45:04,868
putting in the numbers,
is about ten billion ohm.

623
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,755
And you will say,
"Wow!" Oh, it's four,

624
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,579
actually.
Well, big deal.

625
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:12,086
Four billion ohm.
So you will say,

626
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:15,733
"That's enormous resistance!"
Well, first of all,

627
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:19,684
I'm walking on two feet,
not on one, so if I would be

628
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:23,939
standing one the whole lecture,
it would probably be four

629
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:28,878
billion, but if I have two feet
on the ground,

630
00:45:28,878 --> 00:45:31,37
it's really two billion,
you will say,

631
00:45:31,37 --> 00:45:34,2
"Well, that's still extremely
large!" Well,

632
00:45:34,2 --> 00:45:36,76
it may look large,
but it really isn't,

633
00:45:36,76 --> 00:45:40,735
because all the experiments
that we are doing here in twenty

634
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,834
six one hundred,
you're dealing with very small

635
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:46,934
amounts of charge.
Even if you take the van der

636
00:45:46,934 --> 00:45:50,706
Graff -- the van der Graff,
say, has two hundred thousand

637
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,749
volts -- and let's assume that
my resistance is two times ten

638
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:57,444
to the nine ohms,
two feet on the ground.

639
00:45:57,444 --> 00:46:01,014
So when I touch the van der
Graff,

640
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:04,587
the current that would flow,
according to Ohm's Law,

641
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:08,509
would be hundred microamperes.
That means, in one second,

642
00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:11,732
I can take hundred
microCoulombs of the van der

643
00:46:11,732 --> 00:46:16,004
Graff, but the van der Graff has
only ten microCoulombs on in.

644
00:46:16,004 --> 00:46:19,857
So the resistance of four
billion or two billion ohms is

645
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:23,359
way too low for these
experiments that we have been

646
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,492
doing in twenty six one hundred,
and that's why we use these

647
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:30,574
plastic stools,
and we use these glass plates

648
00:46:30,574 --> 00:46:34,427
in order to make sure that the
current

649
00:46:34,427 --> 00:46:39,683
is not draining off the  the
charge that we need for the

650
00:46:39,683 --> 00:46:43,602
experiments.
I want to demonstrate that to

651
00:46:43,602 --> 00:46:48,094
you, that, indeed,
even with my shoes on -- that

652
00:46:48,094 --> 00:46:54,019
means, even with my two billion
ohm resistance to the ground --

653
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:58,894
that it will be very difficult
for me, for instance,

654
00:46:58,894 --> 00:47:02,048
to keep charge on an
electroscope.

655
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:07,591
I'm going to put charge on this
electroscope by scuffing my

656
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:12,617
feet.
But, since I keep my -- I have

657
00:47:12,617 --> 00:47:16,529
my shoes on, I'm not standing on
the glass plate,

658
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:19,056
the charge will flow through
me.

659
00:47:19,056 --> 00:47:23,376
You can apply Ohm's Law.
And you will see that as I do

660
00:47:23,376 --> 00:47:28,267
this -- I'm scuffing my feet now
-- that I can only keep that

661
00:47:28,267 --> 00:47:32,098
electroscope charged as long as
I keep scuffing.

662
00:47:32,098 --> 00:47:35,848
But the moment that I stop
scuffing, it's gone.

663
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:38,538
Start scuffing again,
that's fine,

664
00:47:38,538 --> 00:47:42,699
but the moment that I
stop scuffing,

665
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:46,627
it goes off again.
Even though this resistance is

666
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:51,537
something like two billion ohms.
Let alone if I take my shoes

667
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:53,582
off.
I apologize for that.

668
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:57,265
If now I scuff,
I can't even get any charge on

669
00:47:57,265 --> 00:47:59,638
the electroscope,
because now,

670
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:02,665
the resistance is so
ridiculously low,

671
00:48:02,665 --> 00:48:05,775
I don't even have the two
billion ohms,

672
00:48:05,775 --> 00:48:09,621
I can't even put any charge on
the electroscope.

673
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:14,039
It's always very difficult for
us to

674
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:19,569
do these experiments unless we
insulate ourselves very well.

675
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:23,786
And if, somehow,
the weather is a little damp,

676
00:48:23,786 --> 00:48:28,097
we can very thin films of water
onto our tools,

677
00:48:28,097 --> 00:48:33,813
and then the current can flow
off just through these very thin

678
00:48:33,813 --> 00:48:38,218
layers of water.
That's why we always like to do

679
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:43,747
these experiments in winter,
so that the conductivity of the

680
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:46,933
air is very low,
no water anywhere.

681
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:51,525
Here you see a slide of a
robbery.

682
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:57,064
I have scuffed my feet across
the rug, and I am armed with a

683
00:48:57,064 --> 00:49:00,725
static charge.
Hand over all your money,

684
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:05,701
or I'll touch your nose.
This person either never took

685
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:08,987
eight oh two,
or he is wearing very,

686
00:49:08,987 --> 49:14
very special shoes.
See you on Wednesday.
