1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,341



2
00:00:00,341 --> 00:00:05,085
When I expose material to an
external magnetic field,

3
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:10,558
then we learned last time that
the field inside that material

4
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,39
is modified.
And we expressed that in terms

5
00:00:14,39 --> 00:00:18,039
of an equation,
that the field inside the

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,692
material is kappa of M,
which is called the relative

7
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:26,159
permeability,
times the external field,

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:30,265
and I will refer to that all
the

9
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:34,154
time as the vacuum field.
And when we have diamagnetic

10
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:37,749
material, kappa M is just a hair
smaller than one;

11
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:41,859
with paramagnetic material,
it is a hair larger than one;

12
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,822
but when we have ferromagnetic
material it can be huge.

13
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:48,317
It can be thousands,
ten thousands,

14
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:51,545
and even higher.
Now in the case of para- and

15
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:55,508
ferromagnetic material,
the kappa of M is the result of

16
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:59,544
the fact that the intrinsic
dipoles of the atoms and the

17
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:03,669
molecules are
going to be aligned by the

18
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:06,923
external field.
And today I want to raise the

19
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:10,917
question, how large can the
magnetic dipole moment of a

20
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:13,949
single atom be?
And then comes the logical

21
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,056
question, how strong can we
actually, then,

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,162
have a field inside
ferromagnetic material?

23
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:24,6
That means if we were able to
align all the dipole moments of

24
00:01:24,6 --> 00:01:27,929
all the atoms,
what is the maximum that we can

25
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:30,369
achieve?
To calculate the magnetic

26
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,307
dipole
moment of an atom,

27
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:37,116
you have to do some quantum
mechanics, and that's beyond the

28
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:40,28
scope of this course.
And so I will derive it in a

29
00:01:40,28 --> 00:01:43,185
classical way,
and then at the very end I will

30
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:46,801
add a little pepper and salt,
which is quantum mechanics,

31
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:50,223
just to make the result right.
But it can be done in a

32
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:52,806
classical way,
and it can give you a very

33
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:55,518
good, good idea.
If I have a hydrogen atom,

34
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:59,198
which has a proton at the
center, has a charge plus E -- E

35
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:02,878
is the charge of the electron
but this is the plus charge.

36
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:07,122
And let this have an orbit
R, circular orbit.

37
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:10,942
And the electron here E,
I'll give it the minus sign to

38
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:13,912
make sure that you know that
it's negative.

39
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:17,166
Say the electron goes around in
this direction.

40
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,713
This is the velocity of the
electron.

41
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:23,957
That means that of course the
current around the proton would

42
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:27,918
then be in this direction.
If an electron goes like this,

43
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:31,667
the current goes like that,
that's just by convention.

44
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:35,841
The mass of an electron -- you
should know that by now -- is

45
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:40,743
approximately nine point one
times ten to the minus

46
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:44,34
thirty-one kilograms.
The charge of the electron,

47
00:02:44,34 --> 00:02:48,386
one point six times ten to the
minus nineteen coulombs.

48
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:52,807
And the radius of the orbit in
a hydrogen atom -- it's often

49
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,779
called the Bohr radius,
by the way -- is approximately

50
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:59,851
five times ten to the minus
eleven meters.

51
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:02,324
We're going to need these
numbers.

52
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:05,021
That's why I write them down
for you.

53
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:10,266
If you look at this current
running around the proton,

54
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:13,582
it's really a current which the
current, say,

55
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:17,275
goes in this direction.
And here is that proton --

56
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:20,441
trying to make you see three
dimensionally.

57
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:24,209
Then it creates a magnetic
field in this direction,

58
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,374
and so the magnetic dipole
moment mu is up.

59
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,991
And the magnitude of that
magnetic dipole moment,

60
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:35,061
as we learned last time,
is simply this current I times

61
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:40,562
the area A of this current loop.
Now the area A is trivial

62
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:43,36
to calculate.
That's pi R square,

63
00:03:43,36 --> 00:03:46,071
R being the radius of the
orbit.

64
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:50,005
And so A, that's the easiest,
is pi R squared.

65
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:54,376
And if I use my five times ten
to the minus eleven,

66
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:59,36
then I find that this area is
eight times ten to the minus

67
00:03:59,36 --> 00:04:02,857
twenty-one square meters.
So that's easy.

68
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:06,092
But now comes the question,
what is I?

69
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:11,163
What is the current?
So now we have to do a

70
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:14,466
little bit more work.
And we have to combine our

71
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:17,066
knowledge of,
uh eight oh two with our

72
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:20,931
knowledge of eight oh one.
If this electron goes around,

73
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:24,796
the reason why it goes around
is that the proton and the

74
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:28,943
electron attract each other.
And so there is a force in this

75
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:31,262
direction.
And we know that force,

76
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:34,635
that's the Coulomb force.
It's an electric force.

77
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:38,5
That force is this charge times
this charge, so that's E

78
00:04:38,5 --> 00:04:42,365
squared, divided by our famous
four pi

79
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,559
epsilon zero,
and then we have to divide it

80
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:49,057
by the radius squared.
So that's Coulomb's Law.

81
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:52,631
But from eight oh one,
from Newtonian mechanics,

82
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:57,118
we know that this is what we
call the centripetal force that

83
00:04:57,118 --> 00:04:59,399
holds it in orbit,
so to speak,

84
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,973
and that is M V squared,
M being the mass of the

85
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:06,243
electron, V being the speed of
the electron,

86
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:10,121
and V squared divided by R.
And so this allows me to

87
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:13,399
calculate
as a first step,

88
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,95
before we get into the current,
what the velocity of this

89
00:05:17,95 --> 00:05:20,225
electron is.
It's phenomenal.

90
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:24,776
It's an incredible speed.
So V then becomes -- I lose one

91
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:29,408
R -- so I get the square root,
I get an E squared upstairs

92
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:33,878
here, my M goes downstairs,
I have four pi epsilon zero,

93
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:37,941
and I have here an R.
And I know all these numbers.

94
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:41,354
I know what E is,
I know what capital R is,

95
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:45,742
I know what four pi epsilon
zero is --

96
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:49,944
one over four pi epsilon zero
is the famous nine to the power

97
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:52,395
-- nine times ten to the power
nine.

98
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,636
And so I can calculate what V
is.

99
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:58,908
And if I stick in the numbers
and if I did not make a mistake,

100
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:02,62
then I find about two point
three times ten to the six

101
00:06:02,62 --> 00:06:05,911
meters per second.
It's an immensely high speed,

102
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:09,903
five million miles per hour.
If this were a straight line,

103
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,124
you would make it to the moon
in three minutes.

104
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:17,046
Five million miles per hour
this electron goes around the

105
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:20,256
proton.
Now I have to go to the

106
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:22,37
current.
I have to find out what the

107
00:06:22,37 --> 00:06:24,847
current is.
So the question that I'm going

108
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:28,351
to ask now is how long does it
take for this electron to go

109
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,741
around.
Well, that time,

110
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,943
capital T, is of course the
circumference of my circle

111
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:35,117
divided by the speed of the
electron.

112
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:37,353
Trivial.
Even the high school students

113
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,192
in my audience will understand
that one, I hope.

114
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,817
And so I know what two pi R is,
because I know R and I know V

115
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:47,2
and so I can calculate that
time, just by sticking in the

116
00:06:47,2 --> 00:06:50,946
numbers.
And I find that it is about one

117
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:55,04
point one four times ten to the
minus sixteen seconds.

118
00:06:55,04 --> 00:06:57,743
Just imagine how small that
time is.

119
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:02,069
You cannot even -- we cannot
even imagine what it's like.

120
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,932
It goes ten to the sixteen
times per second around,

121
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:10,49
because it has this huge speed.
The one point one four times

122
00:07:10,49 --> 00:07:15,279
ten to the minus sixteen really
should have been one point four

123
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,069
times ten to the minus sixteen.
Of course, it doesn't make much

124
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:24,704
difference, but in case you
substitute in the

125
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:29,264
numbers, it is one point four
times ten to the minus sixteen.

126
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:34,053
Now, we still haven't found the
current, but we're almost there.

127
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:38,234
Because when you look here,
there is this electron going

128
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:42,491
by, and every one point one four
ten to the minus sixteen

129
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:46,139
seconds, that electron goes by.
So the current I,

130
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,32
that's the definition of
current, is the charge per unit

131
00:07:50,32 --> 00:07:53,057
time.
And so every capital T seconds,

132
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,934
the charge E goes by,
and so this is

133
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,846
per definition the current.
And so this current,

134
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:04,676
then, that you have,
which is simply due to the

135
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:09,255
electron going around the
proton, is about one point one

136
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,252
times ten to the minus three
amperes.

137
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:15,583
And that is mind-boggling.
A milliampere.

138
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:20,495
One electron going around a
proton represents a current of a

139
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:23,825
milliampere.
And now of course I have the

140
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:28,238
magnetic moment mu,
that is I times A.

141
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:31,881
We already calculated A,
and now we also have the

142
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:36,208
current I, and so we now get
that mu is approximately nine

143
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:40,23
point three, if you put in all
the decimals correctly,

144
00:08:40,23 --> 00:08:44,253
times ten to the minus
twenty-four, and the unit is of

145
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:47,441
course amperes square meters.
This is area,

146
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:51,161
and this is current.
This A has nothing to do with

147
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:53,286
that A, hey.
This is amperes.

148
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:56,095
Be careful.
And this is square meters.

149
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:59,434
But these are the units.
And this has a name.

150
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:03,381
This is called the Bohr
magneton.

151
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:07,292
Bohr magneton.
What we cannot understand with

152
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:11,38
our knowledge now,
but you can if you ever take

153
00:09:11,38 --> 00:09:15,735
quantum mechanics,
that the magnetic moment of all

154
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:20,712
electrons in orbit can only be a
multiple of this number,

155
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:24
nothing in between.
Quantum mechanics,

156
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26,844
the word says it is
quantization.

157
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:29,954
It's not in between.
It's either or.

158
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:34,982
It includes even zero,
which is even harder to

159
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:37,855
understand, that it could even
be zero.

160
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:42,543
In addition to a dipole moment
due to the electron going around

161
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:47,08
the proton, the electron itself
is a charge which spins about

162
00:09:47,08 --> 00:09:50,029
its own axis,
and that also means that a

163
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,566
charge is going around on the
spinning scale of the electron.

164
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:58,498
And that magnetic dipole moment
is always this value.

165
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:03,11
And so the net magnetic dipole
moment of an atom or a molecule

166
00:10:03,11 --> 00:10:07,118
is now the vectorial sum of all
these

167
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:10,081
dipole moments,
all these electrons going

168
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:14,23
around, means orbital dipole
moments, and you have to add

169
00:10:14,23 --> 00:10:17,786
these spin dipoles.
Some of these pair each other

170
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:20,083
out.
One electron would have its

171
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:24,75
dipole moment in this direction
and the other in this direction,

172
00:10:24,75 --> 00:10:27,269
and then the vectorial sum is
zero.

173
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:31,566
The net result is that most
atoms and molecules have dipole

174
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:35,493
moments which are either one
Bohr magneton or two Bohr

175
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:37,716
magnetons.
That is very common.

176
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:41,864
And that's what I will need
today to discuss with you how

177
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:47,071
strong a field
we can create if we align all

178
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:51,488
those magnetic dipoles.
The magnetic field that is

179
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:56,625
produced inside a material when
I expose it to an external

180
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:01,853
field, that magnetic field B is
the vacuum field that I can

181
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:07,171
create with a solenoid -- we
will discuss that further today

182
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:12,218
-- plus the field which I will
call B prime which is that

183
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:17,807
magnetic field that is the
result of the fact that

184
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,312
we're going to align these
dipoles.

185
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,775
The external field wants to
align these dipoles,

186
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,828
and the degree of success
depends on the strength of the

187
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:31,291
external field and of course on
the temperature.

188
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,123
If the temperature is low,
it's easier to align them,

189
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:37,997
because there is less thermal
agitation.

190
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:42,05
If, and that's a big if --
today you will see why it's a

191
00:11:42,05 --> 00:11:46,25
big if -- if B prime is linearly
proportional to B vacuum,

192
00:11:46,25 --> 00:11:49,86
if that is the case -- today
you

193
00:11:49,86 --> 00:11:54,995
will see that there are
situations where that's not the

194
00:11:54,995 --> 00:12:00,605
case -- then I can write down
that B prime equals xi of M --

195
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:06,595
we called that last lecture the
magnetic susceptibility -- times

196
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:09,923
B vacuum.
The linear proportionality

197
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:12,395
constant.
If I can do that,

198
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:17,72
then of course B is also
proportional to B vacuum because

199
00:12:17,72 --> 00:12:22,664
now I can write down that B is
one plus

200
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:26,787
xi M times B vacuum.
And that, for that we write

201
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:31,523
kappa of M times B vacuum,
which is the equation that I

202
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:35,383
started out with today.
And so that is only a

203
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:40,558
meaningful equation if the sum
of the alignment of all these

204
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:45,908
dipoles can be written as being
linearly proportional with the

205
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:49,505
external field.
And this is what I want to

206
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:55,186
explore today in more detail.
With paramagnetic material,

207
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:59,328
there is never any worry that
the linearity doesn't hold.

208
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:03,248
But with ferromagnetic
material, that is not the case,

209
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:07,464
because with ferromagnetic
material, it is relatively easy

210
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:11,31
to align these dipoles,
because they already group in

211
00:13:11,31 --> 00:13:15,6
domains, as we discussed last
time, and the domains flip in

212
00:13:15,6 --> 00:13:17,967
unison.
And so with ferromagnetic

213
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:22,627
material, as you will see today,
we can actually go into what we

214
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:25,924
call
saturation, that all the

215
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:29,029
dipoles are aligned in the same
direction.

216
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:33,194
And now the question is,
how strong would that field be?

217
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:37,207
I'm going to make a rough
calculation that gives you a

218
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:39,857
pretty good feeling for the
numbers.

219
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:42,583
It depends on what material you
have.

220
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,445
I will choose a material
whereby the magnetic dipole

221
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:50,837
moment is two Bohr magnetons,
so this is -- I told you it's

222
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:55,23
either one or two or three,
I pick one for

223
00:13:55,23 --> 00:13:58,85
which it is two.
And I have them all aligned.

224
00:13:58,85 --> 00:14:02,8
So I take the situation that
they're all aligned.

225
00:14:02,8 --> 00:14:06,668
So here is the current going
around the nucleus,

226
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:09,795
here's another one,
here's another one,

227
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:13,415
here's another one.
This is a solid material,

228
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:17,612
so these atoms or these
molecules are nicely packed.

229
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:21,48
And here we see all these
currents going around,

230
00:14:21,48 --> 00:14:27,404
and all these magnetic dipole
moments are nicely aligned.

231
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:31,086
And so these magnetic fields
are supporting each other.

232
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:34,495
And the question now is,
what is the magnetic field

233
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,677
inside here?
Well, that's an easy

234
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:40,359
calculation, because this really
looks like a solenoid,

235
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:43,836
like you have windings,
and you have a current going

236
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:45,472
around.
And you remember,

237
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:48,813
or should remember,
that if we have a solenoid and

238
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:52,767
we run a current through a
solenoid that the magnetic field

239
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:57,88
in the solenoid is mu zero --
this mu zero is not this mu,

240
00:14:57,88 --> 00:15:00,803
this mu zero is the same one
that -- oh no,

241
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:03,795
it's no- we don't have it on
the blackboard.

242
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:07,761
You know, that's the famous
four pi times ten to the minus

243
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:10,335
seven.
And then we have the current I,

244
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,258
and then we have N,
if that's the number of

245
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:17,224
windings that we have in the
solenoid, and then we have L,

246
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:19,659
which is the length of the
solenoid.

247
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:23,277
So this is the number of
windings of the solenoid per

248
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:26,408
unit length, the number of
windings per meter.

249
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:29,748
So if we could figure out,
with this arrangement,

250
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:32,743
what this
quantity is,

251
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:35,842
then we're in business.
I take a material,

252
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:39,999
which is not unreasonable,
whereby the number density of

253
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:44,383
atoms, I call that capital N,
written in the subscript way,

254
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,726
is about ten to the
twenty-nine.

255
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:50,883
So this is atoms or molecules,
whatever may be the case,

256
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,907
per cubic meter.
That's not unreasonable.

257
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:57,535
And now I have to somehow
manipulate, massage the

258
00:15:57,535 --> 00:16:02,373
mathematics, so that I get in
here this magnetic

259
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:06,405
moment, this Bohr magneton.
The two Bohr magnetons.

260
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:09,631
And there are several ways of
doing that.

261
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:13,421
I have chosen one way,
and that's the following.

262
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:16,083
I take here a length of one
meter.

263
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,954
So this is a solenoid,
and I take only one meter.

264
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:24,631
Could have taken three or five
meters, makes no difference.

265
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:28,18
I take one meter.
And each one of these loops

266
00:16:28,18 --> 00:16:31,164
here has an area A.
So we would agree,

267
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:36,127
I hope, that the area --
that the volume,

268
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:42,337
the volume of this solenoid --
this has a length one meter --

269
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:46,995
that that volume is A square
meters times one.

270
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:50,618
And so the volume is A cubic
meters.

271
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:54,241
A times one meter is A cubic
meters.

272
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:59,623
But the number of atoms per
cubic meter is ten to the

273
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:04,178
twenty-ninth,
and so the number of atoms that

274
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:08,587
I
have in this solenoid per meter

275
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:12,917
is this A times that N.
So this is the number of

276
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:18,352
windings, if I call this one
winding, the number of windings

277
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:21,669
per meter.
Or you can think of it the

278
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:26,368
number of atoms per meter,
the way they're lined up.

279
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:31,158
And so now I am in business,
because this now is my N

280
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:35,12
divided by L.
And so I can write now mu zero

281
00:17:35,12 --> 00:17:39,88
times
the current I times that area A

282
00:17:39,88 --> 00:17:43,764
times N, which is ten to the
twenty-nine.

283
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:47,842
But look now.
Now you see why I did it this

284
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:53,376
way, because I times A is the
magnetic dipole moment of my

285
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:55,998
atoms.
And that was two Bohr

286
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:59,882
magnetons.
And so this now also equals mu

287
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:02,989
zero times twice mu Bohr times
N.

288
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:09,105
And I'm finished,
because I know what mu zero is,

289
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:12,438
and I know what moo- mu Bohr is
-- we calculated that,

290
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:15,33
it's still here,
this number -- and I know what

291
00:18:15,33 --> 00:18:18,725
my capital subscript N is,
ten to the twenty-nine atoms

292
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:21,303
per cubic meter.
And so I just shove those

293
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:24,196
numbers in my equation,
and I find that this is

294
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:27,78
approximately two point three
tesla for the numbers that I

295
00:18:27,78 --> 00:18:30,483
have chosen.
It's not for all materials this

296
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:34,381
way, because I have adopted two
Bohr magnetons for the magnetic

297
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:38,028
dipole moment of each atom,
and I have adopted a density of

298
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:41,898
ten
to the twenty-nine atoms per

299
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:45,007
cubic meter.
And for that situation,

300
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:50,247
you get two point three tesla.
Now I want to use this number

301
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:54,954
and understand what's going to
happen in ferromagnetic

302
00:18:54,954 --> 00:18:58,329
material.
I take ferromagnetic material

303
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:03,391
and I expose it to an external
field, I call it the vacuum

304
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:06,678
field.
So I stick it in a solenoid and

305
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:11,568
I can choose the current
through my solenoid.

306
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:15,055
And I'm going to plot for you
the vacuum field.

307
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:19,299
This vacuum field is linearly
proportional to the current

308
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:22,785
through my solenoid.
This is an actual physical

309
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:24,528
solenoid.
I have a wire,

310
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:28,394
it goes around like this.
I don't have one here now.

311
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:30,895
And I run a current through
there.

312
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:35,518
And that vacuum B field equals
mu zero times I times N divided

313
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:39,838
by L, except that this N divided
by L is now the number of

314
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:45,012
windings of my current wire,
and this is the length of my

315
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:47,242
solenoid.
So don't confuse it with the

316
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:50,015
one we had there,
because that was on an atomic

317
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:52,426
scale and this is on a
macroscopic scale.

318
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:55,861
How many windings you have
could be -- where you had a big

319
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,754
one here in class,
twenty-eight hundred windings,

320
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:02,19
and we had sixty centimeters
long, and so that's what this

321
00:20:02,19 --> 00:20:05,204
number is all about.
So the moment that I know what

322
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,398
the current is through my
solenoid, I immediately know

323
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:11,05
what my vacuum field is.
There's a one-to-one

324
00:20:11,05 --> 00:20:13,642
correspondence.
And now I'm going to measure

325
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:17,365
inside
the ferromagnetic material,

326
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:21,889
which I stick in the solenoid.
I'm going to measure there the

327
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:25,358
magnetic field.
And what's going to happen now?

328
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:29,429
Well, first of all I cannot at
all plot this curve on a

329
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,973
one-to-one scale,
the reason being that kappa of

330
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:37,723
M for ferromagnetic material is
so large -- let us adopt for now

331
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:39,91
a number of one thousand,
say.

332
00:20:39,91 --> 00:20:41,945
Or it could be larger,
even.

333
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:46,055
Let's say kappa of M is one
thousand.

334
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:51,836
That means that if the magnetic
field in terms of a vector is

335
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:56,846
this big, one centimeter in the
length of the vector,

336
00:20:56,846 --> 00:21:01,856
that the field inside the
ferromagnetic material is a

337
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:06,674
thousand times higher.
If this is one centimeter in

338
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:11,01
length, a thousand times higher
is ten meters.

339
00:21:11,01 --> 00:21:15,538
So this is the length of the
vector

340
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:20,007
of the magnetic field inside
the ferromagnetic material.

341
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:22,77
That's why I cannot do it to
scale.

342
00:21:22,77 --> 00:21:27,563
So when I draw this line here,
keep in mind that if I did it

343
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:30,082
to scale, if I did,
but I can't,

344
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:33,738
then the tangent of alpha would
be kappa of M,

345
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:37,313
which in this case would be ten
to the third.

346
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:42,025
And so this angle alpha is
something like eighty-nine point

347
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:47,387
nine something degrees.
So I cannot do it to scale.

348
00:21:47,387 --> 00:21:50,903
Keep that in mind.
So in the beginning I get a

349
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:54,732
nice linear curve,
but now slowly I'm beginning to

350
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:58,091
reach saturation,
that all these dipoles are

351
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:02,076
going to be aligned,
and what you're going to see is

352
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:06,451
that this curve bends over and
bends over and bends over,

353
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:10,982
and the magnetic field that you
finally achieve here is the

354
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:15,357
famous two point three tesla,
which I calculated for that

355
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:17,936
imaginary material,
plus B vacuum.

356
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:22,077
The two point three is now the
field

357
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:25,977
which I will call B prime.
This is the field that is the

358
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,098
result of the alignment of all
those dipoles.

359
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,864
And so when I increase the
vacuum field,

360
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:35,907
this goes into saturation,
and settles for two point three

361
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:39,666
and can no longer increase,
because I have aligned all

362
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:43,425
these magnetic dipoles.
And so if your vacuum field is

363
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:47,325
this strong, then this field is
no longer thousand times

364
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:51,652
stronger than the vacuum field.
You're no longer in the linear

365
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:54,063
part.
So you could also think of it

366
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:57,647
as
kappa of M being smaller than a

367
00:22:57,647 --> 00:23:00,079
thousand.
Whichever way you prefer is

368
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,511
fine.
But it's no longer proportional

369
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:06,497
to the value of one thousand.
If the temperature is lower of

370
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,132
the material,
it's easier to align them,

371
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:11,97
and so you will achieve
saturation earlier,

372
00:23:11,97 --> 00:23:14,402
and so your curve would go like
this.

373
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:17,509
So the curve is also a function
of temperature.

374
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:21,36
So this is if the temperature
is low relative to this one.

375
00:23:21,36 --> 00:23:25,954
So these curves depend on,
on temperature as well.

376
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:30,615
The lower the temperature,
the easier it is to align them.

377
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:34,866
If I reach this point here,
when my B prime goes into

378
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:39,772
saturation, I can only increase
the field, the B field in the

379
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:43,042
material, by increasing the
vacuum field,

380
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:46,558
because B prime is not going to
go up again.

381
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,627
And so I can only get a higher
field by increasing this current

382
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:55,797
so that this B,
this B vacuum goes up.

383
00:23:55,797 --> 00:24:00,304
And that goes up very slowly,
because this huge magnification

384
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:02,858
factor of one thousand is gone
now.

385
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,887
So the slow,
it's very slow,

386
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:09,319
the growth, and that's why you
see that I drew it like this,

387
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:13,602
that it increases very slowly.
But my plot is not to scale

388
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:16,381
anyhow.
Now I want to discuss with you

389
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:20,588
what happens with the material
once I have driven it into

390
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:23,518
saturation.
What happens if now I change

391
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:28,704
the current and I make my vacuum
field zero again?

392
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:32,155
And now you get a very unusual
behavior.

393
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:35,429
Let me do that here on the
blackboard.

394
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:40,208
So I'll make a new drawing.
I could have continued with

395
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,305
that one, but let me make a new
one.

396
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:48,084
So I'm going to do the
following experiment in my head.

397
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:53,305
I have a solenoid and I run a
current through that solenoid.

398
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:58,526
And if the current is in
clockwise direction,

399
00:24:58,526 --> 00:25:01,154
my vacuum field will be in this
direction.

400
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:04,552
And when the current is in
counterclockwise direction,

401
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:08,078
I will assume that my vacuum
field is in this direction.

402
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:10,77
So there is ferromagnetic
material in here.

403
00:25:10,77 --> 00:25:13,527
If the current flows in
clockwise direction,

404
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:15,899
the vacuum field is in this
direction.

405
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:19,81
If I run it in counterclockwise
direction, the vacuum field is

406
00:25:19,81 --> 00:25:22,63
in that direction.
And here is going to be my

407
00:25:22,63 --> 00:25:25,323
vacuum field.
Easy for me to know what that

408
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,656
is, because if I know the
current

409
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:31,84
through my solenoid,
this equation will immediately

410
00:25:31,84 --> 00:25:33,877
tell me what the vacuum field
is.

411
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:37,06
So I have never any problems
with the vacuum field.

412
00:25:37,06 --> 00:25:40,562
I stick a probe in here and I
measure the magnetic field

413
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:43,808
inside that material.
How we do that is not so easy,

414
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,737
but we can do it.
There are a few things that I

415
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:48,965
can't tell you.
This is one of them.

416
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:52,085
So here is the magnetic field
inside the material.

417
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:55,713
All right, so there we start.
We do the same thing that we

418
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:59,47
did here.
So we approach the saturation.

419
00:25:59,47 --> 00:26:02,712
But now when I'm here,
I am reducing the current and

420
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,699
go back to zero.
Remember that when we are here,

421
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:09,069
all these domains that we
discussed last time have all

422
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,866
flipped in the direction of the
vacuum field.

423
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:15,362
So this field is enormous.
But now I make the current go

424
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:18,032
back to zero.
And what happens now is I end

425
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:21,465
up here, at this point P here.
The current now is zero.

426
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:24,389
There is no current going
through the solenoid.

427
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,36
Notice the vacuum field is
zero.

428
00:26:26,36 --> 00:26:31,127
I can take the material out,
the ferromagnetic material.

429
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:33,944
The material itself is now
magnetic.

430
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:37,726
And you see there is a magnetic
field inside it.

431
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:41,025
Why is that?
Because some of those domains

432
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:44,002
remain aligned,
so they don't go back.

433
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,381
And so we have created
permanent magnetism.

434
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:50,68
And so in the location,
at the location P,

435
00:26:50,68 --> 00:26:53,657
we have B vacuum is zero,
but B prime,

436
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:57,922
which is the result of those
aligned magnetic moments,

437
00:26:57,922 --> 00:27:02,106
is still in this direction.
Nothing is to scale here,

438
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:05,98
of course.
And so you still have a

439
00:27:05,98 --> 00:27:08,726
magnetic field.
Now I reverse the current.

440
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:11,94
I go counterclockwise.
So I'm creating a magnetic

441
00:27:11,94 --> 00:27:14,217
field vacuum now in this
direction.

442
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:17,097
And so now what will happen
with this curve?

443
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:19,307
I come up here.
And look now here,

444
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:21,852
at this location Q.
What do I have now?

445
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:25,87
I have something very bizarre.
I have now a situation whereby

446
00:27:25,87 --> 00:27:29,352
the vacuum field is in this
direction but there is no

447
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:31,629
magnetic field inside the
material.

448
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:35,246
The magnetic field inside is
zero.

449
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:39,367
So when we have point Q,
so we have B vacuum is in this

450
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,497
direction, but B inside,
B prime -- oh no,

451
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:44,328
it's not B prime,
it's B.

452
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:47,076
It's the total field inside,
is zero.

453
00:27:47,076 --> 00:27:51,351
The reason being that B prime
is still in this direction.

454
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:55,396
The reason being that the
domains are still aligned in

455
00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:58,678
this direction,
and so the vacuum field plus

456
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:02,113
the B prime field,
which has to be vectorially

457
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:06,234
added, adds up with a net field
zero.

458
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:07,999
Quite bizarre,
isn't it.

459
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:11,298
Now I increase the current,
but I keep going

460
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:14,75
counterclockwise,
and so the magnetic field of

461
00:28:14,75 --> 00:28:17,512
the vacuum remains in this
direction.

462
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:21,731
I go into saturation again,
in a similar way that I went

463
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:25,337
into saturation here.
And now I stop here -- OH,

464
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:29,94
I don't want to lose my brooch.
And now I stop here and I say

465
00:28:29,94 --> 00:28:32,778
to the current,
go back to zero again.

466
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,463
So my current now goes back to
zero.

467
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:39,273
There we go.
And now I arrive here,

468
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:41,68
point S.
And again, I have a situation

469
00:28:41,68 --> 00:28:45,453
that my vacuum field is zero.
I could take the material out

470
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:48,511
of the solenoid,
just walk around with it on the

471
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,918
street.
It will be a permanent magnet.

472
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:54,626
But now the magnetic field
inside this material in point P

473
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:57,684
it was in this direction.
If I take it out here,

474
00:28:57,684 --> 00:29:01,588
then it is in this direction.
Now some domains say aligned in

475
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:04,19
this direction.
The reason was that I had

476
00:29:04,19 --> 00:29:07,638
counterclockwise current,
and so those domains flipped

477
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:11,634
over.
And they're not all willing to

478
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:15,189
flip back again.
So I've also made a permanent

479
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:17,558
magnet here.
Vacuum field zero,

480
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:21,034
but B prime is now in the
opposite direction.

481
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:25,773
And then if I continue now to
go clockwise with current again

482
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:28,932
and increase the current,
I end up there.

483
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:33,277
And this is a bizarre curve.
We call this the hysteresis

484
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:35,804
curve.
If you look at this curve,

485
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:39,122
it's really amazing.
It's actually hard to,

486
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:43,567
to digest this.
You, you have to give it a

487
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:46,961
little bit of thought.
Because for one particular

488
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,718
value of the current,
for instance here,

489
00:29:49,718 --> 00:29:52,9
once I have a particular value
of the current,

490
00:29:52,9 --> 00:29:56,859
I know that B vacuum is a
given, I have two possibilities

491
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:00,607
here for the magnetic field.
And for the current here,

492
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:03,93
I have two possibilities for
the magnetic field.

493
00:30:03,93 --> 00:30:07,889
And so I cannot even know when
I take this material and I

494
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:14,514
expose it to an external field,
I can't even calculate what the

495
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:20,692
magnetic field inside will be.
It depends on the history of

496
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:25,379
this material.
Look at this point here and at

497
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:30,492
this point there.
If I asked you what is kappa of

498
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:34,965
M, *pff* it's almost a
ridiculous question.

499
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:40,717
Because what is kappa of M?
I have, um, I have a vacuum

500
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:44,371
field,
but I have no field inside.

501
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:46,944
So the field inside,
which is B, is zero,

502
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:49,002
and the vacuum field is not
zero.

503
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:51,832
So you would have to answer,
kappa M is zero.

504
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:54,084
That's the only thing you could
say.

505
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:55,37
Quite bizarre,
right.

506
00:30:55,37 --> 00:30:58,264
But right here,
there is a vacuum field but no

507
00:30:58,264 --> 00:31:00,837
field inside.
So kappa M is zero here and

508
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:03,024
kappa M is zero here.
And remember,

509
00:31:03,024 --> 00:31:06,047
here it was one thousand.
Look at the situation,

510
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:09,649
take this point of the curve
and this point of the curve.

511
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:12,093
Kappa M is less than zero,
is negative,

512
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:16,895
because here the vacuum
field is in this direction,

513
00:31:16,895 --> 00:31:19,991
but B prime is in that
direction, so they are in

514
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:23,088
opposite directions,
so the net field is in that

515
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:25,986
direction, but B vacuum is in
this direction.

516
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:29,807
And here it's also reversed.
So there's a bizarre situation

517
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:33,957
that you are effectively having
situations whereby kappa of M is

518
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:37,844
zero and kappa of M can also be
negative for those s- points

519
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:41,006
that I have there.
I can show you this hysteresis

520
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:45,946
curve, and I do it exactly the
way that I explained to you,

521
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:50,591
except that I will not be able
to run this current very slowly

522
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:53,332
up and down.
I do it with sixty hertz

523
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:56,605
alternating current,
just get it out of the,

524
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:59,194
the wall.
And so I run through this

525
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:02,468
solenoid n- sixty hertz
alternating current.

526
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:06,731
That means we go through this
curve very quickly back and

527
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:09,168
forth.
Between this point maximum

528
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:12,061
current and this point maximum
current.

529
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:17,009
The current clockwise
counterclockwise clockwise

530
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:20,25
counterclockwise,
and we change that sixty times

531
00:32:20,25 --> 00:32:23,008
per second.
And then I will show you this

532
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,076
curve, again,
highly distorted.

533
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,523
I cannot plot it one-to-one,
for the reasons that I

534
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:31,419
explained to you.
And you will see then the

535
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:34,521
hysteresis curve.
That's called the hysteresis

536
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,831
curve.
And for that,

537
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:39,899
I have to do several things.
And I always forget what I have

538
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,553
to do, but just don't worry
about it, I will find out.

539
00:32:43,553 --> 00:32:46,449
My TV goes on.
This light goes off and this

540
00:32:46,449 --> 00:32:50,723
light goes off.
Look there on the screen,

541
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:55,03
and you will see within seconds
there is the hysteresis curve.

542
00:32:55,03 --> 00:32:58,489
And as I said to you earlier,
I cannot start here,

543
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:01,454
unfortunately,
because we switch it so fast

544
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:05,266
back and forth that this part of
the curve, by the way,

545
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:08,513
which is called the virginal
curve -- virginal,

546
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:10,842
because it's once and never
again.

547
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:14,584
Once you have reached that
point, from that moment on,

548
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:18,537
you always stick to this -- I
know, you should know about

549
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:19,666
that.
[laughter].

550
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:24,963
And so here you see a striking
example of a hysteresis curve.

551
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:27,658
And so you can ask yourself now
the question,

552
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:30,107
can we make this material
virginal again?

553
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:33,598
And then the answer is yes.
There are various ways you can

554
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,864
do that.
One way is you could take the

555
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:38,498
material out,
so that means you take it out,

556
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:41,193
for instance,
when there is remnant magnetism

557
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:44,316
here, so it's a magnet,
and now you heat it up above

558
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,827
the Curie point,
as we did last time in my

559
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:49,951
lecture, and then the domains
completely fall apart,

560
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:54,176
and then you cool it again
below the Curie point,

561
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,212
and then it is virginal
material again.

562
00:33:56,212 --> 00:33:58,088
And then you could start here
again.

563
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:01,356
That's one way you could do it.
There is another way you could

564
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,66
try to do it.
You take a hammer and you just

565
00:34:03,66 --> 00:34:05,91
bang on it.
So you take it out and you have

566
00:34:05,91 --> 00:34:08,106
permanent magnetism,
either here or there,

567
00:34:08,106 --> 00:34:10,517
and you bang on it,
and you hope for the best.

568
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:12,5
And maybe you can get it back
to here.

569
00:34:12,5 --> 00:34:15,232
There is another way,
which we call demagnetization,

570
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:18,393
and I think that's what happens
when you steal a book in the

571
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:21,768
library and you try to get away
with it, and the alarm goes off.

572
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:26,243
Someone hasn't demagnetized the
magnetic strip in the book.

573
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:28,938
You may have noticed that when
you take it out,

574
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:31,457
that someone under the table
goes like this.

575
00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:34,855
And what they are doing then is
they are demagnetizing that

576
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:36,905
strip.
And the way you do that is as

577
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:39,132
follows.
Here the current goes back and

578
00:34:39,132 --> 00:34:41,416
forth between this value and
this value.

579
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:45,048
That means the vacuum and I are
directly coupled to each other.

580
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,099
So I think of this as being
current.

581
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,555
And now I go up to here and
then back and then here and here

582
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:54,129
and here and here and here and
here and here and here and here

583
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:57,062
and
I end up there again.

584
00:34:57,062 --> 00:35:00,769
And I can show you that.
So again you have alternating

585
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:04,755
current, but the amplitude of
the current you decrease and

586
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:08,252
decrease and decrease,
and you're going to see that

587
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:10,56
there.
And you see that I can turn

588
00:35:10,56 --> 00:35:13,986
this material -- see the
hysteresis curve changes.

589
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,273
So the amplitude of the current
is not as large,

590
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:20,63
so the amplitude of the B
vacuum is not as large,

591
00:35:20,63 --> 00:35:24,127
and I slowly go back.
And I can change a non-virgin

592
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:30,268
back into a virgin.
And that's the way we do it as

593
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:33,466
physicists.
Demagnetization.

594
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:37,138
Did I turn that off?
Yes, I did.

595
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,626
I have here a,
a coil.

596
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:45,075
You can't see that there is a
coil inside here,

597
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:49,813
but there is.
I can, uh, power this coil,

598
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:57,512
putting a current through it.
Ferromagnetic material,

599
00:35:57,512 --> 00:36:01,226
I don't know what kappa is,
but, uh, at least a thousand.

600
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,143
I get an enormously strong
field inside here.

601
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:08,055
And this field is so strong
that this piece of ferromagnetic

602
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:11,436
material will be attracted.
The field is non-uniform

603
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,956
outside.
We discussed last time that it

604
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:16,21
will go clunk,
it will stick there.

605
00:36:16,21 --> 00:36:19,26
So let's do that.
So I power this electromagnet

606
00:36:19,26 --> 00:36:22,973
-- you can't see that I did,
you have to take my word for

607
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,692
it, but you believe it now.
There it goes.

608
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:28,012
Oh boy.
The force is so large that I

609
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:31,791
would ask two people to come and
see

610
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:35,487
whether they can pull it apart.
The force that the two are

611
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:39,442
together is so large that you
may not even be able to separate

612
00:36:39,442 --> 00:36:41,517
it.
Do we have two strong people?

613
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:43,591
One strong woman,
one strong man.

614
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:46,055
You look very strong to me.
[laughter].

615
00:36:46,055 --> 00:36:48,454
Come on.
It's not going to be a tug of

616
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:51,436
war between the two of you.
That's not my plan.

617
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:54,16
Be very careful,
because if you touch this,

618
00:36:54,16 --> 00:36:56,623
you get electrocuted.
So don't do that.

619
00:36:56,623 --> 00:36:59,346
[laughter].
But make sure that everyone can

620
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:02,789
see you.
Because there is a current

621
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:05,132
running through this solenoid
now, yeah?

622
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:06,814
OK.
Now just in case that you

623
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:09,037
succeed, I don't want you to get
hurt.

624
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:11,44
Student: OK.
So make sure that you secure

625
00:37:11,44 --> 00:37:12,641
yourself.
[laughter].

626
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:16,186
Because suppose the current
stopped running all of a sudden.

627
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:18,589
It's possible,
it's MIT [laughter] right,

628
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:20,872
anything could happen.
Then, of course,

629
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:24,416
it's no longer a strong magnet.
It's only a strong magnet as

630
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:27,48
long as the current is running
through the solenoid.

631
00:37:27,48 --> 00:37:30,664
So you secure yourself too.
OK, three two one zero go.

632
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:32,046
[laughter].
Don't worry.

633
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:35,504
I knew
that in advance.

634
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:38,862
But thank you very much.
[laughter].

635
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:41,548
Very kind of you.
[applause].

636
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:45,77
Now comes something that you
will understand.

637
00:37:45,77 --> 00:37:51,431
If I make the current go to
zero, then the vacuum field goes

638
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:54,885
to zero.
That means the field that is

639
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:58,531
generated by the solenoid goes
to zero.

640
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:02,753
I will do that now in front of
your own eyes.

641
00:38:02,753 --> 00:38:06,494
No more current,
right?

642
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,813
Why is this still hanging
there?

643
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:10,982
Yeah?
The solenoid [inaudible]

644
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:13,45
magnetize the ferrous
[inaudible].

645
00:38:13,45 --> 00:38:16,292
You hear?
You've taken the vacuum field

646
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:19,957
out, but the domains to a
certain degree are still

647
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:23,622
aligned, and so the whole thing
is still a magnet.

648
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:28,184
Not as strong as magnet -- if I
were to invite you to come now

649
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:30,279
and take it apart,
you could.

650
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:33,345
But it still takes sub-
substantial force.

651
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:38,218
And I will show you how
large that force is.

652
00:38:38,218 --> 00:38:42,895
I'm going to load it down now.
There's now one kilogram

653
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:46,705
hanging on it.
Ooh, let me make sure I secure

654
00:38:46,705 --> 00:38:50,602
that, otherwise I can get killed
for a change.

655
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:54,066
OK, three kilograms is hanging
on it now.

656
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:57,097
Five kilograms is hanging on it
now.

657
00:38:57,097 --> 00:39:00,214
Seven kilograms is hanging on
it now.

658
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:03,245
Nine kilograms is hanging on it
now.

659
00:39:03,245 --> 00:39:08,182
Oh boy, we may never make it.
Ten kilograms is -- there it

660
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:11,213
goes.
[laughter].

661
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:15,909
Ten kilograms.
Now the show is not over yet.

662
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:21,808
What is very interesting,
and I want you to think about

663
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:27,925
it, that if now I take these two
pieces of -- [laughter].

664
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:33,605
If I take these two pieces of
ferromagnetic material,

665
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:37,1
that -- nothing.
Do you know why?

666
00:39:37,1 --> 00:39:42,452
I dropped it on the floor.
[laughter].

667
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:45,109
That's really why.
I dropped it on the floor,

668
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:47,584
and that is like banging it
with a hammer,

669
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:50,964
and then the domains go away.
Had I not dropped it on the

670
00:39:50,964 --> 00:39:53,862
floor [laughter],
there would have been something

671
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:57,061
left, but very little,
which is interesting by itself.

672
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,899
The shock of the separation,
when that happened,

673
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,495
already makes many of the
domains flip back,

674
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:04,607
and there would be very little
left.

675
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:08,109
Not enough to carry this weight
anymore, but that's largely

676
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:10,101
because I dropped it on the
floor.

677
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:13,481
I did that purposely so you can
see

678
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:17,56
when you drop [laughter] things
on the floor.

679
00:40:17,56 --> 00:40:22,472
If I bring ferromagnetic
material in the vicinity of a

680
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:27,014
magnet, I change the magnetic
field configuration,

681
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:30,536
and that's very easy to
understand now.

682
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:35,356
Suppose I have here a magnet,
north pole, south pole,

683
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:40,176
and the magnetic field,
magnetic dipole field is sort

684
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:44,254
of like this.
And now I bring in the vicinity

685
00:40:44,254 --> 00:40:47,583
here
a piece of ferromagnetic

686
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,347
material.
Could be a wrench.

687
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:53,266
What happens now is that this
ferromagnetic material will see

688
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:56,663
this vacuum field -- this is
called the vacuum field,

689
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,929
is an external field.
And so these domains in there

690
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:03,653
trying to align a little bit.
Degree of success depends on

691
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:06,984
how strong the field is,
depends on the temperature,

692
00:41:06,984 --> 00:41:09,532
depends on the kappa M of that
material.

693
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:12,863
But certainly this will become
sort of a south pole,

694
00:41:12,863 --> 00:41:16,456
this will become a north pole.
That's the way that these

695
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:20,11
dipoles
are going to align themselves.

696
00:41:20,11 --> 00:41:23,261
They are going to create
themselves a field in this

697
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:25,719
direction.
They're going to support that

698
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,925
field.
And so the net result is that

699
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:30,509
the field inside here becomes
very strong.

700
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:34,353
And so what happens with these
field lines, they go like this.

701
00:41:34,353 --> 00:41:37,694
They're being sucked into this
ferromagnetic material.

702
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:40,34
It's very hard to know exactly
how they go.

703
00:41:40,34 --> 00:41:44,059
And the field here will weaken.
And I'm going to demonstrate

704
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:46,643
that to you.
This is actually very easy to

705
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:50,816
demonstrate.
And the way I'm going to

706
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:56,388
demonstrate that is as follows.
I have there a setup whereby we

707
00:41:56,388 --> 00:42:01,42
have a, a magnet and we have a
nail and we have a strong.

708
00:42:01,42 --> 00:42:04,835
And the nail wants to go to the
magnet.

709
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:09,418
The mail its- the nail itself
is, uh, ferromagnetic.

710
00:42:09,418 --> 00:42:13,551
So the nail would love to go in
this direction,

711
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:16,696
but it can't.
So it just sits there,

712
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:21,099
hangs there in space.
First of all,

713
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:25,018
what I want to show you is that
if I bring paramagnetic material

714
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:27,505
in the vicinity,
that that magnetic field

715
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:30,49
configuration here is not going
to change at all.

716
00:42:30,49 --> 00:42:34,097
Paramagnetic material has a
kappa of M so close to one that

717
00:42:34,097 --> 00:42:37,456
nothing is going to happen.
But the moment that I bring

718
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:39,695
ferromagnetic material,
for instance,

719
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:42,618
here, then you get a field
configuration change,

720
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:46,349
and if I do that just the right
way, then the nail will fall.

721
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:49,023
In other words,
there is not enough magnetic

722
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:53,626
field here in order to hold the
nail in that direction.

723
00:42:53,626 --> 00:42:58,14
And I'm going to show that for
you, to you there.

724
00:42:58,14 --> 00:43:02,937
Need some power here,
I believe, and we have to make

725
00:43:02,937 --> 00:43:06,981
it dark here.
I'm going to shadow project it

726
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:10,461
for you.
And the shadow projection you

727
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:15,446
will see coming up very shortly.
This is a carbon arc.

728
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:20,055
You have to give it a little
bit of time to start.

729
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:26,074
There is the carbon arc.
So there you see the nail.

730
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:29,936
And here you see the magnet.
You see that?

731
00:43:29,936 --> 00:43:33,797
That's exactly the way I drew
the picture.

732
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:38,506
And here, you hav- I have here
a piece of aluminum,

733
00:43:38,506 --> 00:43:43,31
which is, paramagnetic.
I can bring that through the

734
00:43:43,31 --> 00:43:45,853
field here.
Nothing happens.

735
00:43:45,853 --> 00:43:50,185
My hands, believe it or not,
are definitely not

736
00:43:50,185 --> 00:43:54,141
ferromagnetic,
so I can also bring my hands

737
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:55,365
here.
Nothing.

738
00:43:55,365 --> 00:43:59,29
Nothing.
So magnetic fields is not

739
00:43:59,29 --> 00:44:01,802
disturbed in any way,
in any serious way,

740
00:44:01,802 --> 00:44:04,377
either by paramagnetic
material, aluminum,

741
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:06,513
or my hands,
which I think are also

742
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,397
paramagnetic,
but I'm not sure.

743
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:11,663
I'm not sure whether I'm
diamagnetic or paramagnetic,

744
00:44:11,663 --> 00:44:14,803
but it doesn't make any
difference, because in both

745
00:44:14,803 --> 00:44:18,446
cases there is no significant
change of the magnetic field.

746
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:21,712
But now I have a wrench here.
Here, there's a wrench.

747
00:44:21,712 --> 00:44:23,094
You see it?
[laughter].

748
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,104
OK.
And now I'll bring the wrench

749
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:30,474
close to that magnet.
My major worry is that magnetic

750
00:44:30,474 --> 00:44:35,899
field is so strong that once the
wrench go- there's no way I can

751
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:39,86
get it off again.
So I get only one shot at it.

752
00:44:39,86 --> 00:44:44,425
And there goes the nail.
So what I -- what you saw now

753
00:44:44,425 --> 00:44:49,333
in front of your eyes is that I
changed the magnetic field

754
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:54,758
configuration in such a way that
the field was not strong enough

755
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,945
to pull in the,
the nail.

756
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:03,928
Now comes an important
question, a big moment in our

757
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:05,923
life.
And that is,

758
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:12,376
what now is the effect of
magnetic material on Maxwell's

759
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,365
equations?
And let's take a look at

760
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:21,293
Maxwell's equations.
Here we have Maxwell's

761
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:26,221
equations the way we know them.
[laughter].

762
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:31,853
And let's first look at number
one.

763
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:35,044
That's Gauss's Law.
Gauss's Law says that the

764
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:39,541
closed surface integral of E dot
DA -- that's the electric flux

765
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:44,038
through a closed surface -- E is
equal to all the charge inside

766
00:45:44,038 --> 00:45:47,882
divided by epsilon zero,
but you have to allow for the

767
00:45:47,882 --> 00:45:51,074
kappa, for the electric,
dielectric constant.

768
00:45:51,074 --> 00:45:54,845
The kappa, by the way,
always lowers the field inside

769
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:58,182
the material when we deal with
electric fields.

770
00:45:58,182 --> 00:46:01,809
It never increases it like
magnetic

771
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:03,489
fields.
It always lowers it.

772
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:06,164
Kappa is normally a few --
except for water,

773
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:08,031
it is eighty,
it's quite large,

774
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:11,765
and there are some ridiculous
substances whereby kappa can be

775
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:15,312
as large as three hundred.
I think strontium titanate -- I

776
00:46:15,312 --> 00:46:18,921
just looked it up this morning
-- has a ridiculous value of

777
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:21,721
kappa of three hundred.
So that's Gauss's Law.

778
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:24,894
Nothing's going to change there
as far as I can see.

779
00:46:24,894 --> 00:46:26,823
And then we have the second
one.

780
00:46:26,823 --> 00:46:31,242
The closed surface integral of
B dot DL equals zero.

781
00:46:31,242 --> 00:46:33,039
Oh, it says an,
it says an L.

782
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,57
That shouldn't even be an L.
Ho, I hope you caught that.

783
00:46:36,57 --> 00:46:38,047
This is an A,
of course.

784
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:40,487
How could I?
This is the closed surface

785
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:44,339
integral of B dot DA is zero.
What this is telling me is that

786
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,1
magnetic ma- magnetic monopoles
don't exist.

787
00:46:47,1 --> 00:46:49,283
At least we think they don't
exist.

788
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:52,557
Don't think that people are not
trying to find them.

789
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:56,088
And if you find a magnetic
monopole, and if you put that

790
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:58,4
inside a box,
then the closed surface

791
00:46:58,4 --> 00:47:02,702
integral of the magnetic flux
through that box

792
00:47:02,702 --> 00:47:06,248
would not be zero.
And so then this is not true.

793
00:47:06,248 --> 00:47:09,191
But as far as we know,
it's always true,

794
00:47:09,191 --> 00:47:13,643
because we don't think that
magnetic poles- monopoles exist.

795
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:16,661
And so then we come to the
Faraday's Law.

796
00:47:16,661 --> 00:47:21,113
Faraday's Law runs our economy.
Faraday's Law tells you when

797
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:25,565
you move conducting loops in
magnetic fields that you create

798
00:47:25,565 --> 00:47:28,81
electricity.
This equation runs our economy.

799
00:47:28,81 --> 00:47:33,338
And now we come -- none of
these, by the way,

800
00:47:33,338 --> 00:47:36,772
require any adjustment in terms
of kappa of M.

801
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:39,138
But now we come to Ampere's
Law.

802
00:47:39,138 --> 00:47:42,267
Ampere's Law,
which was amended by Maxwell

803
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:45,625
himself, tells me what the
magnetic field is,

804
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,372
and all these results are for
vacuum.

805
00:47:48,372 --> 00:47:51,73
But now we know that that's not
true anymore.

806
00:47:51,73 --> 00:47:56,004
So this has to be adjusted now
by a factor of kappa of M,

807
00:47:56,004 --> 00:47:58,599
which is the relative
permeability.

808
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:02,72
And kappa of M is perfectly
kosher for paramagnetic and

809
00:48:02,72 --> 00:48:05,69
diamagnetic
materials.

810
00:48:05,69 --> 00:48:07,798
There's never any problem
there.

811
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:10,722
So here it comes.
For diamagnetic materials,

812
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:14,462
it's a little less than one.
For paramagnetic materials,

813
00:48:14,462 --> 00:48:17,59
a little larger than one.
But when we deal with

814
00:48:17,59 --> 00:48:21,126
ferromagnetic materials,
you have to be very careful,

815
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:24,73
because we have seen today this
hysteresis phenomenon,

816
00:48:24,73 --> 00:48:28,878
that there are even situations
whereby kappa of M is negative,

817
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:32,278
whereby kappa M is zero,
and whereby kappa M can be

818
00:48:32,278 --> 00:48:37,583
huge, can be ten to the third.
So there you have to be very,

819
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:43,43
very careful when you apply
this equation without thinking.

820
00:48:43,43 --> 00:48:49,277
Maxwell's equations are so
important that I'm sure you want

821
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:54,115
to see more of them.
So you see them there again.

822
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:58,047
And maybe that's not enough.
[laughter].

823
00:48:58,047 --> 00:49:01,979
Maybe you want to see even more
of them.

824
00:49:01,979 --> 00:49:04,801
So look at them.
Inhale them.

825
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:09,099
Let them penetrate your
brains.

826
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:13,108
[laughter].
I don't care in which direction

827
00:49:13,108 --> 00:49:16,83
you look now.
It's hard not to see them.

828
00:49:16,83 --> 00:49:21,889
Today is therefore very
special, because today we have

829
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:25,421
all four Maxwell's equations in
place.

830
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:30,671
And this was one of the main
objectives of eight oh two.

831
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:36,207
So we have completed the long
journey, and on April five we

832
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:41,956
have reached the summit.
Now I realize that the view is

833
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:46,341
not spectacular for all of you
yet, because often at the summit

834
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:49,241
there is some fog.
But the fog will clear.

835
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:53,13
And I can assure you that from
here on on, it's climbing

836
00:49:53,13 --> 00:49:55,747
downhill.
I think this moment is worth

837
00:49:55,747 --> 00:49:59,99
celebrating, and therefore I
bought six hundred daffodils for

838
00:49:59,99 --> 00:50:01,758
this occasion.
[laughter].

839
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:06,072
And I would like you to come at
the, at the end of the lecture

840
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:09,821
and pick up one of these
daffodils and take it back to

841
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:14,034
your dormitory.
I don't know whether I have

842
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:18,419
enough for all these high school
students and all their parents,

843
00:50:18,419 --> 00:50:20,299
but why not,
give it a shot,

844
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:23,362
and take one.
And when you look at it tonight

845
00:50:23,362 --> 00:50:26,912
at home and tomorrow,
remember that you only once in

846
00:50:26,912 --> 00:50:30,74
your life go through this
experience, that for the first

847
00:50:30,74 --> 00:50:34,221
time you see all four Maxwell's
equations complete,

848
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:38,05
all of it, and that you're
capable of appreciating them,

849
00:50:38,05 --> 00:50:41,6
at least in principle.
This will never happen again.

850
00:50:41,6 --> 00:50:45,071
You will never be the
same.

851
00:50:45,071 --> 00:50:50,665
[laughter].
To put it in simple terms,

852
00:50:50,665 --> 00:50:58,679
as far as eight oh two is
concerned, you are no longer

853
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:04,425
unspoiled virginal material
[laughter].

854
00:51:04,425 --> 00:51:10,171
You've lost your virginity.
[laughter].

855
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:14,254
Congratulations!
[laughter].

856
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:20
[applause].
[crowd noise].

857
00:51:20 --> 00:51:38,666
[crowd noise].
[crowd noise].

858
00:51:38,666 --> 00:52:00
[crowd noise].
[crowd noise].

859
00:52:00 --> 00:52:18,666
[crowd noise].
[crowd noise].

860
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:40
[crowd noise].
[crowd noise].

861
00:52:40 --> 00:52:58,666
[crowd noise].
[crowd noise].

862
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:20
[crowd noise].
[crowd noise].

863
00:53:20 --> 00:53:38,671
[crowd noise].
[crowd noise].

864
00:53:38,671 --> 53:44
[crowd noise].
[crowd noise].
