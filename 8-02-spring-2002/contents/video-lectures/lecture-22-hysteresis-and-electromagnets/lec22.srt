1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
When I expose material to an
external magnetic field,

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
then we learned last time that
the field inside that material

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
is modified.
And we expressed that in terms

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
of an equation,
that the field inside the

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:24
material is kappa of M,
which is called the relative

6
00:00:22 --> 00:00:28
permeability,
times the external field,

7
00:00:26 --> 00:00:32
and I will refer to that all
the

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:36
time as the vacuum field.
And when we have diamagnetic

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
material, kappa M is just a hair
smaller than one;

10
00:00:37 --> 00:00:43
with paramagnetic material,
it is a hair larger than one;

11
00:00:41 --> 00:00:47
but when we have ferromagnetic
material it can be huge.

12
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
It can be thousands,
10 thousands,

13
00:00:48 --> 00:00:54
and even higher.
Now in the case of para- and

14
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
ferromagnetic material,
the kappa of M is the result of

15
00:00:55 --> 00:01:01
the fact that the intrinsic
dipoles of the atoms and the

16
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
molecules are
going to be aligned by the

17
00:01:03 --> 00:01:09
external field.
And today I want to raise the

18
00:01:06 --> 00:01:12
question, how large can the
magnetic dipole moment of a

19
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
single atom be?
And then comes the logical

20
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
question, how strong can we
actually, then,

21
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
have a field inside
ferromagnetic material?

22
00:01:20 --> 00:01:26
That means if we were able to
align all the dipole moments of

23
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
all the atoms,
what is the maximum that we can

24
00:01:27 --> 00:01:33
achieve?
To calculate the magnetic

25
00:01:30 --> 00:01:36
dipole
moment of an atom,

26
00:01:33 --> 00:01:39
you have to do some quantum
mechanics, and that's beyond the

27
00:01:37 --> 00:01:43
scope of this course.
And so I will derive it in a

28
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
classical way,
and then at the very end I will

29
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
add a little pepper and salt,
which is quantum mechanics,

30
00:01:46 --> 00:01:52
just to make the result right.
But it can be done in a

31
00:01:50 --> 00:01:56
classical way,
and it can give you a very

32
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
good, good idea.
If I have a hydrogen atom,

33
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
which has a proton at the
center, has a charge plus e -- e

34
00:01:59 --> 00:02:05
is the charge of the electron
but this is the plus charge.

35
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
And let this have an orbit
R, circular orbit.

36
00:02:07 --> 00:02:13
And the electron here e,
I'll give it the minus sign to

37
00:02:10 --> 00:02:16
make sure that you know that
it's negative.

38
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
Say the electron goes around in
this direction.

39
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
This is the velocity of the
electron.

40
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
That means that of course the
current around the proton would

41
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
then be in this direction.
If an electron goes like this,

42
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
the current goes like that,
that's just by convention.

43
00:02:31 --> 00:02:37
The mass of an electron -- you
should know that by now -- is

44
00:02:35 --> 00:02:41
approximately 9.1
times 10 to the

45
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
-31 kilograms.
The charge of the electron,

46
00:02:44 --> 00:02:50
1.6 times 10 to the
-19 coulombs.

47
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
And the radius of the orbit in
a hydrogen atom -- it's often

48
00:02:52 --> 00:02:58
called the Bohr radius,
by the way -- is approximately

49
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
5 times 10 to the 
-11 meters.

50
00:02:59 --> 00:03:05
We're going to need these
numbers.

51
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
That's why I write them down
for you.

52
00:03:05 --> 00:03:11
If you look at this current
running around the proton,

53
00:03:10 --> 00:03:16
it's really a current which the
current, say,

54
00:03:13 --> 00:03:19
goes in this direction.
And here is that proton --

55
00:03:17 --> 00:03:23
trying to make you see three
dimensionally.

56
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
Then it creates a magnetic
field in this direction,

57
00:03:24 --> 00:03:30
and so the magnetic dipole
moment mu is up.

58
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
And the magnitude of that
magnetic dipole moment,

59
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
as we learned last time,
is simply this current I times

60
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
the area A of this current loop.
Now the area A is trivial

61
00:03:40 --> 00:03:46
to calculate.
That's pi R square,

62
00:03:43 --> 00:03:49
R being the radius of the
orbit.

63
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
And so A, that's the easiest,
is pi R squared.

64
00:03:50 --> 00:03:56
And if I use my 5 times 10
to the minus 11,

65
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
then I find that this area is
8 times 10 to the 

66
00:03:59 --> 00:04:05
-21 square meters.
So that's easy.

67
00:04:02 --> 00:04:08
But now comes the question,
what is I?

68
00:04:06 --> 00:04:12
What is the current?
So now we have to do a

69
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
little bit more work.
And we have to combine our

70
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
knowledge of,
uh 8.02 with our

71
00:04:17 --> 00:04:23
knowledge of 8.01.
If this electron goes around,

72
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
the reason why it goes around
is that the proton and the

73
00:04:24 --> 00:04:30
electron attract each other.
And so there is a force in this

74
00:04:28 --> 00:04:34
direction.
And we know that force,

75
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
that's the Coulomb force.
It's an electric force.

76
00:04:34 --> 00:04:40
That force is this charge times
this charge, so that's e

77
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
squared, divided by our famous
4 pi

78
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
epsilon 0,
and then we have to divide it

79
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
by the radius squared.
So that's Coulomb's Law.

80
00:04:49 --> 00:04:55
But from 8.01,
from Newtonian mechanics,

81
00:04:52 --> 00:04:58
we know that this is what we
call the centripetal force that

82
00:04:57 --> 00:05:03
holds it in orbit,
so to speak,

83
00:04:59 --> 00:05:05
and that is M V squared,
M being the mass of the

84
00:05:02 --> 00:05:08
electron, V being the speed of
the electron,

85
00:05:06 --> 00:05:12
and V squared divided by R.
And so this allows me to

86
00:05:10 --> 00:05:16
calculate
as a first step,

87
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
before we get into the current,
what the velocity of this

88
00:05:17 --> 00:05:23
electron is.
It's phenomenal.

89
00:05:20 --> 00:05:26
It's an incredible speed.
So V then becomes -- I lose one

90
00:05:24 --> 00:05:30
R -- so I get the square root,
I get an e squared upstairs

91
00:05:29 --> 00:05:35
here, my M goes downstairs,
I have 4 pi epsilon 0,

92
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
and I have here an R.
And I know all these numbers.

93
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
I know what e is,
I know what capital R is,

94
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
I know what 4 pi epsilon
0 is --

95
00:05:45 --> 00:05:51
one over 4 pi epsilon 0
is the famous 9 to the power

96
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
-- 9 times 10 to the power
9.

97
00:05:52 --> 00:05:58
And so I can calculate what V
is.

98
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
And if I stick in the numbers
and if I did not make a mistake,

99
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
then I find about 2.3 times 10 to the 6

100
00:06:02 --> 00:06:08
meters per second.
It's an immensely high speed,

101
00:06:05 --> 00:06:11
5 million miles per hour.
If this were a straight line,

102
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
you would make it to the moon
in three minutes.

103
00:06:13 --> 00:06:19
5 million miles per hour
this electron goes around the

104
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
proton.
Now I have to go to the

105
00:06:20 --> 00:06:26
current.
I have to find out what the

106
00:06:22 --> 00:06:28
current is.
So the question that I'm going

107
00:06:24 --> 00:06:30
to ask now is how long does it
take for this electron to go

108
00:06:28 --> 00:06:34
around.
Well, that time,

109
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
capital T, is of course the
circumference of my circle

110
00:06:32 --> 00:06:38
divided by the speed of the
electron.

111
00:06:35 --> 00:06:41
Trivial.
Even the high school students

112
00:06:37 --> 00:06:43
in my audience will understand
that one, I hope.

113
00:06:40 --> 00:06:46
And so I know what 2 pi R is,
because I know R and I know V

114
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
and so I can calculate that
time, just by sticking in the

115
00:06:47 --> 00:06:53
numbers.
And I find that it is about 1.14

116
00:06:50 --> 00:06:56
times 10 to the
-16 seconds.

117
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
Just imagine how small that
time is.

118
00:06:57 --> 00:07:03
You cannot even -- we cannot
even imagine what it's like.

119
00:07:02 --> 00:07:08
It goes 10 to the 16
times per second around,

120
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
because it has this huge speed.
The 1.14 times

121
00:07:10 --> 00:07:16
10 to the -16 really
should have been 1.4

122
00:07:15 --> 00:07:21
times 10 to the -16.
Of course, it doesn't make much

123
00:07:20 --> 00:07:26
difference, but in case you
substitute in the

124
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
numbers, it is 1.4
times 10 to the -16.

125
00:07:29 --> 00:07:35
Now, we still haven't found the
current, but we're almost there.

126
00:07:34 --> 00:07:40
Because when you look here,
there is this electron going

127
00:07:38 --> 00:07:44
by, and every 1.14
10 to the -16

128
00:07:42 --> 00:07:48
seconds, that electron goes by.
So the current I,

129
00:07:46 --> 00:07:52
that's the definition of
current, is the charge per unit

130
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
time.
And so every capital T seconds,

131
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
the charge e goes by,
and so this is

132
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
per definition the current.
And so this current,

133
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
then, that you have,
which is simply due to the

134
00:08:04 --> 00:08:10
electron going around the
proton, is about 1.1

135
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
times 10 to the -3
amperes.

136
00:08:12 --> 00:08:18
And that is mind-boggling.
A milliampere.

137
00:08:15 --> 00:08:21
One electron going around a
proton represents a current of a

138
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
milliampere.
And now of course I have the

139
00:08:23 --> 00:08:29
magnetic moment mu,
that is I times A.

140
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
We already calculated A,
and now we also have the

141
00:08:31 --> 00:08:37
current I, and so we now get
that mu is approximately 

142
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
9.3, if you put in all
the decimals correctly,

143
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
times 10 to the 
-24, and the unit is of

144
00:08:44 --> 00:08:50
course amperes square meters.
This is area,

145
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
and this is current.
This A has nothing to do with

146
00:08:51 --> 00:08:57
that A, hey.
This is amperes.

147
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
Be careful.
And this is square meters.

148
00:08:56 --> 00:09:02
But these are the units.
And this has a name.

149
00:08:59 --> 00:09:05
This is called the Bohr
magneton.

150
00:09:03 --> 00:09:09
Bohr magneton.
What we cannot understand with

151
00:09:07 --> 00:09:13
our knowledge now,
but you can if you ever take

152
00:09:11 --> 00:09:17
quantum mechanics,
that the magnetic moment of all

153
00:09:15 --> 00:09:21
electrons in orbit can only be a
multiple of this number,

154
00:09:20 --> 00:09:26
nothing in between.
Quantum mechanics,

155
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
the word says it is
quantization.

156
00:09:26 --> 00:09:32
It's not in between.
It's either or.

157
00:09:29 --> 00:09:35
It includes even 0,
which is even harder to

158
00:09:34 --> 00:09:40
understand, that it can even
be 0.

159
00:09:37 --> 00:09:43
In addition to a dipole moment
due to the electron going around

160
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
the proton, the electron itself
is a charge which spins about

161
00:09:47 --> 00:09:53
its own axis,
and that also means that a

162
00:09:50 --> 00:09:56
charge is going around on the
spinning scale of the electron.

163
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
And that magnetic dipole moment
is always this value.

164
00:09:58 --> 00:10:04
And so the net magnetic dipole
moment of an atom or a molecule

165
00:10:03 --> 00:10:09
is now the vectorial sum of all
these

166
00:10:07 --> 00:10:13
dipole moments,
all these electrons going

167
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
around, means orbital dipole
moments, and you have to add

168
00:10:14 --> 00:10:20
the spin dipoles.
Some of these pair each other

169
00:10:17 --> 00:10:23
out.
One electron would have its

170
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
dipole moment in this direction
and the other in this direction,

171
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
and then the vectorial sum is
0.

172
00:10:27 --> 00:10:33
The net result is that most
atoms and molecules have dipole

173
00:10:31 --> 00:10:37
moments which are either one
Bohr magneton or 2 Bohr

174
00:10:35 --> 00:10:41
magnetons.
That is very common.

175
00:10:37 --> 00:10:43
And that's what I will need
today to discuss with you how

176
00:10:41 --> 00:10:47
strong a field
we can create if we align all

177
00:10:47 --> 00:10:53
those magnetic dipoles.
The magnetic field that is

178
00:10:51 --> 00:10:57
produced inside a material when
I expose it to an external

179
00:10:56 --> 00:11:02
field, that magnetic field B is
the vacuum field that I can

180
00:11:01 --> 00:11:07
create with a solenoid -- we
will discuss that further today

181
00:11:07 --> 00:11:13
-- plus the field which I will
call B prime which is that

182
00:11:12 --> 00:11:18
magnetic field that is the
result of the fact that

183
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
we're going to align these
dipoles.

184
00:11:20 --> 00:11:26
The external field wants to
align these dipoles,

185
00:11:23 --> 00:11:29
and the degree of success
depends on the strength of the

186
00:11:27 --> 00:11:33
external field and of course on
the temperature.

187
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37
If the temperature is low,
it's easier to align them,

188
00:11:35 --> 00:11:41
because there is less thermal
agitation.

189
00:11:37 --> 00:11:43
If, and that's a big if --
today you will see why it's a

190
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
big if -- if B prime is linearly
proportional to B vacuum,

191
00:11:46 --> 00:11:52
if that is the case -- today
you

192
00:11:49 --> 00:11:55
will see that there are
situations where that's not the

193
00:11:54 --> 00:12:00
case -- then I can write down
that B prime equals chi of M --

194
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
we called that last lecture the
magnetic susceptibility -- times

195
00:12:06 --> 00:12:12
B vacuum.
The linear proportionality

196
00:12:09 --> 00:12:15
constant.
If I can do that,

197
00:12:12 --> 00:12:18
then of course B is also
proportional to B vacuum because

198
00:12:17 --> 00:12:23
now I can write down that B is
one plus

199
00:12:22 --> 00:12:28
chi M times B vacuum.
And that, for that we write

200
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
kappa of M times B vacuum,
which is the equation that I

201
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
started out with today.
And so that is only a

202
00:12:35 --> 00:12:41
meaningful equation if the sum
of the alignment of all these

203
00:12:40 --> 00:12:46
dipoles can be written as being
linearly proportional with the

204
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
external field.
And this is what I want to

205
00:12:49 --> 00:12:55
explore today in more detail.
With paramagnetic material,

206
00:12:55 --> 00:13:01
there is never any worry that
the linearity doesn't hold.

207
00:12:59 --> 00:13:05
But with ferromagnetic
material, that is not the case,

208
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
because with ferromagnetic
material, it is relatively easy

209
00:13:07 --> 00:13:13
to align these dipoles,
because they already group in

210
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
domains, as we discussed last
time, and the domains flip in

211
00:13:15 --> 00:13:21
unison.
And so with ferromagnetic

212
00:13:17 --> 00:13:23
material, as you will see today,
we can actually go into what we

213
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
call
saturation, that all the

214
00:13:25 --> 00:13:31
dipoles are aligned in the same
direction.

215
00:13:29 --> 00:13:35
And now the question is,
how strong would that field be?

216
00:13:33 --> 00:13:39
I'm going to make a rough
calculation that gives you a

217
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
pretty good feeling for the
numbers.

218
00:13:39 --> 00:13:45
It depends on what material you
have.

219
00:13:42 --> 00:13:48
I will choose a material
whereby the magnetic dipole

220
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52
moment is 2 Bohr magnetons,
so this is -- I told you it's

221
00:13:50 --> 00:13:56
either one or two or three,
I pick one for

222
00:13:55 --> 00:14:01
which it is two.
And I have them all aligned.

223
00:13:58 --> 00:14:04
So I take the situation that
they're all aligned.

224
00:14:02 --> 00:14:08
So here is the current going
around the nucleus,

225
00:14:06 --> 00:14:12
here's another one,
here's another one,

226
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
here's another one.
This is a solid material,

227
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
so these atoms or these
molecules are nicely packed.

228
00:14:17 --> 00:14:23
And here we see all these
currents going around,

229
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
and all these magnetic dipole
moments are nicely aligned.

230
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
And so these magnetic fields
are supporting each other.

231
00:14:31 --> 00:14:37
And the question now is,
what is the magnetic field

232
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
inside here?
Well, that's an easy

233
00:14:36 --> 00:14:42
calculation, because this really
looks like a solenoid,

234
00:14:40 --> 00:14:46
like you have windings,
and you have a current going

235
00:14:43 --> 00:14:49
around.
And you remember,

236
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
or should remember,
that if we have a solenoid and

237
00:14:48 --> 00:14:54
we run a current through a
solenoid that the magnetic field

238
00:14:52 --> 00:14:58
in the solenoid is mu 0 --
this mu 0 is not this mu,

239
00:14:57 --> 00:15:03
this mu 0 is the same one
that -- oh no,

240
00:15:00 --> 00:15:06
it's no- we don't have it on
the blackboard.

241
00:15:03 --> 00:15:09
You notice the famous
4 pi times 10 to the 

242
00:15:07 --> 00:15:13
-7.
And then we have the current I,

243
00:15:10 --> 00:15:16
and then we have N,
if that's the number of

244
00:15:13 --> 00:15:19
windings that we have in the
solenoid, and then we have L,

245
00:15:17 --> 00:15:23
which is the length of the
solenoid.

246
00:15:19 --> 00:15:25
So this is the number of
windings of the solenoid per

247
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
unit length, the number of
windings per meter.

248
00:15:26 --> 00:15:32
So if we could figure out,
for this arrangement,

249
00:15:29 --> 00:15:35
what this
quantity is,

250
00:15:32 --> 00:15:38
then we're in business.
I take a material,

251
00:15:35 --> 00:15:41
which is not unreasonable,
whereby the number density of

252
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
atoms, I call that capital N,
written in the subscript way,

253
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
is about 10 to the
29.

254
00:15:46 --> 00:15:52
So this is atoms or molecules,
whatever may be the case,

255
00:15:50 --> 00:15:56
per cubic meter.
That's not unreasonable.

256
00:15:53 --> 00:15:59
And now I have to somehow
manipulate, massage the

257
00:15:57 --> 00:16:03
mathematics, so that I get in
here this magnetic

258
00:16:02 --> 00:16:08
moment, this Bohr magneton.
The 2 Bohr magnetons.

259
00:16:06 --> 00:16:12
And there are several ways of
doing that.

260
00:16:09 --> 00:16:15
I have chosen one way,
and that's the following.

261
00:16:13 --> 00:16:19
I take here a length of 1
meter.

262
00:16:16 --> 00:16:22
So this is a solenoid,
and I take only 1 meter.

263
00:16:19 --> 00:16:25
Could have taken 3 or 5
meters, makes no difference.

264
00:16:24 --> 00:16:30
I take 1 meter.
And each one of these loops

265
00:16:28 --> 00:16:34
here has an area A.
So we would agree,

266
00:16:31 --> 00:16:37
I hope, that the area --
that the volume,

267
00:16:36 --> 00:16:42
the volume of this solenoid --
this has a length 1 meter --

268
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
that that volume is A square
meters times 1.

269
00:16:46 --> 00:16:52
And so the volume is A cubic
meters.

270
00:16:50 --> 00:16:56
A times 1 meter is A cubic
meters.

271
00:16:54 --> 00:17:00
But the number of atoms per
cubic meter is 10 to the

272
00:16:59 --> 00:17:05
29th,
and so the number of atoms that

273
00:17:04 --> 00:17:10
I
have in this solenoid per meter

274
00:17:08 --> 00:17:14
is this A times that N.
So this is the number of

275
00:17:12 --> 00:17:18
windings, if I call this one
winding, the number of windings

276
00:17:18 --> 00:17:24
per meter.
Or you can think of it the

277
00:17:21 --> 00:17:27
number of atoms per meter,
the way they're lined up.

278
00:17:26 --> 00:17:32
And so now I am in business,
because this now is my N

279
00:17:31 --> 00:17:37
divided by L.
And so I can write now mu 0

280
00:17:35 --> 00:17:41
times
the current I times that area A

281
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
times N, which is 10 to the
29.

282
00:17:43 --> 00:17:49
But look now.
Now you see why I did it this

283
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
way, because I times A is the
magnetic dipole moment of my

284
00:17:53 --> 00:17:59
atoms.
And that was 2 Bohr

285
00:17:55 --> 00:18:01
magnetons.
And so this now also equals mu

286
00:17:59 --> 00:18:05
0 times twice mu Bohr times
N.

287
00:18:02 --> 00:18:08
And I'm finished,
because I know what mu 0 is,

288
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
and I know what moo- mu Bohr is
-- we calculated that,

289
00:18:12 --> 00:18:18
it's still here,
this number -- and I know what

290
00:18:15 --> 00:18:21
my capital subscript N is,
10 to the 29 atoms

291
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
per cubic meter.
And so I just shove those

292
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
numbers in my equation,
and I find that this is

293
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
approximately 2.3
tesla for the numbers that I

294
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
have chosen.
It's not for all materials this

295
00:18:30 --> 00:18:36
way, because I have adopted 2
Bohr magnetons for the magnetic

296
00:18:34 --> 00:18:40
dipole moment of each atom,
and I have adopted a density of

297
00:18:38 --> 00:18:44
10
to the 29 atoms per

298
00:18:41 --> 00:18:47
cubic meter.
And for that situation,

299
00:18:45 --> 00:18:51
you get 2.3 tesla.
Now I want to use this number

300
00:18:50 --> 00:18:56
and understand what's going to
happen in ferromagnetic

301
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
material.
I take ferromagnetic material

302
00:18:58 --> 00:19:04
and I expose it to an external
field, I call it a vacuum

303
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
field.
So I stick it in a solenoid and

304
00:19:06 --> 00:19:12
I can choose the current
through my solenoid.

305
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
And I'm going to plot for you
the vacuum field.

306
00:19:15 --> 00:19:21
This vacuum field is linearly
proportional to the current

307
00:19:19 --> 00:19:25
through my solenoid.
This is an actual physical

308
00:19:22 --> 00:19:28
solenoid.
I have a wire,

309
00:19:24 --> 00:19:30
it goes around like this.
I don't have one here now.

310
00:19:28 --> 00:19:34
And I run a current through
there.

311
00:19:30 --> 00:19:36
And that vacuum B field equals
mu 0 times I times N divided

312
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
by L, except that this N divided
by L is now the number of

313
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
windings of my current wire,
and this is the length of my

314
00:19:45 --> 00:19:51
solenoid.
So don't confuse it with the

315
00:19:47 --> 00:19:53
one we had there,
because that was on an atomic

316
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
scale and this is on a
macroscopic scale.

317
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
How many windings you have
could be -- where you had a big

318
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
one here in class,
2800 windings,

319
00:19:58 --> 00:20:04
and we had 60 centimeters
long, and so that's what this

320
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
number is all about.
So the moment that I know what

321
00:20:05 --> 00:20:11
the current is through my
solenoid, I immediately know

322
00:20:08 --> 00:20:14
what my vacuum field is.
There's a one-to-one

323
00:20:11 --> 00:20:17
correspondence.
And now I'm going to measure

324
00:20:13 --> 00:20:19
inside
the ferromagnetic material,

325
00:20:17 --> 00:20:23
which I stick in the solenoid.
I'm going to measure there the

326
00:20:21 --> 00:20:27
magnetic field.
And what's going to happen now?

327
00:20:25 --> 00:20:31
Well, first of all I cannot at
all plot this curve on a

328
00:20:29 --> 00:20:35
one-to-one scale,
the reason being that kappa of

329
00:20:32 --> 00:20:38
M for ferromagnetic material is
so large -- let us adopt for now

330
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
a number of 1000,
say.

331
00:20:39 --> 00:20:45
Or it could be larger,
even.

332
00:20:41 --> 00:20:47
Let's say kappa of M is 1000.

333
00:20:46 --> 00:20:52
That means that if the magnetic
field in terms of a vector is

334
00:20:51 --> 00:20:57
this big, 1 centimeter in the
length of the vector,

335
00:20:56 --> 00:21:02
that the field inside the
ferromagnetic material is a

336
00:21:01 --> 00:21:07
thousand times higher.
If this is 1 centimeter in

337
00:21:06 --> 00:21:12
length, a thousand times higher
is 10 meters.

338
00:21:11 --> 00:21:17
So this is the length of the
vector

339
00:21:15 --> 00:21:21
of the magnetic field inside
the ferromagnetic material.

340
00:21:20 --> 00:21:26
That's why I cannot do it to
scale.

341
00:21:22 --> 00:21:28
So when I draw this line here,
keep in mind that if I did it

342
00:21:27 --> 00:21:33
to scale, if I did,
but I can't,

343
00:21:30 --> 00:21:36
then the tangent of alpha would
be kappa of M,

344
00:21:33 --> 00:21:39
which in this case would be 10
to the third.

345
00:21:37 --> 00:21:43
And so this angle alpha is
something like 89.9

346
00:21:42 --> 00:21:48
something degrees.
So I cannot do it to scale.

347
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
Keep that in mind.
So in the beginning I get a

348
00:21:50 --> 00:21:56
nice linear curve,
but now slowly I'm beginning to

349
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
reach saturation,
that all these dipoles are

350
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04
going to be aligned,
and what you're going to see is

351
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
that this curve bends over and
bends over and bends over,

352
00:22:06 --> 00:22:12
and the magnetic field that you
finally achieve here is the

353
00:22:10 --> 00:22:16
famous 2.3 tesla,
which I calculated for that

354
00:22:15 --> 00:22:21
imaginary material,
plus B vacuum.

355
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
The 2.3 is now the
field

356
00:22:22 --> 00:22:28
which I will call B prime.
This is the field that is the

357
00:22:25 --> 00:22:31
result of the alignment of all
those dipoles.

358
00:22:29 --> 00:22:35
And so when I increase the
vacuum field,

359
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
this goes into saturation,
and settles for 2.3

360
00:22:35 --> 00:22:41
and can no longer increase,
because I have aligned all

361
00:22:39 --> 00:22:45
these magnetic dipoles.
And so if your vacuum field is

362
00:22:43 --> 00:22:49
this strong, then this field is
no longer thousand times

363
00:22:47 --> 00:22:53
stronger than the vacuum field.
You're no longer in the linear

364
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57
part.
So you could also think of it

365
00:22:54 --> 00:23:00
as
kappa of M being smaller than a

366
00:22:57 --> 00:23:03
thousand.
Whichever way you prefer is

367
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
fine.
But it's no longer proportional

368
00:23:02 --> 00:23:08
to the value of 1000.
If the temperature is lower of

369
00:23:06 --> 00:23:12
the material,
it's easier to align them,

370
00:23:09 --> 00:23:15
and so you will achieve
saturation earlier,

371
00:23:11 --> 00:23:17
and so your curve would go like
this.

372
00:23:14 --> 00:23:20
So the curve is also a function
of temperature.

373
00:23:17 --> 00:23:23
So this is if the temperature
is low relative to this one.

374
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
So these curves depend on,
on temperature as well.

375
00:23:25 --> 00:23:31
The lower the temperature,
the easier it is to align them.

376
00:23:30 --> 00:23:36
If I reach this point here,
when my B prime goes into

377
00:23:34 --> 00:23:40
saturation, I can only increase
the field, the B field in the

378
00:23:39 --> 00:23:45
material, by increasing the
vacuum field,

379
00:23:43 --> 00:23:49
because B prime is not going to
go up again.

380
00:23:46 --> 00:23:52
And so I can only get a higher
field by increasing this current

381
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
so that this B,
this B vacuum goes up.

382
00:23:55 --> 00:24:01
And that goes up very slowly,
because this huge magnification

383
00:24:00 --> 00:24:06
factor of 1000 is gone
now.

384
00:24:02 --> 00:24:08
So the slow,
it's very slow,

385
00:24:04 --> 00:24:10
the growth, and that's why you
see that I drew it like this,

386
00:24:09 --> 00:24:15
that it increases very slowly.
But my plot is not to scale

387
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
anyhow.
Now I want to discuss with you

388
00:24:16 --> 00:24:22
what happens with the material
once I have driven it into

389
00:24:20 --> 00:24:26
saturation.
What happens if now I change

390
00:24:23 --> 00:24:29
the current and I make my vacuum
field 0 again?

391
00:24:28 --> 00:24:34
And now you get a very unusual
behavior.

392
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
Let me do that here on the
blackboard.

393
00:24:35 --> 00:24:41
So I'll make a new drawing.
I could have continued with

394
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
that one, but let me make a new
one.

395
00:24:43 --> 00:24:49
So I'm going to do the
following experiment in my head.

396
00:24:48 --> 00:24:54
I have a solenoid and I run a
current through that solenoid.

397
00:24:53 --> 00:24:59
And if the current is in
clockwise direction,

398
00:24:58 --> 00:25:04
my vacuum field will be in this
direction.

399
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
And when the current is in
counterclockwise direction,

400
00:25:04 --> 00:25:10
I will assume that my vacuum
field is in this direction.

401
00:25:08 --> 00:25:14
So there is ferromagnetic
material in here.

402
00:25:10 --> 00:25:16
If the current flows in
clockwise direction,

403
00:25:13 --> 00:25:19
the vacuum field is in this
direction.

404
00:25:15 --> 00:25:21
If I run it in counterclockwise
direction, the vacuum field is

405
00:25:19 --> 00:25:25
in that direction.
And here is going to be my

406
00:25:22 --> 00:25:28
vacuum field.
It's easy for me to know what that

407
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
is, because if I know the
current

408
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
through my solenoid,
this equation will immediately

409
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
tell me what the vacuum field
is.

410
00:25:33 --> 00:25:39
So I have never any problems
with the vacuum field.

411
00:25:37 --> 00:25:43
I stick a probe in here and I
measure the magnetic field

412
00:25:40 --> 00:25:46
inside that material.
How we do that is not so easy,

413
00:25:43 --> 00:25:49
but we can do it.
There are a few things that I

414
00:25:46 --> 00:25:52
can't tell you.
This is one of them.

415
00:25:48 --> 00:25:54
So here is the magnetic field
inside the material.

416
00:25:52 --> 00:25:58
All right, so there we start.
We do the same thing that we

417
00:25:55 --> 00:26:01
did here.
So we approach the saturation.

418
00:25:59 --> 00:26:05
But now when I'm here,
I am reducing the current and

419
00:26:02 --> 00:26:08
go back to 0.
Remember that when we are here,

420
00:26:05 --> 00:26:11
all these domains that we
discussed last time have all

421
00:26:09 --> 00:26:15
flipped in the direction of the
vacuum field.

422
00:26:11 --> 00:26:17
So this field is enormous.
But now I make the current go

423
00:26:15 --> 00:26:21
back to 0.
And what happens now is I end

424
00:26:18 --> 00:26:24
up here, at this point P here.
The current now is 0.

425
00:26:21 --> 00:26:27
There is no current going
through the solenoid.

426
00:26:24 --> 00:26:30
Notice the vacuum field is
0.

427
00:26:26 --> 00:26:32
I can take the material out,
the ferromagnetic material.

428
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
The material itself is now
magnetic.

429
00:26:33 --> 00:26:39
And you see there is a magnetic
field inside it.

430
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
Why is that?
Because some of those domains

431
00:26:41 --> 00:26:47
remain aligned,
they don't go back.

432
00:26:44 --> 00:26:50
And so we have created
permanent magnetism.

433
00:26:47 --> 00:26:53
And so in the location,
at the location P,

434
00:26:50 --> 00:26:56
we have B vacuum is 0,
but B prime,

435
00:26:53 --> 00:26:59
which is the result of those
aligned magnetic moments,

436
00:26:57 --> 00:27:03
is still in this direction.
Nothing is to scale here,

437
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
of course.
And so you still have a

438
00:27:05 --> 00:27:11
magnetic field.
Now I reverse the current.

439
00:27:08 --> 00:27:14
I go counterclockwise.
So I'm creating a magnetic

440
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
field vacuum now in this
direction.

441
00:27:14 --> 00:27:20
And so now what will happen
with this curve?

442
00:27:17 --> 00:27:23
I come up here.
And look now here,

443
00:27:19 --> 00:27:25
at this location Q.
What do I have now?

444
00:27:21 --> 00:27:27
I have something very bizarre.
I have now a situation whereby

445
00:27:25 --> 00:27:31
the vacuum field is in this
direction but there is no

446
00:27:29 --> 00:27:35
magnetic field inside the
material.

447
00:27:31 --> 00:27:37
The magnetic field inside is
0.

448
00:27:35 --> 00:27:41
So when we have point Q,
so we have B vacuum is in this

449
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
direction, but B inside,
B prime -- oh no,

450
00:27:42 --> 00:27:48
it's not B prime,
it's B.

451
00:27:44 --> 00:27:50
It's the total field inside,
is 0.

452
00:27:47 --> 00:27:53
The reason being that B prime
is still in this direction.

453
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
The reason being that the
domains are still aligned in

454
00:27:55 --> 00:28:01
this direction,
and so the vacuum field plus

455
00:27:58 --> 00:28:04
the B prime field,
which has to be vectorially

456
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
added, adds up with a net field
0.

457
00:28:06 --> 00:28:12
Quite bizarre,
isn't it?

458
00:28:07 --> 00:28:13
Now I increase the current,
but I keep going

459
00:28:11 --> 00:28:17
counterclockwise,
and so the magnetic field of

460
00:28:14 --> 00:28:20
the vacuum remains in this
direction.

461
00:28:17 --> 00:28:23
I go into saturation again,
in a similar way that I went

462
00:28:21 --> 00:28:27
into saturation here.
And now I stop here -- oh,

463
00:28:25 --> 00:28:31
I don't want to lose my brooch.
And now I stop here and I say

464
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
to the current,
go back to 0 again.

465
00:28:32 --> 00:28:38
So my current now goes back to
0.

466
00:28:35 --> 00:28:41
There we go.
And now I arrive here,

467
00:28:39 --> 00:28:45
point S.
And again, I have a situation

468
00:28:41 --> 00:28:47
that my vacuum field is 0.
I could take the material out

469
00:28:45 --> 00:28:51
of the solenoid,
just walk around with it on the

470
00:28:48 --> 00:28:54
street.
It will be a permanent magnet.

471
00:28:50 --> 00:28:56
But now the magnetic field
inside this material in point P

472
00:28:54 --> 00:29:00
it was in this direction.
If I take it out here,

473
00:28:57 --> 00:29:03
then it is in this direction.
Now some domains stay aligned in

474
00:29:01 --> 00:29:07
this direction.
The reason was that I had

475
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
counterclockwise current,
and so those domains flipped

476
00:29:07 --> 00:29:13
over.
And they're not all willing to

477
00:29:11 --> 00:29:17
flip back again.
So I've also made a permanent

478
00:29:15 --> 00:29:21
magnet here.
Vacuum field 0,

479
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
but B prime is now in the
opposite direction.

480
00:29:21 --> 00:29:27
And then if I continue now to
go clockwise with current again

481
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
and increase the current,
I end up there.

482
00:29:28 --> 00:29:34
And this is a bizarre curve.
We call this the hysteresis

483
00:29:33 --> 00:29:39
curve.
If you look at this curve,

484
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
it's really amazing.
It's actually hard to,

485
00:29:39 --> 00:29:45
to digest this.
You, you have to give it a

486
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
little bit of thought.
Because for one particular

487
00:29:46 --> 00:29:52
value of the current,
for instance here,

488
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
once I have a particular value
of the current,

489
00:29:52 --> 00:29:58
I know that B vacuum is a
given, I have two possibilities

490
00:29:56 --> 00:30:02
here for the magnetic field.
And for the current here,

491
00:30:00 --> 00:30:06
I have two possibilities for
the magnetic field.

492
00:30:03 --> 00:30:09
And so I cannot even know when
I take this material and I

493
00:30:07 --> 00:30:13
expose it to an external field,
I can't even calculate what the

494
00:30:14 --> 00:30:20
magnetic field inside will be.
It depends on the history of

495
00:30:20 --> 00:30:26
this material.
Look at this point here and at

496
00:30:25 --> 00:30:31
this point there.
If I asked you what is kappa of

497
00:30:30 --> 00:30:36
M, [pff] it's almost a
ridiculous question.

498
00:30:34 --> 00:30:40
Because what is kappa of M?
I have, um, I have a vacuum

499
00:30:40 --> 00:30:46
field,
but I have no field inside.

500
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
So the field inside,
which is B, is 0,

501
00:30:46 --> 00:30:52
and the vacuum field is not
0.

502
00:30:49 --> 00:30:55
So you would have to answer,
kappa M is 0.

503
00:30:51 --> 00:30:57
That's the only thing you could
say.

504
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
Quite bizarre,
right.

505
00:30:55 --> 00:31:01
But right here,
there is a vacuum field but no

506
00:30:58 --> 00:31:04
field inside.
So kappa M is 0 here and

507
00:31:00 --> 00:31:06
kappa M is 0 here.
And remember,

508
00:31:03 --> 00:31:09
here it was 1000.
Look at the situation,

509
00:31:06 --> 00:31:12
take this point of the curve
and this point of the curve.

510
00:31:09 --> 00:31:15
Kappa M is less than 0,
is negative,

511
00:31:12 --> 00:31:18
because here the vacuum
field is in this direction,

512
00:31:16 --> 00:31:22
but B prime is in that
direction, so they are in

513
00:31:19 --> 00:31:25
opposite directions,
so the net field is in that

514
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
direction, but B vacuum is in
this direction.

515
00:31:25 --> 00:31:31
And here it's also reversed.
So there's a bizarre situation

516
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
that you are effectively having
situations whereby kappa of M is

517
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
0 and kappa of M can also be
negative for those s- points

518
00:31:37 --> 00:31:43
that I have there.
I can show you this hysteresis

519
00:31:41 --> 00:31:47
curve, and I do it exactly the
way that I explained to you,

520
00:31:45 --> 00:31:51
except that I will not be able
to run this current very slowly

521
00:31:50 --> 00:31:56
up and down.
I do it with 60 hertz

522
00:31:53 --> 00:31:59
alternating current,
just get it out of the,

523
00:31:56 --> 00:32:02
the wall.
And so I run through this

524
00:31:59 --> 00:32:05
solenoid n- 60 hertz
alternating current.

525
00:32:02 --> 00:32:08
That means we go through this
curve very quickly back and

526
00:32:06 --> 00:32:12
forth.
Between this point maximum

527
00:32:09 --> 00:32:15
current and this point maximum
current.

528
00:32:12 --> 00:32:18
The current clockwise,
counterclockwise, clockwise,

529
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23
counterclockwise,
and we change that 60 times

530
00:32:20 --> 00:32:26
per second.
And then I will show you this

531
00:32:23 --> 00:32:29
curve, again,
highly distorted.

532
00:32:25 --> 00:32:31
I cannot plot it one-to-one,
for the reasons that I

533
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
explained to you.
And you will see then the

534
00:32:31 --> 00:32:37
hysteresis curve.
That's called the hysteresis

535
00:32:34 --> 00:32:40
curve.
And for that,

536
00:32:35 --> 00:32:41
I have to do several things.
And I always forget what I have

537
00:32:39 --> 00:32:45
to do, but just don't worry
about it, I will find out.

538
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
My TV goes on.
This light goes off and this

539
00:32:46 --> 00:32:52
light goes off.
Look there on the screen,

540
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
and you will see within seconds
there is the hysteresis curve.

541
00:32:55 --> 00:33:01
And as I said to you earlier,
I cannot start here,

542
00:32:58 --> 00:33:04
unfortunately,
because we switch it so fast

543
00:33:01 --> 00:33:07
back and forth that this part of
the curve, by the way,

544
00:33:05 --> 00:33:11
which is called the virginal
curve -- virginal,

545
00:33:08 --> 00:33:14
because it's once and never
again.

546
00:33:10 --> 00:33:16
Once you have reached that
point, from that moment on,

547
00:33:14 --> 00:33:20
you always stick to this -- I
know, you should know about

548
00:33:18 --> 00:33:24
that.
[laughter].

549
00:33:19 --> 00:33:25
And so here you see a striking
example of a hysteresis curve.

550
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
And so you can ask yourself now
the question,

551
00:33:27 --> 00:33:33
can we make this material
virginal again?

552
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36
And then the answer is yes.
There are various ways you can

553
00:33:33 --> 00:33:39
do that.
One way is you could take the

554
00:33:35 --> 00:33:41
material out,
so that means you take it out,

555
00:33:38 --> 00:33:44
for instance,
when there is remnant magnetism

556
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
here, so it's a magnet,
and now you heat it up above

557
00:33:44 --> 00:33:50
the Curie point,
as we did last time in my

558
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
lecture, and then the domains
completely fall apart,

559
00:33:49 --> 00:33:55
and then you cool it again
below the Curie point,

560
00:33:54 --> 00:34:00
and then it is virginal
material again.

561
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
And then you could start here
again.

562
00:33:58 --> 00:34:04
That's one way you could do it.
There is another way you could

563
00:34:01 --> 00:34:07
try to do it.
You take a hammer and you just

564
00:34:03 --> 00:34:09
bang on it.
So you take it out and you have

565
00:34:05 --> 00:34:11
permanent magnetism,
either here or there,

566
00:34:08 --> 00:34:14
and you bang on it,
and you hope for the best.

567
00:34:10 --> 00:34:16
And maybe you can get it back
to here.

568
00:34:12 --> 00:34:18
There is another way,
which we call demagnetization,

569
00:34:15 --> 00:34:21
and I think that's what happens
when you steal a book in the

570
00:34:18 --> 00:34:24
library and you try to get away
with it, and the alarm goes off.

571
00:34:21 --> 00:34:27
Someone hasn't demagnetized the
magnetic strip in the book.

572
00:34:26 --> 00:34:32
You may have noticed that when
you take it out,

573
00:34:28 --> 00:34:34
that someone under the table
goes like this.

574
00:34:31 --> 00:34:37
And what they are doing then is
they are demagnetizing that

575
00:34:34 --> 00:34:40
strip.
And the way you do that is as

576
00:34:36 --> 00:34:42
follows.
Here the current goes back and

577
00:34:39 --> 00:34:45
forth between this value and
this value.

578
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
That means B vacuum and I are
directly coupled to each other.

579
00:34:45 --> 00:34:51
So I think of this as being
current.

580
00:34:47 --> 00:34:53
And now I go up to here and
then back and then here and here

581
00:34:50 --> 00:34:56
and here and here and here and
here and here and here and here

582
00:34:54 --> 00:35:00
and
I end up there again.

583
00:34:57 --> 00:35:03
And I can show you that.
So again you have alternating

584
00:35:00 --> 00:35:06
current, but the amplitude of
the current you decrease and

585
00:35:04 --> 00:35:10
decrease and decrease,
and you're going to see that

586
00:35:08 --> 00:35:14
there.
And you see that I can turn

587
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
this material -- see the
hysteresis curve changes.

588
00:35:13 --> 00:35:19
So the amplitude of the current
is not as large,

589
00:35:17 --> 00:35:23
so the amplitude of the B
vacuum is not as large,

590
00:35:20 --> 00:35:26
and I slowly go back.
And I can change a non-virgin

591
00:35:24 --> 00:35:30
back into a virgin.
And that's the way we do it as

592
00:35:30 --> 00:35:36
physicists.
Demagnetization.

593
00:35:33 --> 00:35:39
Did I turn that off?
Yes, I did.

594
00:35:37 --> 00:35:43
I have here a,
a coil.

595
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
You can't see that there is a
coil inside here,

596
00:35:45 --> 00:35:51
but there is.
I can, uh, power this coil,

597
00:35:49 --> 00:35:55
putting a current through it.
Ferromagnetic material,

598
00:35:57 --> 00:36:03
I don't know what kappa is,
but, uh, at least a thousand.

599
00:36:01 --> 00:36:07
I get an enormously strong
field inside here.

600
00:36:04 --> 00:36:10
And this field is so strong
that this piece of ferromagnetic

601
00:36:08 --> 00:36:14
material will be attracted.
The field is non-uniform

602
00:36:11 --> 00:36:17
outside.
We discussed last time that it

603
00:36:13 --> 00:36:19
will go clunk,
it will stick there.

604
00:36:16 --> 00:36:22
So let's do that.
So I power this electromagnet

605
00:36:19 --> 00:36:25
-- you can't see that I did,
you have to take my word for

606
00:36:22 --> 00:36:28
it, but you believe it now.
There it goes.

607
00:36:25 --> 00:36:31
Oh boy.
The force is so large that I

608
00:36:28 --> 00:36:34
would ask two people to come and
see

609
00:36:31 --> 00:36:37
whether they can pull it apart.
The force that the two are

610
00:36:35 --> 00:36:41
together is so large that you
may not even be able to separate

611
00:36:39 --> 00:36:45
it.
Do we have two strong people?

612
00:36:41 --> 00:36:47
One strong woman,
one strong man.

613
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
You look very strong to me.
[laughter].

614
00:36:46 --> 00:36:52
Come on.
It's not going to be a tug of

615
00:36:48 --> 00:36:54
war between the two of you.
That's not my plan.

616
00:36:51 --> 00:36:57
Be very careful,
because if you touch this,

617
00:36:54 --> 00:37:00
you get electrocuted.
So don't do that.

618
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
[laughter].
But make sure that everyone can

619
00:36:59 --> 00:37:05
see you.
Because there is a current

620
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
running through this solenoid
now, yeah?

621
00:37:05 --> 00:37:11
OK.
Now just in case that you

622
00:37:06 --> 00:37:12
succeed, I don't want you to get
hurt.

623
00:37:09 --> 00:37:15
Student: OK.
So make sure that you secure

624
00:37:11 --> 00:37:17
yourself.
[laughter].

625
00:37:12 --> 00:37:18
Because suppose the current
stopped running all of a sudden.

626
00:37:16 --> 00:37:22
It's possible,
it's MIT [laughter] right,

627
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24
anything could happen.
Then, of course,

628
00:37:20 --> 00:37:26
it's no longer a strong magnet.
It's only a strong magnet as

629
00:37:24 --> 00:37:30
long as the current is running
through the solenoid.

630
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33
So you secure yourself too.
OK, three, two, one, zero, go.

631
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
[laughter].
Don't worry.

632
00:37:32 --> 00:37:38
I knew
that in advance.

633
00:37:35 --> 00:37:41
But thank you very much.
[laughter].

634
00:37:38 --> 00:37:44
Very kind of you.
[applause].

635
00:37:41 --> 00:37:47
Now comes something that you
will understand.

636
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
If I make the current go to
0, then the vacuum field goes

637
00:37:51 --> 00:37:57
to 0.
That means the field that is

638
00:37:54 --> 00:38:00
generated by the solenoid goes
to 0.

639
00:37:58 --> 00:38:04
I will do that now in front of
your own eyes.

640
00:38:02 --> 00:38:08
No more current,
right?

641
00:38:06 --> 00:38:12
Why is this still hanging
there?

642
00:38:08 --> 00:38:14
Yeah?
The solenoid [inaudible]

643
00:38:10 --> 00:38:16
magnetize the ferrous
[inaudible].

644
00:38:13 --> 00:38:19
You hear?
You've taken the vacuum field

645
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
out, but the domains to a
certain degree are still

646
00:38:19 --> 00:38:25
aligned, and so the whole thing
is still a magnet.

647
00:38:23 --> 00:38:29
Not as strong as magnet -- if I
were to invite you to come now

648
00:38:28 --> 00:38:34
and take it apart,
you could.

649
00:38:30 --> 00:38:36
But it still takes sub-
substantial force.

650
00:38:33 --> 00:38:39
And I will show you how
large that force is.

651
00:38:38 --> 00:38:44
I'm going to load it down now.
There's now 1 kilogram

652
00:38:42 --> 00:38:48
hanging on it.
Ooh, let me make sure I secure

653
00:38:46 --> 00:38:52
that, otherwise I can get killed
for a change.

654
00:38:50 --> 00:38:56
OK, 3 kilograms is hanging
on it now.

655
00:38:54 --> 00:39:00
5 kilograms is hanging on it
now.

656
00:38:57 --> 00:39:03
7 kilograms is hanging on
it now.

657
00:39:00 --> 00:39:06
9 kilograms is hanging on it
now.

658
00:39:03 --> 00:39:09
Oh boy, we may never make it.
10 kilograms is -- there it

659
00:39:08 --> 00:39:14
goes.
[laughter].

660
00:39:11 --> 00:39:17
10 kilograms.
Now the show is not over yet.

661
00:39:15 --> 00:39:21
What is very interesting,
and I want you to think about

662
00:39:21 --> 00:39:27
it, that if now I take these two
pieces of -- [laughter].

663
00:39:27 --> 00:39:33
If I take these two pieces of
ferromagnetic material,

664
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
that -- nothing.
Do you know why?

665
00:39:37 --> 00:39:43
I dropped it on the floor.
[laughter].

666
00:39:42 --> 00:39:48
That's really why.
I dropped it on the floor,

667
00:39:45 --> 00:39:51
and that is like banging it
with a hammer,

668
00:39:47 --> 00:39:53
and then the domains go away.
Had I not dropped it on the

669
00:39:50 --> 00:39:56
floor [laughter],
there would have been something

670
00:39:53 --> 00:39:59
left, but very little,
which is interesting by itself.

671
00:39:57 --> 00:40:03
The shock of the separation,
when that happened,

672
00:39:59 --> 00:40:05
already makes many of the
domains flip back,

673
00:40:02 --> 00:40:08
and there would be very little
left.

674
00:40:04 --> 00:40:10
Not enough to carry this weight
anymore, but that's largely

675
00:40:08 --> 00:40:14
because I dropped it on the
floor.

676
00:40:10 --> 00:40:16
I did that purposely so you can
see

677
00:40:13 --> 00:40:19
when you drop [laughter] things
on the floor.

678
00:40:17 --> 00:40:23
If I bring ferromagnetic
material in the vicinity of a

679
00:40:22 --> 00:40:28
magnet, I change the magnetic
field configuration,

680
00:40:27 --> 00:40:33
and that's very easy to
understand now.

681
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
Suppose I have here a magnet,
north pole, south pole,

682
00:40:35 --> 00:40:41
and the magnetic field,
magnetic dipole field is sort

683
00:40:40 --> 00:40:46
of like this.
And now I bring in the vicinity

684
00:40:44 --> 00:40:50
here
a piece of ferromagnetic

685
00:40:47 --> 00:40:53
material.
Could be a wrench.

686
00:40:49 --> 00:40:55
What happens now is that this
ferromagnetic material will see

687
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59
this vacuum field -- this is
called the vacuum field,

688
00:40:56 --> 00:41:02
is an external field.
And so these domains in there

689
00:40:59 --> 00:41:05
trying to align a little bit.
Degree of success depends on

690
00:41:03 --> 00:41:09
how strong the field is,
depends on the temperature,

691
00:41:06 --> 00:41:12
depends on the kappa M of that
material.

692
00:41:09 --> 00:41:15
But certainly this will become
sort of a south pole,

693
00:41:12 --> 00:41:18
this will become a north pole.
That's the way that these

694
00:41:16 --> 00:41:22
dipoles
are going to align themselves.

695
00:41:20 --> 00:41:26
They are going to create
themselves a field in this

696
00:41:23 --> 00:41:29
direction.
They're going to support that

697
00:41:25 --> 00:41:31
field.
And so the net result is that

698
00:41:27 --> 00:41:33
the field inside here becomes
very strong.

699
00:41:30 --> 00:41:36
And so what happens with these
field lines, they go like this.

700
00:41:34 --> 00:41:40
They're being sucked into this
ferromagnetic material.

701
00:41:37 --> 00:41:43
It's very hard to know exactly
how they go.

702
00:41:40 --> 00:41:46
And the field here will weaken.
And I'm going to demonstrate

703
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
that to you.
This is actually very easy to

704
00:41:46 --> 00:41:52
demonstrate.
And the way I'm going to

705
00:41:50 --> 00:41:56
demonstrate that is as follows.
I have there a setup whereby we

706
00:41:56 --> 00:42:02
have a, a magnet and we have a
nail and we have a string.

707
00:42:01 --> 00:42:07
And the nail wants to go to the
magnet.

708
00:42:04 --> 00:42:10
The mail its- the nail itself
is, uh, ferromagnetic.

709
00:42:09 --> 00:42:15
So the nail would love to go in
this direction,

710
00:42:13 --> 00:42:19
but it can't.
So it just sits there,

711
00:42:16 --> 00:42:22
hangs there in space.
First of all,

712
00:42:21 --> 00:42:27
what I want to show you is that
if I bring paramagnetic material

713
00:42:25 --> 00:42:31
in the vicinity,
that that magnetic field

714
00:42:27 --> 00:42:33
configuration here is not going
to change at all.

715
00:42:30 --> 00:42:36
Paramagnetic material has a
kappa of M so close to one that

716
00:42:34 --> 00:42:40
nothing is going to happen.
But the moment that I bring

717
00:42:37 --> 00:42:43
ferromagnetic material,
for instance,

718
00:42:39 --> 00:42:45
here, then you get a field
configuration change,

719
00:42:42 --> 00:42:48
and if I do that just the right
way, then the nail will fall.

720
00:42:46 --> 00:42:52
In other words,
there is not enough magnetic

721
00:42:49 --> 00:42:55
field here in order to hold the
nail in that direction.

722
00:42:53 --> 00:42:59
And I'm going to show that for
you, to you there.

723
00:42:58 --> 00:43:04
Need some power here,
I believe, and we have to make

724
00:43:02 --> 00:43:08
it dark here.
I'm going to shadow project it

725
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
for you.
And the shadow projection you

726
00:43:10 --> 00:43:16
will see coming up very shortly.
This is a carbon arc.

727
00:43:15 --> 00:43:21
You have to give it a little
bit of time to start.

728
00:43:20 --> 00:43:26
There is the carbon arc.
So there you see the nail.

729
00:43:26 --> 00:43:32
And here you see the magnet.
You see that?

730
00:43:29 --> 00:43:35
That's exactly the way I drew
the picture.

731
00:43:33 --> 00:43:39
And here, you hav- I have here
a piece of aluminum,

732
00:43:38 --> 00:43:44
which is paramagnetic.
I can bring that through the

733
00:43:43 --> 00:43:49
field here.
Nothing happens.

734
00:43:45 --> 00:43:51
My hands, believe it or not,
are definitely not

735
00:43:50 --> 00:43:56
ferromagnetic,
so I can also bring my hands

736
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
here.
Nothing.

737
00:43:55 --> 00:44:01
Nothing.
So magnetic field is not

738
00:43:59 --> 00:44:05
disturbed in any way,
in any serious way,

739
00:44:01 --> 00:44:07
either by paramagnetic
material, aluminum,

740
00:44:04 --> 00:44:10
or my hands,
which I think are also

741
00:44:06 --> 00:44:12
paramagnetic,
but I'm not sure.

742
00:44:08 --> 00:44:14
I'm not sure whether I'm
diamagnetic or paramagnetic,

743
00:44:11 --> 00:44:17
but it doesn't make any
difference, because in both

744
00:44:14 --> 00:44:20
cases there is no significant
change of the magnetic field.

745
00:44:18 --> 00:44:24
But now I have a wrench here.
Here, there's a wrench.

746
00:44:21 --> 00:44:27
You see it?
[laughter].

747
00:44:23 --> 00:44:29
OK.
And now I'll bring the wrench

748
00:44:25 --> 00:44:31
close to that magnet.
My major worry is that magnetic

749
00:44:30 --> 00:44:36
field is so strong that once the
wrench go- there's no way I can

750
00:44:35 --> 00:44:41
get it off again.
So I get only one shot at it.

751
00:44:39 --> 00:44:45
And there goes the nail.
So what I -- what you saw now

752
00:44:44 --> 00:44:50
in front of your own eyes is that I
changed the magnetic field

753
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
configuration in such a way that
the field was not strong enough

754
00:44:54 --> 00:45:00
to pull in the,
the nail.

755
00:44:57 --> 00:45:03
Now comes an important
question, a big moment in our

756
00:45:03 --> 00:45:09
life.
And that is,

757
00:45:05 --> 00:45:11
what now is the effect of
magnetic material on Maxwell's

758
00:45:12 --> 00:45:18
equations?
And let's take a look at

759
00:45:16 --> 00:45:22
Maxwell's equations.
Here we have Maxwell's

760
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
equations the way we know them.
[laughter].

761
00:45:26 --> 00:45:32
And let's first look at number
one.

762
00:45:31 --> 00:45:37
That's Gauss's Law.
Gauss's Law says that the

763
00:45:35 --> 00:45:41
closed surface integral of E dot dA -- that's the electric flux

764
00:45:39 --> 00:45:45
through a closed surface -- E- is
equal to all the charge inside

765
00:45:44 --> 00:45:50
divided by epsilon 0,
but you have to allow for the

766
00:45:47 --> 00:45:53
kappa, for the electric,
dielectric constant.

767
00:45:51 --> 00:45:57
The kappa, by the way,
always lowers the field inside

768
00:45:54 --> 00:46:00
the material when we deal with
electric fields.

769
00:45:58 --> 00:46:04
It never increases it like
magnetic

770
00:46:01 --> 00:46:07
fields.
It always lowers it.

771
00:46:03 --> 00:46:09
Kappa is normally a few --
except for water,

772
00:46:06 --> 00:46:12
it is 80,
it's quite large,

773
00:46:08 --> 00:46:14
and there are some ridiculous
substances whereby kappa can be

774
00:46:11 --> 00:46:17
as large as 300.
I think strontium titanate -- I

775
00:46:15 --> 00:46:21
just looked it up this morning
-- has a ridiculous value of

776
00:46:18 --> 00:46:24
kappa of 300.
So that's Gauss's Law.

777
00:46:21 --> 00:46:27
Nothing's going to change there
as far as I can see.

778
00:46:24 --> 00:46:30
And then we have the second
one.

779
00:46:26 --> 00:46:32
The closed surface integral of
B dot dL equals 0.

780
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
Oh, it says an,
it says an L.

781
00:46:33 --> 00:46:39
That shouldn't even be an L.
Ho, I hope you caught that.

782
00:46:36 --> 00:46:42
This is an A,
of course.

783
00:46:38 --> 00:46:44
How could I?
This is the closed surface

784
00:46:40 --> 00:46:46
integral of B dot dA is 0.
What this is telling me is that

785
00:46:44 --> 00:46:50
magnetic ma- magnetic monopoles
don't exist.

786
00:46:47 --> 00:46:53
At least we think they don't
exist.

787
00:46:49 --> 00:46:55
Don't think that people are not
trying to find them.

788
00:46:52 --> 00:46:58
And if you find a magnetic
monopole, and if you put that

789
00:46:56 --> 00:47:02
inside a box,
then the closed surface

790
00:46:58 --> 00:47:04
integral of the magnetic flux
through that box

791
00:47:02 --> 00:47:08
would not be 0.
And so then this is not true.

792
00:47:06 --> 00:47:12
But as far as we know,
it's always true,

793
00:47:09 --> 00:47:15
because we don't think that
magnetic poles- monopoles exist.

794
00:47:13 --> 00:47:19
And so then we come to the
Faraday's Law.

795
00:47:16 --> 00:47:22
Faraday's Law runs our economy.
Faraday's Law tells you when

796
00:47:21 --> 00:47:27
you move conducting loops in
magnetic fields that you create

797
00:47:25 --> 00:47:31
electricity.
This equation runs our economy.

798
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
And now we come -- none of
these, by the way,

799
00:47:33 --> 00:47:39
require any adjustment in terms
of kappa of M.

800
00:47:36 --> 00:47:42
But now we come to Ampere's
Law.

801
00:47:39 --> 00:47:45
Ampere's Law,
which was amended by Maxwell

802
00:47:42 --> 00:47:48
himself, tells me what the
magnetic field is,

803
00:47:45 --> 00:47:51
and all these results are for
vacuum.

804
00:47:48 --> 00:47:54
But now we know that that's not
true anymore.

805
00:47:51 --> 00:47:57
So this has to be adjusted now
by a factor of kappa of M,

806
00:47:56 --> 00:48:02
which is the relative
permeability.

807
00:47:58 --> 00:48:04
And kappa of M is perfectly
kosher for paramagnetic and

808
00:48:02 --> 00:48:08
diamagnetic
materials.

809
00:48:05 --> 00:48:11
There's never any problem
there.

810
00:48:07 --> 00:48:13
So here it comes.
For diamagnetic materials,

811
00:48:10 --> 00:48:16
it's a little less than one.
For paramagnetic materials,

812
00:48:14 --> 00:48:20
a little larger than one.
But when we deal with

813
00:48:17 --> 00:48:23
ferromagnetic materials,
you have to be very careful,

814
00:48:21 --> 00:48:27
because we have seen today this
hysteresis phenomenon,

815
00:48:24 --> 00:48:30
that there are even situations
whereby kappa of M is negative,

816
00:48:28 --> 00:48:34
whereby kappa M is 0,
and whereby kappa M can be

817
00:48:32 --> 00:48:38
huge, can be 10 to the 3.
So there you have to be very,

818
00:48:37 --> 00:48:43
very careful when you apply
this equation without thinking.

819
00:48:43 --> 00:48:49
Maxwell's equations are so
important that I'm sure you want

820
00:48:49 --> 00:48:55
to see more of them.
So you see them there again.

821
00:48:54 --> 00:49:00
And maybe that's not enough.
[laughter].

822
00:48:58 --> 00:49:04
Maybe you want to see even more
of them.

823
00:49:01 --> 00:49:07
So look at them.
Inhale them.

824
00:49:04 --> 00:49:10
Let them penetrate your
brains.

825
00:49:09 --> 00:49:15
[laughter].
I don't care in which direction

826
00:49:13 --> 00:49:19
you look now.
It's hard not to see them.

827
00:49:16 --> 00:49:22
Today is therefore very
special, because today we have

828
00:49:21 --> 00:49:27
all four Maxwell's equations in
place.

829
00:49:25 --> 00:49:31
And this was one of the main
objectives of 8.02.

830
00:49:30 --> 00:49:36
So we have completed a long
journey, and on April 5, we

831
00:49:36 --> 00:49:42
have reached the summit.
Now I realize that the view is

832
00:49:41 --> 00:49:47
not spectacular for all of you
yet, because often at the summit

833
00:49:46 --> 00:49:52
there is some fog.
But the fog will clear.

834
00:49:49 --> 00:49:55
And I can assure you that from
here on on, it's climbing

835
00:49:53 --> 00:49:59
downhill.
I think this moment is worth

836
00:49:55 --> 00:50:01
celebrating, and therefore I
bought 600 daffodils for

837
00:49:59 --> 00:50:05
this occasion.
[laughter].

838
00:50:01 --> 00:50:07
And I would like you to come at
the, at the end of the lecture

839
00:50:06 --> 00:50:12
and pick up one of these
daffodils and take it back to

840
00:50:09 --> 00:50:15
your dormitory.
I don't know whether I have

841
00:50:14 --> 00:50:20
enough for all these high school
students and all their parents,

842
00:50:18 --> 00:50:24
but why not,
give it a shot,

843
00:50:20 --> 00:50:26
and take one.
And when you look at it tonight

844
00:50:23 --> 00:50:29
at home and tomorrow,
remember that you only once in

845
00:50:26 --> 00:50:32
your life go through this
experience, that for the first

846
00:50:30 --> 00:50:36
time you see all four Maxwell's
equations complete,

847
00:50:34 --> 00:50:40
hold it, and that you're
capable of appreciating them,

848
00:50:38 --> 00:50:44
at least in principle.
This will never happen again.

849
00:50:41 --> 00:50:47
You will never be the
same.

850
00:50:45 --> 00:50:51
[laughter].
To put it in simple terms,

851
00:50:50 --> 00:50:56
as far as 8.02 is
concerned, you are no longer

852
00:50:58 --> 00:51:04
unspoiled virginal material
[laughter].

853
00:51:04 --> 00:51:10
You've lost your virginity.
[laughter].

854
00:51:10 --> 00:51:16
Congratulations!
[laughter].

855
00:51:14 --> 00:51:20
[applause].
[crowd noise].
