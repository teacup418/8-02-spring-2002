00:00:00 --> 00:00:07



2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:11,842
Today, I will quantify the
ability of a circuit to fight a

3
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:16,684
magnetic flux that is produced
by the circuits themselves.

4
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:21,271
If you have a circuit and you
run a current through the

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,093
circuit, then you create some
magnetic fields,

6
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:29,256
and if the currents are
changing then the magnetic

7
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:33,588
fields are changing.
And so there will be an induced

8
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:37,666
EMF in that circuit that fights
the

9
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:42,94
change, and we express that in
terms of a self-inductance:

10
00:00:42,94 --> 00:00:47,289
L self-inductance ,
and the word self speaks for

11
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:50,158
itself.
It's doing it to itself.

12
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:55,155
Magnetic flux that is produced
by the circuit is always

13
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:59,875
proportional to the current.
You double the current,

14
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:03,761
the magnetic flux doubles.
And so it is the

15
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:10,331
proportionality constant that we
call L that is the

16
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:15,631
self-inductance,
and so therefore the induced

17
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:21,533
EMF equals minus D five ET,
that is Faraday's Law.

18
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:25,507
And so that becomes minus L DI
DT.

19
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:32,372
L is only a matter of geometry.
L is not a function of the

20
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:37,913
current itself.
I will calculate for you a very

21
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:43,333
simple case of the
self-inductance

22
00:01:43,333 --> 0.
of a solenoid.

23
0. --> 00:01:44,687
yes, there you see this,

24
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:49,292
Let this be a solenoid and this
is a closed circuit,

25
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:53,265
and we want a current I through
the solenoid,

26
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:57,238
and the radius of these
windings is little R.

27
00:01:57,238 --> 00:02:02,475
Let's say they're N windings
and the length of the solenoid

28
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:06,358
is little L.
Perhaps you'll remember that we

29
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:09,609
earlier derived,
using *Empea's* Law,

30
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:14,665
that the magnetic field inside
the

31
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:19,006
solenoids is new zero times I
times capital N divided by L.

32
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,999
This is the number of windings
per meter.

33
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:25,591
If we attach an open surface to
this closed loop,

34
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:30,156
very difficult to imagine what
that open surface looks like --

35
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:34,646
we discussed that many times --
inside this solenoid you have

36
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:37,265
sort of a staircase-like of
surface.

37
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:41,904
That magnetic field penetrates
that surface N times because you

38
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:45,903
have N loops.
And so the magnetic flux,

39
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:49,407
file B, is simply the area by
little R squared,

40
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:53,9
which is the surface area of
one loop, because I assume that

41
00:02:53,9 --> 00:02:57,708
the magnetic field is constant
inside the solenoid,

42
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:02,049
and I assume that it is zero
outside, which is a very good

43
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,324
approximation.
So we get pi little R squared

44
00:03:05,324 --> 00:03:09,437
surface area of one loop,
then we have N loops and then

45
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:13,549
we have to multiply it by that
constant magnetic field.

46
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:18,5
So we get an N squared because
we have an N here,

47
00:03:18,5 --> 00:03:23,774
new zero I divided by L.
And this we call L times I.

48
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:27,91
That's our definition for
self-inductors.

49
00:03:27,91 --> 00:03:32,77
And so the self-inductions L is
purely geometry.

50
00:03:32,77 --> 00:03:38,355
It's pi level R squared,
capital N squared divided by L

51
00:03:38,355 --> 0.
times new zero.

52
0. --> 00:03:40,009
yes, there you see this,

53
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,939
Let me check this.
Pi little R squared,

54
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:51,169
I have a capital N squared,
new zero, that's correct,

55
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,338
divided by little L.
And so we can calculate,

56
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:59,224
for instance,
what this self-inductance is

57
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:04,436
for a solenoid that we have used
in class several times.

58
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:09,648
We had one whereby we had
twenty eight hundred windings.

59
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:15,24
R I think was something like
five centimeters -- you have to

60
00:04:15,24 --> 00:04:19,409
work SI of course,
be careful -- and we had a

61
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:23,412
length,
was 0 point six meters.

62
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:28,136
We had it several times out
here, and if you substitute

63
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:32,073
those numbers in there,
you will find that the

64
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:37,585
self-inductance of that solenoid
is 0 point 1 in SI units and we

65
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:40,559
call the SI units Henry,
capital H.

66
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:44,584
It would be the same as volt
seconds or ampere,

67
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,958
but no one would ever use that.
We call that Henry.

68
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:53,333
Every circuit has a finite
value for

69
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,765
the self-inductance,
however small that may be.

70
00:04:56,765 --> 00:05:01,167
Sometimes it's so small that we
ignore it, but if you take a

71
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,778
simple loop, a sum-,
simple current,

72
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:08,404
just one wire that goes around
-- whether it's this,a rectangle

73
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:12,731
or whether it is a circle it
doesn't make any difference --

74
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,343
it always produces a magnetic
field.

75
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:18,999
It always produces a magnetic
flux to the surface,

76
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:22,356
and so it always has a finite
self-inductance.

77
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:27,986
Maybe only nine nano Henrys,
maybe only micro Henrys,

78
00:05:27,986 --> 0.
but it's never zero.

79
0. --> 00:05:29,974
yes, there you see this,

80
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:35,37
And so now what I want to do is
to show you the remarkable

81
00:05:35,37 --> 00:05:41,05
consequences of the presence of
a self-inductor in a circuit,

82
00:05:41,05 --> 00:05:46,256
and I start very simple.
I have here a battery which has

83
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,718
EMFV.
I have here a switch,

84
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:54,493
and here are the self-inductor.
We always draw a self-inductor

85
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:59,983
in a circuit with these coils,
and we also have in series a

86
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:04,149
resistor, which we always
indicate with this,

87
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:07,935
these teeth.
And I close this switch when

88
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:12,006
there is no current running.
In other words,

89
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:16,171
a time T equals zero when I
close the switch,

90
00:06:16,171 --> 00:05:58,685
there is no current.
When I close the switch the

91
00:05:58,685 --> 00:05:14,056
current wants to increase,
but the self-inductance says

92
00:05:14,056 --> 00:04:50,915
uh-huh, uh-huh,
take it easy,

93
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:07,112
land slow, I don't like the
change of such occurrence.

94
00:04:07,112 --> 00:03:20,83
So the self-inductance is
fighting the current that wants

95
00:03:20,83 --> 00:02:44,466
to go through it.
There comes a time that the

96
00:02:44,466 --> 00:01:58,184
self-inductance loses the fight,
if you wait long enough,

97
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:09,422
and then of course the current
has reached a maximum volume,

98
00:01:09,422 --> 00:00:19,008
which you can find with Ohm's
Law, because the self-inductance

99
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:00
itself

100
00:00:00 --> 00:06:54

101
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58,265
has no resistor.
Think of the self-inductance as

102
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:01,26
made of super conducting
material.

103
00:07:01,26 --> 00:07:05,707
There's no resistance.
And so without knowing much

104
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:09,609
about physics,
you can make a plot about the

105
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:14,237
current that is going to flow as
a function of time.

106
00:07:14,237 --> 00:07:18,14
You start out with zero and
then ultimately,

107
00:07:18,14 --> 00:07:22,768
if you wait long enough,
you reach a maximum current

108
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:26,277
which is
given by Ohm's Law,

109
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:30,692
which is simply V divided by R.
And you slowly approach that

110
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:33,312
value.
And how slowly depends on the

111
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:37,727
value of the self-inductance.
If the self-inductance is very

112
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,992
high, it might climb up like
this, so this is a high value

113
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:44,686
for L.
If the self-inductance is very

114
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:47,305
low, then there's a low value
for L.

115
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:50,972
If the self-inductance were
zero, it would come up

116
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:54,339
instantaneously,
but I just convinced you that

117
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:39,696
there I no such thing as zero
self-inductance.

118
00:07:39,696 --> 00:06:40,673
There's always something
finite, no matter how small.

119
00:06:40,673 --> 00:05:32,57
And so this is qualitatively
what you would expect if you use

120
00:05:32,57 --> 00:04:36,952
your stomach and if you don't
use your brains yet.

121
00:04:36,952 --> 00:03:31,119
There's nothing wrong with
using your stomach occasionally,

122
00:03:31,119 --> 00:02:35,502
but now I want to do this in a
move civilized way,

123
00:02:35,502 --> 00:01:28,534
and I want to use my brains,
and when I use my brains I have

124
00:01:28,534 --> 00:00:46,537
to set up an equation for the
circuit.

125
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:00
And if you read your book,

126
00:00:00 --> 00:08:29

127
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32,792
you will find that Mister John
*Coley* tells you to use

128
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:36,514
*Kipshof's* Loop Rule.
But Mister John *Coley* doesn't

129
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:40,095
understand Faraday's Law,
and he's not the only one.

130
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:44,098
Almost every college book that
you read on physics do this

131
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:46,064
wrong.
They advise you to use

132
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:49,786
*Kipshof's* Loop Rule,
which says that the closed loop

133
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:52,244
integral around the circuit is
zero.

134
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:54,632
That, of course,
is utter nonsense.

135
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:57,932
How can it be zero?
Because there is a change in

136
00:08:57,932 --> 00:09:03,06
magnetic flux,
and so it can only be minus D

137
00:09:03,06 --> 00:09:06,84
five ET.
I advise you to go to the eight

138
00:09:06,84 --> 00:09:12,656
0 two website and download a
lecture supplement that you will

139
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:17,987
find in which I address this
issue and hit it very hard.

140
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:23,802
So the closed loop integral of
E dot EL, if you go around the

141
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:28,842
circuit, is not zero,
is minus D five ET -- Faraday's

142
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:34,367
Law -- so it's minus L the IDT.
So we have to go around to

143
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:38,806
circuits
and we have to apply Faraday's

144
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:43,341
law and not *Kipshof's* Loop
Rule, which doesn't apply here.

145
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:47,722
This is the plus side of the
battery and this is the minus

146
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:51,72
side, so the electric field in
the battery is in this

147
00:09:51,72 --> 00:09:54,41
direction.
The electric field in the

148
00:09:54,41 --> 00:09:58,792
self-inductance is zero because
the self-inductance has no

149
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:02,02
resistance, it's super
conducting material,

150
00:10:02,02 --> 00:10:06,555
and so the electric fields in
the resistor -- if the current

151
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:11,656
is in this direction,
which it will be -- then the

152
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:16,17
electric field in the resistor
will be in this direction.

153
00:10:16,17 --> 00:10:21,087
So now I am equipped to write
down the closed loop integral of

154
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,311
E dot VL.
I start here and I always go in

155
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:28,744
the direction of the current,
and I advise you to do the

156
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,484
same.
I don't care if you guess the

157
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:35,031
wrong direction for the current.
That's fine.

158
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:39,142
Later, minus signs will correct
that,

159
00:10:39,142 --> 00:09:21,899
they will tell you that you
really guessed the wrong

160
00:09:21,899 --> 00:07:46,482
direction, but always go around
the loop in the direction of the

161
00:07:46,482 --> 00:06:29,24
current, because then the EMF is
always minus LVIDT.

162
00:06:29,24 --> 00:05:15,027
If you go in the direction
opposed to the current,

163
00:05:15,027 --> 00:03:54,755
then it is plus LVIDT and that
could become confusing.

164
00:03:54,755 --> 00:02:45,086
So I always go in the direction
of the current,

165
00:02:45,086 --> 00:01:36,931
and so I first go through the
self-inductance.

166
00:01:36,931 --> 00:00:00
There is no electric field in
the self-inductance,

167
00:00:00 --> 00:11:10

168
00:11:10 --> 00:11:14,927
so the integral E dot EL -- in
going from here to here -- is

169
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:17,599
zero.
This is where the books are

170
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,019
wrong.
It is zero.

171
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,113
Now, I go through the resistor,
and so now I get plus IR E and

172
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:29,04
the L are in the same direction.
Ohm's Law tells me it's IR.

173
00:11:29,04 --> 00:11:32,38
In the battery,
I go against the electric

174
00:11:32,38 --> 00:11:36,806
fields, and so I get minus V.
That now equals minus L,

175
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:41,483
DIDT, and this is the only
thing and the only correct way

176
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:47,327
to apply
Faraday's Law in this circuit.

177
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:54,34
You can write it a little
differently, which may give you

178
00:11:54,34 --> 00:11:57,596
some insight.
For instance,

179
00:11:57,596 --> 00:12:03,106
you could write that I can
bring V and the L,

180
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:10,495
and L, to one side -- so I can
write down that V minus LDIDT

181
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:15,402
equals IR.
It's the same equation when you

182
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:19,82
look, and the nice thing about
writing it this way is that

183
00:12:19,82 --> 00:12:24,47
since the IDT is positive here
-- it's growing in time -- the

184
00:12:24,47 --> 00:12:29,274
induced EMF, which is this value
-- notice it's always opposing

185
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:34,157
the voltage of my battery -- and
that's what *Land's* Law is all

186
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:36,637
about.
It's not until the IDT has

187
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:40,202
become zero that V equals IR,
and that happens,

188
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:44
of course, if you wait long
enough.

189
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48,266
And so we have to solve the
differential equation,

190
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:53,665
and what is often done that you
bring all the terms to the left

191
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:57,845
side and that you get an,
zero on the right side.

192
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:02,547
And so what you often see is
that LVIDT plus IR minus V

193
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,856
equals zero.
And because we have a zero

194
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:10,82
here, some physicist thinks that
this is an application of

195
00:13:10,82 --> 00:13:15
*Kipshof's* Rule.
This is nonsense.

196
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18,658
You can always make it zero
here by bringing all the terms

197
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:21,354
to this side.
The closed loop integral of E

198
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:24,434
DEL TL is not zero,
the closed loop integral of E

199
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:27,836
DEL TL is minus LDIDT,
but when I shift minus LDIDT to

200
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:31,302
this side I get zero here.
And of course the people who

201
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:35,345
write these books know that this
is the right answer and so they

202
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:39,004
manipulate it so they get this
equation and they call that

203
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,828
*Kipshof's* Rule.
Sad, and also embarrassing.

204
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:46
So, this is the equation that
you have to solve.

205
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49,826
Some of you may have solved
this equation in eight 0 one

206
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:52,26
already.
Surely you didn't have an I

207
00:13:52,26 --> 00:13:54,695
here.
You may have had an X here for

208
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:57,617
the position,
but you probably solved it or

209
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,982
you had friction.
Maybe you didn't.

210
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:04,017
I will give you the solution to
that differential equation.

211
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:07,773
It's a very easy solution.
The current as a function of

212
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:11,6
time is a maximum value times
one minus E to the minus R

213
00:14:11,6 --> 00:14:16,399
divided by L times T,
and IMX -- that is the maximum

214
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,489
current -- is V divided by R.
And let's look at this in a

215
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:25,852
little bit more detail.
First, notice that when T

216
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:30,032
equals zero that indeed you find
I equals zero.

217
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:34,94
Substituting here T equals
zero, you get one minus one.

218
00:14:34,94 --> 00:14:38,485
So you find,
indeed, that I equals zero.

219
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:43,756
Substituting there T goes to
infinity, then you find that I

220
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:49,668
indeed becomes V divided by R,
which is exactly what you

221
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:51,993
expect.
If T becomes infinity,

222
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:55,52
then clearly the
self-inductance has lost all

223
00:14:55,52 --> 00:14:59,608
it's power, so to speak,
and the current is simply V

224
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,894
divided by R,
the maximum current that you

225
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:05,299
can have.
And so that's a must,

226
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:09,467
that's a requirement.
If you wait L over R seconds --

227
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:12,994
and believe it or not,
if you have some time,

228
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:18,284
convince yourself that L over R
indeed, as a unit,

229
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:24,023
is seconds -- then the current
I is about sixty three percent

230
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:29,665
of IMX, because if T is L over
R, then you get one minus one

231
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:33,682
divided by E,
and that is about 0 point six

232
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,838
three.
And if you wait double this

233
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:42,384
time, then you have about eighty
six percent of the maximum

234
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:44,584
current.
In other words,

235
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:48,888
right here -- if I wait L over
R

236
00:15:48,888 --> 00:12:55,274
seconds -- this value here is
about 0 point six three times

237
00:12:55,274 --> 00:10:52,547
the maximum value possible,
and it's very,

238
00:10:52,547 --> 00:08:19,887
it's climbing up and
asymptotically approaches then,

239
00:08:19,887 --> 00:05:35,253
ultimately, the maximum current
which is V divided by R.

240
00:05:35,253 --> 00:02:44,633
Make sure you download that
lecture supplement that you'll

241
00:02:44,633 --> 00:00:00
find on the Web.
Now, what I'm going to do is

242
00:00:00 --> 00:16:18

243
00:16:18 --> 00:13:52,157
all of a sudden I'm going to
make this voltage zero.

244
00:13:52,157 --> 00:11:23,456
The way I could do that is by
simply shorting it out.

245
00:11:23,456 --> 00:08:57,614
Of course on the blackboard,
I can simply remove it.

246
00:08:57,614 --> 00:06:46,07
So it's not there.
The current is still running

247
00:06:46,07 --> 00:04:43,105
and all of a sudden at a new
time -- T zero,

248
00:04:43,105 --> 00:02:11,543
I define the time T zero again
-- the voltage is zero.

249
00:02:11,543 --> 00:00:00
And now comes the question what
is

250
00:00:00 --> 00:16:48

251
00:16:48 --> 00:14:40,225
now going to happen?
Well, the self-inductance

252
00:14:40,225 --> 00:12:12,574
doesn't like the fact that the
current is going down,

253
00:12:12,574 --> 00:09:30,726
so it's going to fight that
change, and so you expect that

254
00:09:30,726 --> 00:07:20,112
the current is not going to die
off right away,

255
00:07:20,112 --> 00:04:21,228
but you expect that the current
is going to go down sort of like

256
00:04:21,228 --> 00:03:35,797
so.
And you want,

257
00:03:35,797 --> 00:01:42,219
when you wait long enough,
you want that,

258
00:01:42,219 --> 00:00:00
at T goes to infinity,

259
00:00:00 --> 00:17:19

260
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22,928
where T equals zero the current
is still maximum,

261
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:27,265
so it's still V over R,
but when you go to infinity --

262
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:32,258
if you wait long enough -- then,
of course, the current has to

263
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:35,531
become zero.
And as the current dies out,

264
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:40,606
heat is being produced in that
resistor at a rate of I square R

265
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:44,289
joules per second,
and then there comes a time

266
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:49,363
that the current becomes almost
zero and then the whole show is

267
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:53,687
over.
And so we can also calculate

268
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:59,062
the exact time behavior by going
back to our differential

269
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:03,958
equation and make V zero.
Where is that differential

270
00:18:03,958 --> 0.
equation?

271
0. --> 00:18:04,917
yes, there you see this,

272
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,701
Is it hiding?
Oh, there it is.

273
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:13,46
So I solved this differential
equation, but this is now zero.

274
00:18:13,46 --> 00:18:18,739
And the solution to that
differential equation is that I

275
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:24,499
as a function of time is IMX
times E to

276
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:29,126
the minus R over L times T,
and that exactly has all the

277
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:34,175
quantities that you want it to
have, because notice that at T

278
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:39,307
equals zero -- when you put in T
equals zero -- the current is

279
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:42,925
indeed maximum,
and that's what you require.

280
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:47,217
That's the moment that you make
that capital V zero,

281
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:52,265
the current was still running.
But notice that when T goes to

282
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:56,822
infinity --
if you wait long enough -- that

283
00:18:56,822 --> 00:19:01,406
indeed the current goes to zero.
And if you wait L over R

284
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:06,154
seconds, then you are down to
about thirty seven percent of

285
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:09,674
your maximum current.
So if you now go to I,

286
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:14,258
I re-define T equals zero here,
so if now I wait L over R

287
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:19,17
seconds then this value here is
about thirty seven percent of

288
00:19:19,17 --> 00:19:22,199
that value.
So you've lost sixty three

289
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:25,085
percent.
And so you see,

290
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:29,573
this is the consequence of the
fact that the circuit is capable

291
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:33,409
of fighting its own magnetic
flux that it is creating.

292
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:36,377
When the current was running
happily here,

293
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:39,417
with the battery in place,
the current was,

294
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:43,543
let's say, all the time IMX --
at least very close to that

295
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:46,293
value -- V over R.
And so all the time,

296
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:49,116
there was heat produced in the
resistor.

297
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:52,88
I square R joules per second.
Who was providing that,

298
00:19:52,88 --> 00:19:54,835
uh, energy?
Well, of course,

299
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:57,082
the
battery.

300
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:00,797
But now, when I take the
battery out, there is still

301
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:03,711
current running,
and that means while the

302
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,227
current is dying there is still
heat produced in that resistor,

303
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:12,452
and that heat slowly comes out
until the current ultimately

304
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:15,657
becomes zero.
Now where does that energy come

305
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:18,279
from?
Well that energy must come from

306
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,921
the magnetic field that is
present in the solenoid,

307
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:26,073
and this idea -- that we have
energy that comes out in the

308
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:31,102
form of heat,
which really was there ear-,

309
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:36,444
earlier in the form of a
magnetic field -- allows us to

310
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:41,885
evaluate what we call the
magnetic energy field density.

311
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:48,018
Let me first calculate how much
heat is produced as the current

312
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:51,778
goes from a maximum value down
to zero.

313
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:55,24
Hmmmm, I'll have to erase
something.

314
00:20:55,24 --> 00:21:01,779
I'll erase this part here.
So at any moment in time,

315
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:06,781
the current is producing heat
in the resistor,

316
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:11,339
and so if I,
if my voltage becomes zero at

317
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:16,342
time T equals zero,
then this is the amount of

318
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:20,899
heat, uh-uh, no square here.
I square RDT,

319
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:27,014
integrated from zero to
infinity, is the total heat that

320
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:31,713
is produced
as the current dies out,

321
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:36,356
but I know what this current
was -- I just erased it,

322
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:41,803
if I still remember it -- so I
can bring IMX outside and I can

323
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:47,517
bring the resistance outside and
the I get the integral from zero

324
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:51,803
to infinity of E to the minus R
over L times TDT.

325
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:56,089
And this is a trivial integral.
This integral is,

326
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:59,571
uhm, L divided by two R.
Oh, by the way,

327
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:04,331
it is I squared,
so I have a two here.

328
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:08,394
It's very important.
Don't forget the two.

329
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:12,556
And so that integral is L
divided by two R,

330
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:18,304
and so if now I look at the
product of I square maximum R L

331
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:22,367
divided by two R,
I get one half L times I

332
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:26,826
maximum squared.
So this comes out in the form

333
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:32,772
of heat, and IMX is then the
maximum current that we had when

334
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:38,196
the current
was flowing after a long time.

335
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:41,829
I can now by,
by manipulating numbers,

336
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:47,526
I can now calculate how much
energy there was in that field

337
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:52,043
per cubic meter,
because the magnetic field was

338
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:55,186
exclusively inside that
solenoid.

339
00:22:55,186 --> 00:23:01,177
And if I know that the energy
that is ultimately coming out is

340
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:06,284
one half LI squared,
then I have here I,

341
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:10,079
and so I can replace that I
there by B divided by new zero

342
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,61
times L divided by N and here I
have L.

343
00:23:12,61 --> 00:23:16,672
And so if I substitute in here
the value for L that we have on

344
00:23:16,672 --> 00:23:19,869
the blackboard there,
and we substitute for I the

345
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:23,997
value that we have here -- you
can drop the maximum now -- this

346
00:23:23,997 --> 00:23:27,061
simply tells you,
then, that any moment in time

347
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:30,39
that I have a current I running
through a solenoid,

348
00:23:30,39 --> 00:23:34,053
that the energy that is
available in the solenoid in the

349
00:23:34,053 --> 00:22:15,681
forms of magnetic energy is one
half LR squared.

350
00:22:15,681 --> 00:17:50,584
And so when you do that,
you substitute capital L and

351
00:17:50,584 --> 00:12:39,605
capital I, you will find that
one half LI squared then becomes

352
00:12:39,605 --> 00:07:43,919
B squared over two new zero
times pi little R squared times

353
00:07:43,919 --> 00:05:36,469
L.
You check that at home.

354
00:05:36,469 --> 00:00:00
It's simply a substitution.
But this is the volume of the

355
00:00:00 --> 00:24:07

356
00:24:07 --> 00:24:10,485
solenoid where the magnetic
field exists,

357
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:14,843
and we have assumed that the
magnetic field is zero

358
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:18,503
everywhere outside.
And if you accept that,

359
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:23,732
then you see that we now have a
result for the magnetic field

360
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:28,874
energy density -- that is how
much energy there is per cubic

361
00:24:28,874 --> 00:24:32,272
meter -- that is,
of course, this value.

362
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:38,199
Because this is the total
energy of the magnetic field,

363
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:41,842
if we know the current,
and this is the volume of the

364
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:43,874
magnetic field.
So the magne-,

365
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:48,148
magnetic field energy density
is then B squared divided by two

366
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:51,441
new zero, and this is in joules
per cubic meter.

367
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:54,664
So in principle,
if you knew the magnetic field

368
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:58,237
everywhere in space,
then you can integrate over all

369
00:24:58,237 --> 00:25:01,81
space and you can then calculate
how much energy is,

370
00:25:01,81 --> 00:25:04,193
uhm, present in the magnetic
field.

371
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:08,046
And earlier in this course,
we did something similar for

372
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:12,474
electric fields.
We calculated the electric

373
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:16,121
field energy density.
Perhaps you remember whatit

374
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:18,553
was.
It was one half epsilon zero

375
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:22,58
kappa times E squared.
It was also in joules per cubic

376
00:25:22,58 --> 00:25:25,315
meter.
Now in the case of an electric

377
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:30,026
field, this represents the work
that I had to do to arrange the

378
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:32,61
charges in a certain
configuration.

379
00:25:32,61 --> 00:25:36,713
In the case of a magnetic
field, it represents the work

380
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:41,5
that I have to do to get a
current going inside

381
00:25:41,5 --> 00:25:45,762
a pure self-inductor.
That means the resistance of

382
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:50,547
the self-inductor is zero,
and it takes work because the

383
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:54,984
solenoid will oppose the
building up of the current,

384
00:25:54,984 --> 00:25:59,681
and so I have to do work.
So there's a parallel between

385
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:02,03
the two.
I can make you see,

386
00:26:02,03 --> 00:26:06,815
in a quite dramatic way,
how strong self-inductances can

387
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:11,252
fight their own current,
and the way I'm going to do

388
00:26:11,252 --> 00:24:07,312
that is
with in-, inside of there,

389
00:24:07,312 --> 00:19:16,882
whereby I have a twelve volt
car battery and I have two light

390
00:19:16,882 --> 00:16:56,507
bulbs.
I have here an enormous

391
00:16:56,507 --> 00:14:26,451
self-inductance L,
thirty Henry.

392
00:14:26,451 --> 00:09:50,542
We will learn later in the
course how you make such a high

393
00:09:50,542 --> 00:06:07,878
self-inductance,
and then here is a light bulb.

394
00:06:07,878 --> 00:02:44,577
The light bulb has a resistance
of six ohm.

395
00:02:44,577 --> 00:00:00
This self-inductance,

396
00:00:00 --> 00:26:45

397
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47,909
there is nothing we can do
about it.

398
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,068
It happens to have four ohm
resistance.

399
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,227
We don't have a self,
we don't have s-,

400
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:58,965
superconducting wires here,
so it also has a resistance of

401
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,207
four ohms.
Forgive me for that but there

402
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:07,112
is nothing I can do about it.
I have here another resistance

403
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:11,933
of our ohms and a light bulb,
which is the same one as that

404
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:17,004
one -- also six ohms -- and then
here is my car battery plus a

405
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:21,152
switch.
And the car battery is twelve

406
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:25,011
volts, and I'm going to throw
the switch, turn it on.

407
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:28,574
You will see that this light
bulb comes on almost

408
00:27:28,574 --> 00:27:31,988
instantaneously.
There is no self-inductance in

409
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:35,625
this loop -- well,
maybe a few micro Henry or even

410
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:39,114
less -- but in this loop here
there is this huge

411
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:42,602
self-inductance,
and so the self-inductance says

412
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:45,645
take it easy to the current,
take it easy,

413
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:50,098
just wait, and you will very
slowly see that

414
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:54,093
light bulb come on.
And we can calculate how long

415
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:59,002
it takes, because we have here
ten ohms -- six ohms and four

416
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:03,412
ohms, so L divided by R,
we have thirty divided by ten

417
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:08,321
-- so that is three seconds.
So what that means is that even

418
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:11,899
after six seconds,
which is twice this time,

419
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:16,808
even then the current through
this light bulb is only eighty

420
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:22,799
six percentof it's maximum.
But that means since the light,

421
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,305
of course, is proportional to I
square R in the light bulb,

422
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:29,569
that the light is only seventy
five percent of maximum,

423
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:32,772
and even if you wait nine
seconds, then the light that

424
00:28:32,772 --> 00:28:36,338
comes out here is still only
ninety percent of it's maximum,

425
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:38,575
whereas this one comes on
immediately.

426
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:42,201
The reason why we put the four
ohm here, we want this part to

427
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:45,949
be -- from an ohmic resistance
point of view -- to be identical

428
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:48,547
as this part.
So that's why you artificially

429
00:28:48,547 --> 00:28:51,811
added here the four ohm,
because the four ohm is always

430
00:28:51,811 --> 00:27:06,812
there in the self-inductance,
there is nothing we can do

431
00:27:06,812 --> 00:24:29,111
about it.
And so you are going to see a

432
00:24:29,111 --> 00:21:34,809
remarkable example.
This is one light bulb.

433
00:21:34,809 --> 00:17:25,807
That is the one that is here,
and this is the light bulb that

434
00:17:25,807 --> 00:14:27,356
is there, and the
self-inductance is in this

435
00:14:27,356 --> 00:12:47,755
incredible monster,
here.

436
00:12:47,755 --> 00:09:32,704
I'll make the lights,
change the light setting a

437
00:09:32,704 --> 00:05:56,902
little bit so that we can see
the lights of the bulb.

438
00:05:56,902 --> 00:02:16,951
The bulbs are only eight-watt
bulbs, they're not very,

439
00:02:16,951 --> 00:00:00
very strong,
not

440
00:00:00 --> 00:29:25

441
00:29:25 --> 00:29:28,492
very bright bulbs,
but the effect will be very

442
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:31,286
clear.
So if you're ready for this --

443
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:35,322
so this is the one that I think
comes on immediately,

444
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:39,125
and this is the one that takes
it's time -- three,

445
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,531
two, one, zero.
One, two, three,

446
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:44,092
four, five, six,
you see how slow?

447
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:48,361
It's still not very bright,
it's still getting brighter.

448
00:29:48,361 --> 00:29:51,155
It's still not as bright as
this one.

449
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:55,036
It's getting there,
you can actually do some timing

450
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:57,397
by
counting.

451
00:29:57,397 --> 00:30:02,19
By the way, the values of the
resistance that I gave you are

452
00:30:02,19 --> 00:30:05,845
when the light bulbs are hot.
Three, two, one,

453
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,039
zero, one, two,
three, four,

454
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,395
five, six, seven,
eight, nine,

455
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:13,563
ten, eleven,
twelve, I'm still seeing it

456
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:17,219
getting brighter.
What you're seeing here is a

457
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:21,605
remarkable example that the
self-inductance is fighting

458
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:23,718
itself.
That's why the name

459
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:27,918
self-inductance
is so nice.

460
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:35,651
Now I want to go one step
further and I want to power the

461
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:40,208
LR circuit with a AC power
supply.

462
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:48,079
If you have an AC power supply
-- so it's changing all the

463
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:55,674
time, the voltage -- now,
of course, the self-inductance

464
00:30:55,674 --> 00:31:00,07
is
fighting back all the time,

465
00:31:00,07 --> 00:31:05,85
not just only in the beginning
as you saw in this circuit,

466
00:31:05,85 --> 00:31:10,515
but now, of course,
it is active almost all the

467
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:13,861
time.
So we can do away with this,

468
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:19,337
and so now we replace the
battery by a AC power supply,

469
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:23,495
which we normally put just a
wiggle there,

470
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:31
and here is the self-inductance
L, and here is the resistor R.

471
00:31:31 --> 00:31:36,907
And let the voltage provided by
this power supply be V zero

472
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:42,101
times the cosine of omega T,
omega being the angular

473
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:45,564
frequency.
And now, I have to apply

474
00:31:45,564 --> 00:31:49,332
Faraday's Law,
not *Kipshof's* Rule --

475
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:55,24
Faraday's Law -- when I go
around this circuit and I set up

476
00:31:55,24 --> 00:32:02,165
the differential equation.
And of course the differential

477
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:06,722
equation is going to be exactly
like this, except that V,

478
00:32:06,722 --> 00:32:10,139
now, is V zero times the cosine
of omega T.

479
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:14,533
And now I have to solve for
this differential equation.

480
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:19,09
That's the only difference,
so I don't have to start from

481
00:32:19,09 --> 00:32:22,019
ground zero.
And the solution to this

482
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:27,063
differential equation is quite
remarkable and not so intuitive.

483
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:32,027
The current -- as a function of
time, now -- is V zero divided

484
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:36,664
by the square root of R squared
plus omega

485
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:41,319
L squared times the cosine of
omega T minus phi,

486
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,082
and the tangent of phi,
that angle phi,

487
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:50,529
is omega L divided by R.
And of course we need some time

488
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:55,085
to digest this.
The first thing that you notice

489
00:32:55,085 --> 00:33:00,532
is that there is a phase lag
between the current and the

490
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:06,375
driving voltage.
If phi, as you're going to see,

491
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:10,065
is, uhm, ninety degrees,
then the current is delayed by

492
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:13,277
one quarter of a cycle,
though the fact that the

493
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,967
current comes later than the
driving voltage perhaps is

494
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:20,589
intuitive, because the
self-inductance is fighting the

495
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:23,596
change in the current.
So it's perhaps not so

496
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:27,696
surprising that there's going to
be a delay, that the current

497
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:31,044
comes a little later.
If you look at this equation

498
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:34,735
here, then what you have in
front of the cosine term is

499
00:33:34,735 --> 00:32:09,621
obviously the maximum
possible current,

500
00:32:09,621 --> 00:26:44,578
because the cosine term is just
oscillating between plus one and

501
00:26:44,578 --> 00:21:24,694
minus one, and so this here is
the maximum current that you can

502
00:21:24,694 --> 00:18:29,274
ever get.
In one full cycle you get

503
00:18:29,274 --> 00:15:08,057
positive and you get negative
net value.

504
00:15:08,057 --> 00:10:03,651
And notice here the role of
omega L really plays the role of

505
00:10:03,651 --> 00:06:32,115
a resistance,
and in fact the dimension of

506
00:06:32,115 --> 00:03:47,014
omega L is ome-,
is, is, is ohms.

507
00:03:47,014 --> 00:00:00
It really plays the role of a

508
00:00:00 --> 00:34:07

509
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11,081
resistance, and if omega is
very high then the resistance

510
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:15,382
here becomes very high and so
your current becomes very low.

511
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:19,172
Well, that's intuitively
pleasing because if omega is

512
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:22,671
high, then the changes -- the
DIDT's -- are very,

513
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:26,899
very high, and therefore if
there are very fast changes the

514
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:31,491
induced EMF is going to be high,
and so the current will be low.

515
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:35,5
Also, if L is very high,
then the system also is capable

516
00:34:35,5 --> 00:34:39,291
of fighting back very hard,
and so it puts up a large

517
00:34:39,291 --> 00:32:25
resistance.
So it's also pleasing that you

518
00:32:25 --> 00:30:22,301
see the L there,
downstairs.

519
00:30:22,301 --> 00:26:25,993
If omega is very low,
in your mind you can make omega

520
00:26:25,993 --> 00:23:42,395
zero.
You don't even have alternating

521
00:23:42,395 --> 00:19:46,086
current when omega is zero,
then you have DC which is

522
00:19:46,086 --> 00:16:30,677
direct current.
So when you make omega zero,

523
00:16:30,677 --> 00:13:33,446
you simply get I is V zero
divided by R.

524
00:13:33,446 --> 00:10:13,493
That's Ohm's Law,
that's obvious that you get

525
00:10:13,493 --> 00:07:48,072
that.
Let's now look at the phase

526
00:07:48,072 --> 00:05:09,018
angle.
The tangent of phi is omega L

527
00:05:09,018 --> 00:02:02,698
divided by R.
If the self-inductor is very

528
00:02:02,698 --> 00:00:00
large,

529
00:00:00 --> 00:35:14

530
00:35:14 --> 00:35:17,897
then the system has a strong
ability to fight back,

531
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:21,483
so it can delay that current by
a large amount,

532
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:24,368
and the same is true is omega
is high.

533
00:35:24,368 --> 00:35:28,032
If omega is high then the time
changes are very,

534
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:32,553
changes occur on a very small
time scale, and so the system

535
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:35,048
can fight back.
Because remember,

536
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:38,556
you always have the EMF
proportion to the IDT.

537
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:42,609
And so it's also pleasing to
see that omega and L are

538
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:45,883
upstairs here.
Either one of being large it

539
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:50,215
can
fight back and it can hold back

540
00:35:50,215 --> 0.
the, the current.

541
0. --> 00:35:51,734
yes, there you see this,

542
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:56,882
I have worked out a situation
whereby we have an LR circuit --

543
00:35:56,882 --> 00:36:00,848
this is on the Web,
you can download that so you

544
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:06,081
don't have to copy it -- and the
reason why I have these values

545
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:11,144
is because directly coupled to a
demonstration that I will do

546
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:14,436
shortly.
You see, an L in series with an

547
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:19,5
R, the L is ten *milli-Henry*
and the R

548
00:36:19,5 --> 00:32:58,16
is ten ohms,
and let V zero be ten volts.

549
00:32:58,16 --> 00:28:56,553
And here you see three
frequencies hundred hertz,

550
00:28:56,553 --> 00:24:34,811
thousand and ten thousand
hertz, and here you see the

551
00:24:34,811 --> 00:20:33,204
values for omega.
You have to multiply hertz with

552
00:20:33,204 --> 00:17:57,166
two pi.
And look now at omega L.

553
00:17:57,166 --> 00:13:05,224
At low frequency -- a hundred
hertz -- omega L is six point

554
00:13:05,224 --> 00:09:33,817
three ohms.
Compare that with the ten ohms.

555
00:09:33,817 --> 00:05:27,176
They'd be comparable,
but now look for instance at

556
00:05:27,176 --> 00:02:10,87
ten thousand hertz.
The omega L is huge.

557
00:02:10,87 --> 00:00:00
It's six

558
00:00:00 --> 00:36:51

559
00:36:51 --> 00:36:54,587
hundred and thirty ohms.
So it entirely determines -- so

560
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,326
to speak -- the resistance of
that circuit.

561
00:36:57,326 --> 00:37:01,109
And so the current that is
going to run -- at least this is

562
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:04,957
the maximum current is this
value, which we also saw here on

563
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:09,001
the blackboard -- that current
at high frequently is enormously

564
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,284
reduced.
It's fifty times lower than

565
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:15,197
this current at low frequency,
even though they have the same

566
00:37:15,197 --> 00:37:18,328
value for P zero.
And then you see here the phase

567
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:20,545
angles.
And the reason why you have

568
00:37:20,545 --> 00:37:23,858
these
values is that I can make you

569
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,269
listen to this,
I can make you hear this,

570
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:29,283
because your hearing is very
good at hundred hertz,

571
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:32,899
and since all of you are young
you can probably hear even ten

572
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:35,672
thousand hertz,
maybe some of you can even hear

573
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:38,324
twenty kilohertz.
When you get older you lose

574
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:41,398
your high frequencies.
In fact, my frequency cut off

575
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:43,628
is somewhere near four thousand
hertz.

576
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:47,425
I'm going to make you listen to
music, and there will be violins

577
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:50,74
which produce probably three,
four, five thousand hertz,

578
00:37:50,74 --> 00:37:53,474
and then
I will turn on,

579
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:56,125
all of a sudden,
the ten *milli-Henry*.

580
00:37:56,125 --> 00:38:00,52
So first I will make you listen
to music whereby there is no ten

581
00:38:00,52 --> 00:38:04,287
*milli-Henry* in there,
and then I will turn on the ten

582
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:06,868
*milli-Henry*,
and what you will hear,

583
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,915
that the violins disappear
because the current reduction is

584
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:15,031
now huge on the high frequency
but is very little on the low

585
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:19,216
frequency, and that's the idea
of what a self-inductor can do

586
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:21,449
for you.
So if you listen to this

587
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:27,815
[playback
of classical music with violin]

588
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:35,768
there's no self-inductor in now.
There's no music either

589
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:41,841
[laughter] OK.
[Playback of classical music

590
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:47,047
continues, without violin
notes.] OK.

591
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:55
It's different music.
No self-inductor.

592
00:38:55 --> 00:38:59,973
[Click] Self-inductor.
The high frequencies are gone.

593
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:05,33
[Playback of classical music
continues, again with violin

594
00:39:05,33 --> 00:39:10,4
notes] No self-inductor.
[Click] You can turn a violin

595
00:39:10,4 --> 00:39:14,417
concerto into a cello concerto.
[laughter].

596
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:17,478
You just cut the violins out.
OK.

597
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:23,121
I cannot make you listen to the
phase shift, not even in the

598
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:28
case of the ninety degree phase
shift,

599
00:39:28 --> 00:39:31,242
and that is quite obvious
because what does it mean that

600
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:33,364
there is a ninety degree phase
shift?

601
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:36,902
It means that during one cycle
of ten thousand hertz -- which

602
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:40,262
takes only one ten-thousandth of
a second -- that the high

603
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:43,563
frequencies are shifted by only
twenty-five microseconds,

604
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:46,983
and there's no way that your
ears, your ears can hear that.

605
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:50,343
The fact that the composer
wanted those violins to come in

606
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:54,057
twenty-five microseconds earlier
than, than they do of course is

607
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:57,359
something you cannot hear.
So I cannot make you listen to

608
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,25
the phase shift,
but for the phase shift I have

609
00:40:01,25 --> 00:40:05,581
something else.
And for that something else,

610
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:10,214
I'm going to return to the,
to my last lecture,

611
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:15,452
in which we levitated a woman
-- magnetic levitation.

612
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:21,193
And so I'm going to return to
that idea and grind a little

613
00:40:21,193 --> 00:40:25,524
deeper than we did when I gave
that lecture,

614
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:31,064
just before spring break.
I had a coil and I was driving

615
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:36
that coal, coil with sixty hertz
AC.

616
00:40:36 --> 00:34:17,347
And let's assume that looking
from above that the current was

617
00:34:17,347 --> 00:27:46,072
running in clockwise direction,
which is exactly what I assumed

618
00:27:46,072 --> 00:22:05,284
when I discussed with you,
and so the magnetic field is

619
00:22:05,284 --> 00:17:02,362
coming down like this --
magnetic dipole field --

620
00:17:02,362 --> 00:12:24,683
produced by this coil.
And then we have here,

621
00:12:24,683 --> 00:06:06,031
we had a conducting place under
there, and I said to you when

622
00:06:06,031 --> 00:00:00
this magnetic field is
increasing in strength,

623
00:00:00 --> 00:41:06

624
00:41:06 --> 00:41:09,116
then there's going to be an
induced EMF here,

625
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:11,879
which tries to imp-,
oppose that change,

626
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:15,208
and so the induced current that
is going to run,

627
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:18,82
which we call eddy currents,
is going to run in this

628
00:41:18,82 --> 00:41:21,016
direction.
If this is clockwise,

629
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:24,204
this current is going to be
counter clockwise,

630
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:27,604
so it's going to produce a
magnetic field in this

631
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:30,295
direction.
It opposes the change of the

632
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:33,058
increase in magnetic field:
*Lendz* Law.

633
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:36,741
And since the two currents are
in opposite direction,

634
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:41,665
the two repel each other.
And you bought off on that,

635
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,935
and we levitated a woman.
However, no one asked me the

636
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:48,76
question, what happens a little
later in time when the magnetic

637
00:41:48,76 --> 00:41:52,523
field is still in the downward
direction but it is decreasing,

638
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:55,793
since it is an AC current,
there comes a time that the

639
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:58,322
magnetic field will be
decreasing in time.

640
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:01,777
Now the EMF here must flip over
because Lendz says sorry,

641
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:05,231
we don't like the decrease.
The moment that the EMF flips

642
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,267
over, this current will flip
over.

643
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:10,599
The two currents are now in the
same

644
00:42:10,599 --> 00:37:10,002
direction, and they will
attract each other,

645
00:37:10,002 --> 00:32:16,397
and so there goes your magnetic
levitation.

646
00:32:16,397 --> 00:25:58,904
Half the time attraction,
half the time they repel each

647
00:25:58,904 --> 00:21:40,252
other.
But yet we did elev- levitate a

648
00:21:40,252 --> 00:15:57,712
woman, and the secret lies in
the self-inductance.

649
00:15:57,712 --> 00:09:33,229
This current that runs here
runs over a pass -- which is

650
00:09:33,229 --> 00:03:50,689
very difficult for me to
anticipate -- which has a

651
00:03:50,689 --> 00:00:00
certain resistance,

652
00:00:00 --> 00:42:42

653
00:42:42 --> 00:42:45,405
R; and it has a certain
self-inductance,

654
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:47,5
L.
We know what omega is;

655
00:42:47,5 --> 00:42:50,294
that's about three hundred
sixty.

656
00:42:50,294 --> 00:42:55,009
And so we do get in this
conductor, we get the current,

657
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:59,549
the induced current here,
is delayed by a phase angle

658
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:04,002
driven by this equation,
is delayed over the induced

659
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:06,971
EMF.
The EMF immediately coupled to

660
00:43:06,971 --> 00:43:11,336
what this coil is doing,
but the induced current is

661
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:14,654
delayed.
And I have something that will

662
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:19,528
allow
that, allow you to see that,

663
00:43:19,528 --> 00:43:24,59
perhaps in even more detail.
This *raf* curve is the

664
00:43:24,59 --> 00:43:29,353
current for the coil,
the coil that you see there

665
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:32,827
above.
And when the current is above

666
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:38,682
the black line it's clockwise
and when it is below the black

667
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:43,743
line it's counter clockwise.
The vertical scales are

668
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:49,5
arbitrary.
The green curve is the EMF,

669
00:43:49,5 --> 00:43:51,991
which is induced in the
conductor.

670
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:56,673
Notice when the magnetic field
increases, when the current goes

671
00:43:56,673 --> 00:43:59,996
up in the coil,
that the EMF in the conductor

672
00:43:59,996 --> 00:44:04,225
is in such a direction that it
opposes the change of that

673
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:07,245
magnetic field.
But now when the magnetic

674
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:10,493
fields go down,
when the current in the coil

675
00:44:10,493 --> 00:44:15,175
goes down, immediately the EMF
flips over, which is what I just

676
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:18,573
mentioned to you,
and therefore if the induced

677
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:22,5
current and the induced EMF were
in

678
00:44:22,5 --> 00:44:26,673
phase with each other,
half the time you would have

679
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:31,764
attraction and half the time you
would have that the two repel

680
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:36,355
each other, and that won't give
you magnetic levitation.

681
00:44:36,355 --> 00:44:40,862
Here, what you see is a blue
curve which represents the

682
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:44,451
induced current.
I call it the eddy current.

683
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:49,208
If there is no phase shift
between the induced EMF and the

684
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:53,798
induced current,
notice that half the time

685
00:44:53,798 --> 00:44:57,784
the blue curve and the red
curve are in opposite direction.

686
00:44:57,784 --> 00:45:01,7
When they are in opposite
direction they repel each other.

687
00:45:01,7 --> 00:45:05,273
When they are in the same
direction they attract each

688
00:45:05,273 --> 00:45:07,471
other.
But now, if I have a phase

689
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:11,388
delay so that the induced
current comes later than the EMF

690
00:45:11,388 --> 00:45:15,716
-- and I'm going to do something
dramatic, I'm going to shift it

691
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:19,908
by ninety degrees so the current
is now ninety degrees delayed

692
00:45:19,908 --> 00:45:24,929
relative to the induced EMF --
look now that the red curve and

693
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:27,854
the blue curve are always in
opposite direction.

694
00:45:27,854 --> 00:45:31,464
And so now there is hundred
percent of the time a repelling

695
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:33,643
force.
The coil repels the conductor

696
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,697
and the conductor repels the
coil.

697
00:45:35,697 --> 00:45:38,373
Now in the case when we
levitated the woman,

698
00:45:38,373 --> 00:45:42,232
I am sure that the phase delay
was not ninety degrees but maybe

699
00:45:42,232 --> 00:45:45,78
it was only thirty or forty
degrees, but the net result is

700
00:45:45,78 --> 00:45:49,452
here the shift is not ninety
degrees, the net result is that

701
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:53
you get, on average,
a repelling force.

702
00:45:53 --> 00:45:55,905
And so, the secret of the
repelling force,

703
00:45:55,905 --> 00:46:00,016
in the case of the levitation
of this coil and therefore of

704
00:46:00,016 --> 00:46:04,055
the levitation of the woman,
lies in the effect that there

705
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:07,67
is a finite self-inductance
[tapping noise] in here.

706
00:46:07,67 --> 00:46:10,717
If R is zero,
then of course we have a super

707
00:46:10,717 --> 00:46:13,977
conductor, then *phi* is always
ninety degrees.

708
00:46:13,977 --> 00:46:16,741
When R is zero,
this is infinitely high,

709
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:20,498
so now we get a ninety-degree
phase shift, and I did a

710
00:46:20,498 --> 00:46:25,373
demonstration whereby I
had a little magnet floating

711
00:46:25,373 --> 00:46:28,799
above a super conductor.
That was an ideal case.

712
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:32,663
Phi was then ninety degrees,
so they always repel each

713
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:34,922
other.
Today I want to do a more

714
00:46:34,922 --> 00:46:38,348
controlled demonstration,
whereby I can actually

715
00:46:38,348 --> 00:46:42,503
calculate the self-inductance
and I also can calculate the

716
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:45,419
resistance.
And what I will do today is I

717
00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:49,355
will have a coil which is
stationary, and I will have a

718
00:46:49,355 --> 00:46:53
conductor which is not
stationary.

719
00:46:53 --> 00:46:55,906
Here is my coil.
AC, sixty hertz.

720
00:46:55,906 --> 00:46:59,084
There's the coil.
And I have a ring,

721
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:04,08
and the ring is made of
aluminum, and I know exactly the

722
00:47:04,08 --> 00:47:09,075
dimensions of this ring.
I know the radius -- it's about

723
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:14,433
five centimeters -- I know the
thickness, I know everything.

724
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:19,065
It's an aluminum ring and has a
radius of about five

725
00:47:19,065 --> 00:47:21,971
centimeters.
Since I know all the

726
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:26,225
dimensions,
I can calculate the resistance

727
00:47:26,225 --> 00:47:28,939
of that ring.
You should be able to do that,

728
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:31,021
too, if I gave you the
dimensions.

729
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:34,87
And so the resistance of that
ring very roughly is about seven

730
00:47:34,87 --> 00:47:36,889
times ten to the minus five
ohms.

731
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:39,602
It's very small.
I can all-, this is at room

732
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:42,693
temperature, by the way,
the lower temperature the

733
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,533
resistance is lower.
I can also calculate very

734
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:48,561
roughly what the self-inductance
is of that ring.

735
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:51,905
Now that's not so easy,
because here when I calculated

736
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:55,25
the self-inductance,
the magnetic

737
00:47:55,25 --> 00:47:58,227
field was constant.
I assumed it was constant,

738
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:01,072
uniform inside.
That's not the case when you

739
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:03,454
have a ring.
You have a dipole field.

740
00:48:03,454 --> 00:48:07,358
However, I just assumed that
the magnetic field was the same

741
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,593
everywhere at the surface of the
ring -- and with that assumption

742
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:15,629
admittedly I could be off maybe
by twenty or thirty percent --

743
00:48:15,629 --> 00:48:19,665
with that assumption I find that
the self-inductance is ten to

744
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:22,775
the minus seven Henry.
I know what the omega is.

745
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:26,216
It's three hundred sixty,
roughly, and so I find that

746
00:48:26,216 --> 00:48:30,704
omega L over R
for this ring is about one

747
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:33,629
half, run at that frequency
omega.

748
00:48:33,629 --> 00:48:38,771
And that gives me a phase angle
phi of twenty five degrees,

749
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:44,178
and therefore the ring is going
to be repelled by the coil and

750
00:48:44,178 --> 00:48:48,965
of course the coil is going to
be repelled by the ring.

751
00:48:48,965 --> 00:48:53,485
I'll put the ring here,
and the ring is supported by

752
00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:56,588
this, so this ring cannot fall
over.

753
00:48:56,588 --> 00:49:00,666
The only difference between
this

754
00:49:00,666 --> 00:43:02,552
experiment and that one is
first of all I can be very

755
00:43:02,552 --> 00:37:38,872
quantitative there,
I can actually calculate the

756
00:37:38,872 --> 00:32:08,305
phase angle, where here that's
almost impossible.

757
00:32:08,305 --> 00:25:15,097
Here, it is the conductor that
I'm going to make levitate and

758
00:25:15,097 --> 00:19:23,87
the coil is stationary.
In here it was the conductor

759
00:19:23,87 --> 00:14:13,963
that was stationary,
and the coil is floating,

760
00:14:13,963 --> 00:09:24,718
but of course the idea is
exactly the same.

761
00:09:24,718 --> 00:03:40,377
And so what I want to do now is
make you see there,

762
00:03:40,377 --> 00:00:00
actually, hmmmm,

763
00:00:00 --> 00:49:33

764
00:49:33 --> 00:49:36,709
and we'll have to  ...
it should come up there .

765
00:49:36,709 --> 0.

766
0. --> 00:49:38,682
yes, there you see this,

767
00:49:38,682 --> 00:49:41,76
this ring.
Maybe I should first show you

768
00:49:41,76 --> 00:49:45,47
the whole set up.
So this ring goes over here --

769
00:49:45,47 --> 00:49:50,442
this is an aluminum ring -- and
I'm going to make it levitate by

770
00:49:50,442 --> 00:49:55,414
simply running sixty hertz under
ten volts through this coil and

771
00:49:55,414 --> 00:49:59,913
I hope I do nothing wrong.
Oh no, I have to turn on my AC.

772
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:04,333
Oh my God, that was not,
gee, that

773
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:07,638
was not my intention.
A good thing we don't have a

774
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:11,147
woman sitting on the ring now.
My idea was to have it

775
00:50:11,147 --> 00:50:13,846
levitate.
By the way, you did see that it

776
00:50:13,846 --> 00:50:16,14
was repelled,
that was quite clear.

777
00:50:16,14 --> 00:50:19,85
I had the current too high.
[laughter] I had the current

778
00:50:19,85 --> 00:50:22,549
too high so we'll have it a
little lower,

779
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:26,395
and I will make the current
come up very slowly and then I

780
00:50:26,395 --> 00:50:28,621
want you to see that it
levitates.

781
00:50:28,621 --> 00:50:30,173
There it is,
levitating.

782
00:50:30,173 --> 00:50:32,535
Oh, oh, off the screen.
There it is.

783
00:50:32,535 --> 00:50:35,773
And I can turn it over and it's
still levitating,

784
00:50:35,773 --> 00:47:32,675
of course.
And the secret is this phase

785
00:47:32,675 --> 00:43:14,544
delay introduced by the
self-inductance.

786
00:43:14,544 --> 00:36:37,42
I have another ring here which
has a, a slot -- also aluminum

787
00:36:37,42 --> 00:33:12,239
-- same ring,
but it has a slot.

788
00:33:12,239 --> 00:27:34,684
Well, the EMF in this ring is
going to be identical.

789
00:27:34,684 --> 00:21:43,891
There's no difference.
In fact, the self-inductance of

790
00:21:43,891 --> 00:15:46,479
this ring is identical,
but the resistance of this ring

791
00:15:46,479 --> 00:09:09,355
is huge because there's a slot
in there and the resistance is

792
00:09:09,355 --> 00:03:38,418
almost infinitely high.
And so if the resistance is

793
00:03:38,418 --> 00:00:00
infinitely high,

794
00:00:00 --> 00:51:11

795
00:51:11 --> 00:44:59,561
no matter what L is and what
omega is, phi is going to be

796
00:44:59,561 --> 00:42:46,904
zero.
It won't repel.

797
00:42:46,904 --> 00:37:15,263
Half the time it attracts,
half the time it repels.

798
00:37:15,263 --> 00:31:30,356
[metallic clanking sound] That
means nothing happens,

799
00:31:30,356 --> 00:25:32,183
no magnetic levitation.
Same EMF, same self-inductance,

800
00:25:32,183 --> 00:19:53,909
but an infinite resistance and
here you see magnetic

801
00:19:53,909 --> 00:15:35,228
levitation.
Since the induced current in

802
00:15:35,228 --> 00:09:50,321
the ring is extremely small
because of it's very high

803
00:09:50,321 --> 00:03:25,617
resistance, the force on the
ring -- whether it's repelling

804
00:03:25,617 --> 00:00:00
or attracting

805
00:00:00 --> 00:51:41

806
00:51:41 --> 01:46:53,431
-- in any case is practically
zero.

807
01:46:53,431 --> 03:27:33,748
So that alone is enough reason
for the ring not to move at all.

808
03:27:33,748 --> 05:09:51,489
All right, I hope to see all of
you tomorrow during our exciting

809
05:09:51,489 --> 309:56
testing of the motors.
