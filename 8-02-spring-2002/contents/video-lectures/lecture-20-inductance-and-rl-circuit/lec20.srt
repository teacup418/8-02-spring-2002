1
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
Today, I will quantify the
ability of a circuit to fight a

2
00:00:16 --> 00:00:21
magnetic flux that is produced
by the circuits themselves.

3
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
If you have a circuit and you
run a current through the

4
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
circuit, then you create some
magnetic fields,

5
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
and if the currents are
changing then the magnetic

6
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
fields are changing.
And so there will be an induced

7
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
EMF in that circuit that fights
the

8
00:00:37 --> 00:00:42
change, and we express that in
terms of a self-inductance:

9
00:00:42 --> 00:00:49
L, self-inductance,
and the word self speaks for

10
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
itself.
It's doing it to itself.

11
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
Magnetic flux that is produced
by a circuit is always

12
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
proportional to the current.
You double the current,

13
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
the magnetic flux doubles.
And so it is the

14
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
proportionality constant that we
call L, that is the

15
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
self-inductance,
and so therefore the induced

16
00:01:13 --> 00:01:20
EMF equals minus d phi/dt,
that is Faraday's Law.

17
00:01:23 --> 00:01:28
And so that becomes minus L dI/dt.

18
00:01:28 --> 00:01:35
L is only a matter of geometry.
L is not a function of the

19
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
current itself.
I will calculate for you a very

20
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
simple case of the
self-inductance

21
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
of a solenoid.

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:51
Let this be a solenoid and this
is a closed circuit,

23
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
and we run a current I through
the solenoid,

24
00:01:54 --> 00:01:59
and the radius of these
windings is little r.

25
00:01:59 --> 00:02:04
Let's say there're N windings
and the length of the solenoid

26
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
is little l.
Perhaps you'll remember that we

27
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
earlier derived,
using Ampere's Law,

28
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
that the magnetic field inside
the

29
00:02:13 --> 00:02:20
solenoid is mu 0 times I
times capital N divided by l.

30
00:02:20 --> 00:02:25
This is the number of windings
per meter.

31
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
If we attach an open surface to
this closed loop,

32
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
very difficult to imagine what
that open surface looks like --

33
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
we discussed it many times --
inside this solenoid you have

34
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
sort of a staircase-like of
surface.

35
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
That magnetic field penetrates
that surface N times because you

36
00:02:43 --> 00:02:48
have N loops.
And so the magnetic flux,

37
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
phi of B, is simply the area by
little r squared,

38
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
which is the surface area of
one loop, because I assume that

39
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
the magnetic field is constant
inside the solenoid,

40
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
and I assume that it is 0
outside, which is a very good

41
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
approximation.
So we get pi little r squared

42
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
surface area of one loop,
but we have N loops and then

43
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
we have to multiply that by that
constant magnetic field.

44
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
So we get an N squared because
we have an N here,

45
00:03:16 --> 00:03:23
mu 0 I divided by L.
And this we call L times I.

46
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
That's our definition for
self-inductance.

47
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
And so the self-inductance L is
purely geometry.

48
00:03:31 --> 00:03:37
It's pi little R squared,
capital N squared divided by L

49
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
times mu 0.

50

51
00:03:38 --> 00:03:45
Let me check this.
Pi little r squared,

52
00:03:48 --> 00:03:54
I have a capital N squared,
mu 0, that's correct,

53
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
divided by little l.
And so we can calculate,

54
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
for instance,
what this self-inductance is

55
00:04:01 --> 00:04:08
for a solenoid that we have used
in class several times.

56
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
We had one whereby we had
2800 windings.

57
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
R I think was something like
5 centimeters -- you have to

58
00:04:16 --> 00:04:21
work SI of course,
be careful -- and we had a

59
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
length,
was 0.6 meters.

60
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
We had it several times out
here, and if you substitute

61
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
those numbers in there,
you will find that the

62
00:04:31 --> 00:04:38
self-inductance of that solenoid
is 0.1 in SI units and we

63
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
call the SI units Henry,
capital H.

64
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
It would be the same as volt-seconds per ampere,

65
00:04:47 --> 00:04:54
but no one would ever use that.
We call that Henry.

66
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Every circuit has a finite
value for

67
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
the self-inductance,
however small that may be.

68
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
Sometimes it's so small that we
ignore it, but if you take a

69
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
simple loop, a
simple current,

70
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
just one wire that goes around
-- whether it is a rectangle

71
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
or whether it is a circle it
doesn't make any difference --

72
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
it always produces a magnetic
field.

73
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
It always produces a magnetic
flux through the surface,

74
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
and so it always has a finite
self-inductance.

75
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
Maybe only 9- nano Henrys,
maybe only micro Henrys,

76
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
but it's never 0.

77

78
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
And so now what I want to do is
to show you the remarkable

79
00:05:33 --> 00:05:40
consequences of the presence of
a self-inductor in a circuit,

80
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
and I start very simple.
I have here a battery which has

81
00:05:46 --> 00:05:51
EMF V.
I have here a switch,

82
00:05:51 --> 00:05:56
and here are the self-inductor.
We always draw a self-inductor

83
00:05:56 --> 00:06:03
in a circuit with these coils,
and we also have in series a

84
00:06:03 --> 00:06:08
resistor, which we always
indicate with this,

85
00:06:08 --> 00:06:14
these teeth.
And I close this switch when

86
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
there is no current running.
In other words,

87
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
at time T equals 0 when I
close the switch,

88
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
there is no current.
When I close this switch the

89
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
current wants to increase,
but the self-inductance says

90
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
uh-huh, uh-huh,
take it easy,

91
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
Lenz law, I don't like the
change of such a current.

92
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
So the self-inductance is
fighting the current that wants

93
00:06:39 --> 00:06:44
to go through it.
There comes a time that the

94
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
self-inductance loses the fight,
if you wait long enough,

95
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
and then of course the current
has reached a maximum volume,

96
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
which you can find with Ohm's
Law, because the self-inductance

97
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
itself

98
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
has no resistor.
Think of the self-inductance as

99
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
made of super-conducting
material.

100
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
There's no resistance.
And so without knowing much

101
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
about physics,
you can make a plot about the

102
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
current that is going to flow as
a function of time.

103
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
You start out with 0 and
then ultimately,

104
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
if you wait long enough,
you reach a maximum current

105
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
which is
given by Ohm's Law,

106
00:07:25 --> 00:07:32
which is simply V divided by R.
And you slowly approach that

107
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
value.
And how slowly depends on the

108
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
value of the self-inductance.
If the self-inductance is very

109
00:07:39 --> 00:07:44
high, it might climb up like
this, so this is a high value

110
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
for L.
If the self-inductance is very

111
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
low, that is a low value
for L.

112
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
If the self-inductance were
0, it would come up

113
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
instantaneously,
but I just convinced you that

114
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
there I no such thing as 0
self-inductance.

115
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
There's always something
finite, no matter how small.

116
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
And so this is qualitatively
what you would expect if you use

117
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
your stomach and if you don't
use your brains yet.

118
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
There's nothing wrong with
using your stomach occasionally,

119
00:08:14 --> 00:08:19
but now I want to do this in a
move civilized way,

120
00:08:19 --> 00:08:25
and I want to use my brains,
and when I use my brains I have

121
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
to set up an equation for this
circuit.

122
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
And if you read your book,

123
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
you will find that Mr. Giancoli tells you
to use

124
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
Kirshhoff's Loop Rule.
But Mr. Giancoli doesn't

125
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
understand Faraday's Law,
and he's not the only one.

126
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
Almost every college book that
you read on physics do this

127
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
wrong.
They advise you to use

128
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
Kirshhoff's Loop Rule,
which says that the closed loop

129
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
integral around the circuit is
0.

130
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
That, of course,
is utter nonsense.

131
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
How can it be 0?
Because there is a change in

132
00:08:57 --> 00:09:02
magnetic flux,
and so it can only be minus d phi/dt.

133
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
I advise you to go to the 8.02

134
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
website and download a
lecture supplement that you will

135
00:09:09 --> 00:09:15
find in which I address this
issue and hit it very hard.

136
00:09:15 --> 00:09:21
So the closed loop integral of
E dot dL, if you go around the

137
00:09:21 --> 00:09:28
circuit, is not 0,
is minus d phi/dt -- Faraday's

138
00:09:29 --> 00:09:36
Law -- so it's minus L dI/dt.
So we have to go around to

139
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
circuit
and we have to apply Faraday's

140
00:09:41 --> 00:09:48
law and not Kirshhoff's Loop
Rule, which doesn't apply here.

141
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
This is the plus side of the
battery and this is the minus

142
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
side, so the electric field in
the battery is in this

143
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
direction.
The electric field in the

144
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
self-inductance is 0 because
the self-inductance has no

145
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
resistance, it's super-conducting material,

146
00:10:03 --> 00:10:08
and so the electric field in
the resistor -- if the current

147
00:10:08 --> 00:10:13
is in this direction,
which it will be -- then the

148
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
electric field in the resistor
will be in this direction.

149
00:10:17 --> 00:10:22
So now I am equipped to write
down the closed loop integral of

150
00:10:22 --> 00:10:29
E dot dL.
I start here and I always go in

151
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
the direction of the current,
and I advise you to do the

152
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
same.
I don't care that you guess the

153
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
wrong direction for the current.
That's fine.

154
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
Later, minus signs will correct
that,

155
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
they will tell you that you
really guessed the wrong

156
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
direction, but always go around
the loop in the direction of the

157
00:10:48 --> 00:10:53
current, because then the EMF is
always minus L dI/dt.

158
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
If you go in the direction
opposed to the current,

159
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
then it is plus L dI/dt and that
could become confusing.

160
00:10:59 --> 00:11:03
So I always go in the direction
of the current,

161
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
and so I first go through the
self-inductance.

162
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
There is no electric field in
the self-inductance,

163
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
so the integral E dot dL -- in
going from here to here -- is

164
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
0.
This is where the books are

165
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
wrong.
It is 0.

166
00:11:18 --> 00:11:23
Now, I go through the resistor,
and so now I get plus IR, E and

167
00:11:23 --> 00:11:28
dL are in the same direction.
Ohm's Law tells me it's IR.

168
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
In the battery,
I go against the electric

169
00:11:31 --> 00:11:38
field, and so I get minus V.
That now equals minus L

170
00:11:39 --> 00:11:45
dI/dt, and this is the only
thing and the only correct way

171
00:11:45 --> 00:11:51
to apply
Faraday's Law in this circuit.

172
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
You can write it a little
differently, which may give you

173
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
some insight.
For instance,

174
00:11:57 --> 00:12:04
you could write that I can
bring V and the L,

175
00:12:04 --> 00:12:11
and L, to one side -- so I can
write down that V minus L dI/dt

176
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
equals IR.
It's the same equation when you

177
00:12:15 --> 00:12:21
look, and the nice thing about
writing it this way is that

178
00:12:21 --> 00:12:27
since dI/dt is positive here
-- it's growing in time -- the

179
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
induced EMF, which is this value
-- notice it's always opposing

180
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
the voltage of my battery -- and
that's what Lenz's Law is all

181
00:12:35 --> 00:12:39
about.
It's not until dI/dt has

182
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
become 0 that V equals IR,
and that happens,

183
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
of course, if you wait long
enough.

184
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
And so we have to solve that
differential equation,

185
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
and what is often done that you
bring all the terms to the left

186
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
side and that you get an, a
0 on the right side.

187
00:12:55 --> 00:13:02
And so what you often see is
that L dI/dt plus IR minus V

188
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
equals 0.
And because we have a 0

189
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
here, some physicist thinks that
this is an application of

190
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
Kirchhoff's Rule.
This is nonsense.

191
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
You can always make it 0
here by bringing all the terms

192
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
to this side.
The closed loop integral of E

193
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
dot dL is not 0,
the closed loop integral of E

194
00:13:24 --> 00:13:29
dot dL is minus L dI/dt,
but when I shift minus L dI/dt to

195
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
this side I get 0 here.
And of course the people who

196
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
write these books know that this
is the right answer and so they

197
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
manipulate it so they get this
equation and they call that

198
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
Kirchhoff's Rule.
Sad, and also embarrassing.

199
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
So, this is the equation that
you have to solve.

200
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
Some of you may have solved
this equation in 8.01

201
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
already.
Surely you didn't have an I

202
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
here.
You may have had an X here for

203
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
the position,
but you probably solved it when

204
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
you had friction.
Maybe you didn't.

205
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
I will give you the solution to
that differential equation.

206
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
It's a very easy solution.
The current as a function of

207
00:14:04 --> 00:14:10
time is a maximum value times
1-e to the minus R

208
00:14:10 --> 00:14:17
divided by L times T,
and I max -- that is the maximum

209
00:14:17 --> 00:14:22
current -- is V divided by R.
And let's look at this in a

210
00:14:22 --> 00:14:27
little bit more detail.
First, notice that when t

211
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
equals 0 that indeed you find
I equals 0.

212
00:14:33 --> 00:14:38
Substitute in here t equals
0, you get 1-1.

213
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
So you find,
indeed, that I equals 0.

214
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
Substituting there t goes to
infinity, then you find that I

215
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
indeed becomes V divided by R,
which is exactly what you

216
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
expect.
If t becomes infinity,

217
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
then clearly the
self-inductance has lost all

218
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
its power, so to speak,
and the current is simply V

219
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
divided by R,
the maximum current that you

220
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
can have.
And so that's a must,

221
00:15:02 --> 00:15:09
that's a requirement.
If you wait L over R seconds --

222
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
and believe it or not,
if you have some time,

223
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
convince yourself that L over R
indeed, as a unit,

224
00:15:15 --> 00:15:22
is seconds -- then the current
I is about 63%

225
00:15:23 --> 00:15:30
of I max, because if t is L over
R, then you get 1-1

226
00:15:31 --> 00:15:36
divided by E,
and that is about 0.63.

227
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
And if you wait double this

228
00:15:38 --> 00:15:43
time, then you have about 86% of the maximum

229
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
current.
In other words,

230
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
right here -- if I wait L over
R

231
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
seconds -- this value here is
about 0.63 times

232
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
the maximum value possible,
and it's very,

233
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
it's climbing up and
asymptotically approaches then,

234
00:16:02 --> 00:16:09
ultimately, the maximum current
which is V divided by R.

235
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
Make sure you download that
lecture supplement that you'll

236
00:16:13 --> 00:16:20
find on the Web.
Now, what I'm going to do is

237
00:16:21 --> 00:16:27
all of a sudden I'm going to
make this voltage 0.

238
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
The way I could do that is by
simply shorting it out.

239
00:16:29 --> 00:16:36
Of course on the blackboard,
I can simply remove it.

240
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
So it's not there.
The current is still running

241
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
and all of a sudden at a new
time -- t 0,

242
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
I define the time t 0 again
-- the voltage is 0.

243
00:16:48 --> 00:16:49
And now comes the question what
is

244
00:16:49 --> 00:16:55
now going to happen?
Well, the self-inductance

245
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
doesn't like the fact that the
current is going down,

246
00:16:58 --> 00:17:03
so it's going to fight that
change, and so you expect that

247
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
the current is not going to die
off right away,

248
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
but you expect that the current
is going to go down sort of like

249
00:17:09 --> 00:17:14
so.
And you want,

250
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
when you wait long enough,
you want that,

251
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
at t goes to infinity,

252
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
where t equals 0 the current
is still maximum,

253
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
so it's still V over R,
but when you go to infinity --

254
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
if you wait long enough -- then,
of course, the current has to

255
00:17:34 --> 00:17:39
become 0.
And as the current dies out,

256
00:17:39 --> 00:17:43
heat is being produced in that
resistor at a rate of I square R

257
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
joules per second,
and then there comes a time

258
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
that the current becomes almost
0 and then the whole show is

259
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
over.
And so we can also calculate

260
00:17:54 --> 00:17:58
the exact time behavior by going
back to our differential

261
00:17:58 --> 00:18:03
equation and make V 0.
Where is that differential

262
00:18:03 --> 00:18:04
equation?

263
00:18:03 --> 00:18:10
Is it hiding?
Oh, there it is.

264
00:18:11 --> 00:18:17
So I solved this differential
equation, but this is now 0.

265
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
And the solution to that
differential equation is that I

266
00:18:21 --> 00:18:26
as a function of time is I max
times e to

267
00:18:26 --> 00:18:33
the minus R over L times t,
and that exactly has all the

268
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
quantities that you want it to
have, because notice that at t

269
00:18:37 --> 00:18:41
equals 0 -- when you put in t
equals 0 -- the current is

270
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
indeed maximum,
and that's what you require.

271
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
That's the moment that you make
that capital V 0,

272
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
the current was still running.
But notice that when t goes to

273
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
infinity --
if you wait long enough -- that

274
00:18:55 --> 00:19:01
indeed the current goes to 0.
And if you wait L over R

275
00:19:01 --> 00:19:05
seconds, then you are down to
about 37% of

276
00:19:05 --> 00:19:09
your maximum current.
So if you now go to I,

277
00:19:09 --> 00:19:16
I re-define t equals 0 here,
so if now I wait L over R

278
00:19:17 --> 00:19:21
seconds then this value here is
about 37% of

279
00:19:21 --> 00:19:26
that value.
So you've lost 63%.

280
00:19:26 --> 00:19:27
And so you see,

281
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
this is the consequence of the
fact that the circuit is capable

282
00:19:31 --> 00:19:38
of fighting its own magnetic
flux that it is creating.

283
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
When the current was running
happily here,

284
00:19:40 --> 00:19:44
with the battery in place,
the current was,

285
00:19:44 --> 00:19:48
let's say, all the time I max --
at least very close to that

286
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
value -- V over R.
And so all the time,

287
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
there was heat produced in the
resistor.

288
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
I square R joules per second.
Who was providing that,

289
00:19:56 --> 00:19:57
uh, energy?
Well, of course,

290
00:19:57 --> 00:20:00
the
battery.

291
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
But now, when I take the
battery out, there is still

292
00:20:04 --> 00:20:07
current running,
and that means while the

293
00:20:07 --> 00:20:11
current is dying there is still
heat produced in that resistor,

294
00:20:11 --> 00:20:15
and that heat slowly comes out
until the current ultimately

295
00:20:15 --> 00:20:17
becomes 0.
Now where does that energy come

296
00:20:17 --> 00:20:20
from?
Well that energy must come from

297
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
the magnetic field that is
present in the solenoid,

298
00:20:24 --> 00:20:30
and this idea -- that we have
energy that comes out in the

299
00:20:30 --> 00:20:32
form of heat,
which really was there ear-,

300
00:20:32 --> 00:20:35
earlier in the form of a
magnetic field -- allows us to

301
00:20:35 --> 00:20:42
evaluate what we call the
magnetic energy field density.

302
00:20:43 --> 00:20:49
Let me first calculate how much
heat is produced as the current

303
00:20:49 --> 00:20:51
goes from a maximum value down
to 0.

304
00:20:51 --> 00:20:57
Hmmmm, I'll have to erase
something.

305
00:20:57 --> 00:21:04
I'll erase this part here.
So at any moment in time,

306
00:21:04 --> 00:21:11
the current is producing heat
in the resistor,

307
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
and so if I,
if my voltage becomes 0 at

308
00:21:16 --> 00:21:21
time t equals 0,
then this is the amount of

309
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
heat, uh-uh, no square here.
I square R dt,

310
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
integrated from 0 to
infinity, is the total heat that

311
00:21:30 --> 00:21:33
is produced
as the current dies out,

312
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
but I know what this current
was -- I just erased it,

313
00:21:36 --> 00:21:42
if I still remember it -- so I
can bring I max outside and I can

314
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
bring the resistance outside and
then I get the integral from 0

315
00:21:46 --> 00:21:53
to infinity of e to the minus R
over L times t dt.

316
00:21:54 --> 00:21:59
And this is a trivial integral.
This integral is,

317
00:21:59 --> 00:22:04
uhm, L divided by 2 R.
Oh, by the way,

318
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
it is I squared,
so I have a 2 here.

319
00:22:06 --> 00:22:10
It's very important.
Don't forget the 2.

320
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
And so that integral is L
divided by 2R,

321
00:22:13 --> 00:22:19
and so if now I look at the
product of I square maximum R L

322
00:22:19 --> 00:22:24
divided by 2 R,
I get one half L times I

323
00:22:24 --> 00:22:28
maximum squared.
So this comes out in the form

324
00:22:28 --> 00:22:34
of heat, and I max is then the
maximum current that we had when

325
00:22:34 --> 00:22:41
the current
was flowing after a long time.

326
00:22:41 --> 00:22:44
I can now by,
by manipulating numbers,

327
00:22:44 --> 00:22:51
I can now calculate how much
energy there was in that field

328
00:22:51 --> 00:22:53
per cubic meter,
because the magnetic field was

329
00:22:53 --> 00:22:57
exclusively inside that
solenoid.

330
00:22:57 --> 00:23:00
And if I know that the energy
that is ultimately coming out is

331
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
one half LI squared,
then I have here I,

332
00:23:06 --> 00:23:11
and so I can replace that I
there by B divided by mu 0

333
00:23:11 --> 00:23:16
times L divided by N and here I
have L.

334
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20
And so if I substitute in here
the value for L that we have on

335
00:23:20 --> 00:23:23
the blackboard there,
and we substitute for I the

336
00:23:23 --> 00:23:27
value that we have there -- you
can drop the maximum now -- this

337
00:23:27 --> 00:23:29
simply tells you,
then, that any moment in time

338
00:23:29 --> 00:23:32
that I have a current I running
through a solenoid,

339
00:23:32 --> 00:23:35
that the energy that is
available in the solenoid in the

340
00:23:35 --> 00:23:39
forms of magnetic energy is one
half LI squared.

341
00:23:39 --> 00:23:42
And so when you do that,
you substitute capital L and

342
00:23:42 --> 00:23:49
capital I, you will find that
one half LI squared then becomes

343
00:23:52 --> 00:23:59
B squared over 2 mu 0
times pi little r squared times

344
00:24:00 --> 00:24:03
l.
You check that at home.

345
00:24:03 --> 00:24:08
It's simply a substitution.
But this is the volume of the

346
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
solenoid where the magnetic
field exists,

347
00:24:12 --> 00:24:14
and we have assumed that the
magnetic field is 0

348
00:24:14 --> 00:24:18
everywhere outside.
And if you accept that,

349
00:24:18 --> 00:24:25
then you see that we now have a
result for the magnetic field

350
00:24:28 --> 00:24:33
energy density -- that is how
much energy there is per cubic

351
00:24:33 --> 00:24:35
meter -- that is,
of course, this value.

352
00:24:35 --> 00:24:39
Because this is the total
energy of the magnetic field,

353
00:24:39 --> 00:24:42
if we know the current,
and this is the volume of the

354
00:24:42 --> 00:24:44
magnetic field.
So the magne-,

355
00:24:44 --> 00:24:48
magnetic field energy density
is then B squared divided by 2

356
00:24:48 --> 00:24:53
mu 0, and this is in joules
per cubic meter.

357
00:24:53 --> 00:24:56
So in principle,
if you knew the magnetic field

358
00:24:56 --> 00:24:59
everywhere in space,
then you can integrate over all

359
00:24:59 --> 00:25:03
space and you can then calculate
how much energy is,

360
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
uhm, present in the magnetic
field.

361
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
And earlier in this course,
we did something similar for

362
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
electric fields.
We calculated the electric

363
00:25:12 --> 00:25:16
field energy density.
Perhaps you remember whatit

364
00:25:16 --> 00:25:18
was.
It was one half epsilon 0

365
00:25:18 --> 00:25:23
kappa times E squared.
It was also in joules per cubic

366
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
meter.
Now in the case of an electric

367
00:25:27 --> 00:25:32
field, this represents the work
that I had to do to arrange the

368
00:25:32 --> 00:25:34
charges in a certain
configuration.

369
00:25:34 --> 00:25:39
In the case of a magnetic
field, it represents the work

370
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
that I have to do to get a
current going inside

371
00:25:43 --> 00:25:46
a pure self-inductor.
That means the resistance of

372
00:25:46 --> 00:25:51
the self-inductor is 0,
and it takes work because the

373
00:25:51 --> 00:25:54
solenoid will oppose the
building up of the current,

374
00:25:54 --> 00:25:59
and so I have to do work.
So there's a parallel between

375
00:25:59 --> 00:26:06
the two.
I can make you see,

376
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
in a quite dramatic way,
how strong self-inductances can

377
00:26:10 --> 00:26:15
fight their own current,
and the way I'm going to do

378
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18
that is
with the setup there,

379
00:26:18 --> 00:26:24
whereby I have a twelve volt
car battery and I have two light

380
00:26:24 --> 00:26:30
bulbs.
I have here an enormous

381
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33
self-inductance L,
30 Henry.

382
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36
We will learn later in the
course how you make such a high

383
00:26:36 --> 00:26:41
self-inductance,
and then here is a light bulb.

384
00:26:41 --> 00:26:43
The light bulb has a resistance
of 6 ohm.

385
00:26:43 --> 00:26:47
This self-inductance,

386
00:26:47 --> 00:26:49
there is nothing we can do
about it.

387
00:26:49 --> 00:26:51
It happens to have 4 ohm
resistance.

388
00:26:51 --> 00:26:53
We don't have a self,
we don't have s-,

389
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57
superconducting wires here,
so it also has a resistance of

390
00:26:57 --> 00:26:59
4 ohms.
Forgive me for that but there

391
00:26:59 --> 00:27:06
is nothing I can do about it.
I have here another resistance

392
00:27:07 --> 00:27:13
of 4 ohms and a light bulb,
which is the same one as that

393
00:27:13 --> 00:27:18
one -- also 6 ohms -- and then
here is my car battery plus a

394
00:27:18 --> 00:27:22
switch.
And the car battery is twelve

395
00:27:22 --> 00:27:29
volts, and I'm going to throw
the switch, turn it on.

396
00:27:29 --> 00:27:32
You will see that this light
bulb comes on almost

397
00:27:32 --> 00:27:35
instantaneously.
There is no self-inductance in

398
00:27:35 --> 00:27:38
this loop -- well,
maybe a few microhenry or even

399
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
less -- but in this loop here
there is this huge

400
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
self-inductance,
and so the self-inductance says

401
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
take it easy to the current,
take it easy,

402
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
just wait, and you will very
slowly see that

403
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
light bulb come on.
And we can calculate how long

404
00:27:54 --> 00:27:59
it takes, because we have here
10 ohms -- 6 ohms and 4

405
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
ohms, so L divided by R,
we have 30 divided by 10

406
00:28:05 --> 00:28:11
-- so that is 3 seconds.
So what that means is that even

407
00:28:11 --> 00:28:14
after 6 seconds,
which is twice this time,

408
00:28:14 --> 00:28:19
even then the current through
this light bulb is only

409
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
86% of its maximum.
But that means since the light,

410
00:28:23 --> 00:28:28
of course, is proportional to I
square R in the light bulb,

411
00:28:28 --> 00:28:31
that the light is only 75% of maximum,

412
00:28:31 --> 00:28:34
and even if you wait 9
seconds, then the light that

413
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
comes out here is still only
90% of it's maximum,

414
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
whereas this one comes on
immediately.

415
00:28:40 --> 00:28:45
The reason why we put the 4
ohm here, we want this part to

416
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
be -- from an ohmic resistance
point of view -- to be identical

417
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
as this part.
So that's why you artificially

418
00:28:50 --> 00:28:53
added here the 4 ohm,
because the 4 ohm is always

419
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
there in the self-inductance,
there is nothing we can do

420
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
about it.
And so you are going to see a

421
00:28:57 --> 00:29:01
remarkable example.
This is one light bulb.

422
00:29:01 --> 00:29:08
That is the one that is here,
and this is the light bulb that

423
00:29:08 --> 00:29:11
is there, and the
self-inductance is in this

424
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
incredible monster,
here.

425
00:29:13 --> 00:29:18
I'll make the lights,
change the light setting a

426
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
little bit so that we can see
the lights of the bulb.

427
00:29:20 --> 00:29:23
The bulbs are only 8-watt
bulbs, they're not very,

428
00:29:23 --> 00:29:24
very strong,
not

429
00:29:24 --> 00:29:30
very bright bulbs,
but the effect will be very

430
00:29:30 --> 00:29:31
clear.
So if you're ready for this --

431
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
so this is the one that I think
comes on immediately,

432
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
and this is the one that takes
its time -- three,

433
00:29:38 --> 00:29:43
two, one, zero.
One, two, three,

434
00:29:43 --> 00:29:45
four, five, six,
you see how slow?

435
00:29:45 --> 00:29:49
It's still not very bright,
it's still getting brighter.

436
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
It's still not as bright as
this one.

437
00:29:53 --> 00:29:56
It's getting there,
you can actually do some timing

438
00:29:56 --> 00:30:01
by
counting.

439
00:30:01 --> 00:30:03
By the way, the values of the
resistance that I gave you are

440
00:30:03 --> 00:30:06
when the light bulbs are hot.
Three, two, one,

441
00:30:06 --> 00:30:09
zero, one, two,
three, four,

442
00:30:09 --> 00:30:13
five, six, seven,
eight, nine,

443
00:30:13 --> 00:30:15
ten, eleven,
twelve, I'm still seeing it

444
00:30:15 --> 00:30:20
getting brighter.
What you're seeing here is a

445
00:30:20 --> 00:30:25
remarkable example that the
self-inductance is fighting

446
00:30:25 --> 00:30:27
itself.
That's why the name

447
00:30:27 --> 00:30:32
self-inductance
is so nice.

448
00:30:32 --> 00:30:39
Now I want to go one step
further and I want to power the

449
00:30:42 --> 00:30:49
LR circuit with a AC power
supply.

450
00:30:49 --> 00:30:53
If you have an AC power supply
-- so it's changing all the

451
00:30:53 --> 00:30:57
time, the voltage -- now,
of course, the self-inductance

452
00:30:57 --> 00:30:59
is
fighting back all the time,

453
00:30:59 --> 00:31:03
not just only in the beginning
as you saw in this circuit,

454
00:31:03 --> 00:31:09
but now, of course,
it is active almost all the

455
00:31:09 --> 00:31:13
time.
So we can do away with this,

456
00:31:13 --> 00:31:19
and so now we replace the
battery by a AC power supply,

457
00:31:19 --> 00:31:23
which we normally put just a
wiggle there,

458
00:31:23 --> 00:31:30
and here is the self-inductance
L, and here is the resistor R.

459
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
And let the voltage provided by
this power supply be V 0

460
00:31:39 --> 00:31:44
times the cosine of omega T,
omega being the angular

461
00:31:44 --> 00:31:50
frequency.
And now, I have to apply

462
00:31:50 --> 00:31:54
Faraday's Law,
not Kirchhoff's Rule --

463
00:31:54 --> 00:31:58
Faraday's Law -- when I go
around this circuit and I set up

464
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
the differential equation.
And of course the differential

465
00:32:02 --> 00:32:05
equation is going to be exactly
like this, except that V,

466
00:32:05 --> 00:32:10
now, is V 0 times the cosine
of omega T.

467
00:32:10 --> 00:32:13
And now I have to solve for
this differential equation.

468
00:32:13 --> 00:32:16
That's the only difference,
so I don't have to start from

469
00:32:16 --> 00:32:20
ground zero.
And the solution to this

470
00:32:20 --> 00:32:25
differential equation is quite
remarkable and not so intuitive.

471
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
The current -- as a function of
time, now -- is V 0 divided

472
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
by the square root of R squared
plus omega

473
00:32:36 --> 00:32:43
L squared times the cosine of
omega t minus phi,

474
00:32:44 --> 00:32:48
and the tangent of phi,
that angle phi,

475
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
is omega L divided by R.
And of course we need some time

476
00:32:54 --> 00:32:59
to digest this.
The first thing that you notice

477
00:32:59 --> 00:33:03
is that there is a phase lag
between the current and the

478
00:33:03 --> 00:33:09
driving voltage.
If phi, as you're going to see,

479
00:33:09 --> 00:33:13
is, uhm, 90 degrees,
then the current is delayed by

480
00:33:13 --> 00:33:16
one quarter of a cycle,
though the fact that the

481
00:33:16 --> 00:33:19
current comes later than the
driving voltage perhaps is

482
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
intuitive, because the
self-inductance is fighting the

483
00:33:23 --> 00:33:25
change in the current.
So it's perhaps not so

484
00:33:25 --> 00:33:29
surprising that there's going to
be a delay, that the current

485
00:33:29 --> 00:33:36
comes a little later.
If you look at this equation

486
00:33:36 --> 00:33:40
here, then what you have in
front of the cosine term is

487
00:33:40 --> 00:33:42
obviously the maximum
possible current,

488
00:33:42 --> 00:33:46
because the cosine term is just
oscillating between plus 1 and

489
00:33:46 --> 00:33:51
minus 1, and so this here is
the maximum current that you can

490
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
ever get.
In one full cycle you get

491
00:33:54 --> 00:33:57
positive and you get negative
net value.

492
00:33:57 --> 00:34:01
And notice here the role of
omega L really plays the role of

493
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
a resistance,
and in fact the dimension of

494
00:34:03 --> 00:34:08
omega L is ome-,
is, is, is ohms.

495
00:34:08 --> 00:34:09
It really plays the role of a

496
00:34:09 --> 00:34:14
resistance, and if omega is
very high then the resistance

497
00:34:14 --> 00:34:18
here becomes very high and so
your current becomes very low.

498
00:34:18 --> 00:34:21
Well, that's intuitively
pleasing because if omega is

499
00:34:21 --> 00:34:24
high, then the changes -- the
dI/dt's -- are very,

500
00:34:24 --> 00:34:29
very high, and therefore if
there are very fast changes the

501
00:34:29 --> 00:34:34
induced EMF is going to be high,
and so the current will be low.

502
00:34:34 --> 00:34:37
Also, if L is very high,
then the system also is capable

503
00:34:37 --> 00:34:41
of fighting back very hard,
and so it puts up a large

504
00:34:41 --> 00:34:44
resistance.
So it's also pleasing that you

505
00:34:44 --> 00:34:47
see the L there,
downstairs.

506
00:34:47 --> 00:34:51
If omega is very low,
in your mind you can make omega

507
00:34:51 --> 00:34:53
0.
You don't even have alternating

508
00:34:53 --> 00:34:57
current when omega is 0,
then you have DC which is

509
00:34:57 --> 00:34:59
direct current.
So when you make omega 0,

510
00:34:59 --> 00:35:02
you simply get I is V 0
divided by R.

511
00:35:02 --> 00:35:04
That's Ohm's Law,
that's obvious that you get

512
00:35:04 --> 00:35:09
that.
Let's now look at the phase

513
00:35:09 --> 00:35:11
angle.
The tangent of phi is omega L

514
00:35:11 --> 00:35:15
divided by R.
If the self-inductor is very

515
00:35:15 --> 00:35:17
large,

516
00:35:17 --> 00:35:21
then the system has a strong
ability to fight back,

517
00:35:21 --> 00:35:24
so it can delay that current by
a large amount,

518
00:35:24 --> 00:35:26
and the same is true is omega
is high.

519
00:35:26 --> 00:35:29
If omega is high then the time
changes are very,

520
00:35:29 --> 00:35:32
changes occur on a very small
time scale, and so the system

521
00:35:32 --> 00:35:35
can fight back.
Because remember,

522
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
you always have the EMF
proportion to dI/dt.

523
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
And so it's also pleasing to
see that omega and L are

524
00:35:41 --> 00:35:44
upstairs here.
Either one of being large it

525
00:35:44 --> 00:35:47
can
fight back and it can hold back

526
00:35:47 --> 00:35:54
the, the current.

527
00:35:54 --> 00:36:01
I have worked out a situation
whereby we have an LR circuit --

528
00:36:01 --> 00:36:05
this is on the Web,
you can download that so you

529
00:36:05 --> 00:36:09
don't have to copy it -- and the
reason why I have these values

530
00:36:09 --> 00:36:13
is because it is directly coupled to a demonstration
that I will do

531
00:36:13 --> 00:36:18
shortly.
You see, an L in series with an

532
00:36:18 --> 00:36:21
R, the L is 10 millihenry
and the R

533
00:36:21 --> 00:36:26
is 10 ohms,
and let V 0 be 10 volts.

534
00:36:26 --> 00:36:28
And here you see three
frequencies, 100 hertz,

535
00:36:28 --> 00:36:30
1000, and 1
hertz, and here you see the

536
00:36:30 --> 00:36:33
values for omega.
You have to multiply hertz with

537
00:36:33 --> 00:36:37
2 pi.
And look now at omega L.

538
00:36:37 --> 00:36:42
At low frequency -- a hundred
hertz -- omega L is 6.3

539
00:36:42 --> 00:36:45
ohms.
Compare that with the 10 ohms.

540
00:36:45 --> 00:36:47
They'd be comparable,
but now look for instance at

541
00:36:47 --> 00:36:51
10000 hertz.
The omega L is huge.

542
00:36:51 --> 00:36:52
It's

543
00:36:52 --> 00:36:56
ohms.
So it entirely determines -- so

544
00:36:56 --> 00:36:59
to speak -- the resistance of
that circuit.

545
00:36:59 --> 00:37:01
And so the current that is
going to run -- at least this is

546
00:37:01 --> 00:37:05
the maximum current is this
value, which we also saw here on

547
00:37:05 --> 00:37:09
the blackboard -- that current
at high frequently is enormously

548
00:37:09 --> 00:37:12
reduced.
It's 50 times lower than

549
00:37:12 --> 00:37:15
this current at low frequency,
even though they have the same

550
00:37:15 --> 00:37:19
value for V 0.
And then you see here the phase

551
00:37:19 --> 00:37:22
angles.
And the reason why you have

552
00:37:22 --> 00:37:24
these
values is that I can make you

553
00:37:24 --> 00:37:28
listen to this,
I can make you hear this,

554
00:37:28 --> 00:37:33
because your hearing is very
good at 100 hertz,

555
00:37:33 --> 00:37:36
and since all of you are young
you can probably hear even 1

556
00:37:36 --> 00:37:38
hertz,
maybe some of you can even hear

557
00:37:38 --> 00:37:41
20 kilohertz.
When you get older you lose

558
00:37:41 --> 00:37:43
your high frequencies.
In fact, my frequency cut off

559
00:37:43 --> 00:37:46
is somewhere near 
hertz.

560
00:37:46 --> 00:37:50
I'm going to make you listen to
music, and there will be violins

561
00:37:50 --> 00:37:55
which produce probably 3, 4, 5000 hertz,

562
00:37:55 --> 00:37:55
and then
I will turn on,

563
00:37:55 --> 00:37:58
all of a sudden,
the 10 millihenry.

564
00:37:58 --> 00:38:01
So first I will make you listen
to music whereby there is no 10

565
00:38:01 --> 00:38:05
millihenry in there,
and then I will turn on the 10

566
00:38:05 --> 00:38:06
millihenry,
and what you will hear,

567
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
that the violins disappear
because the current reduction is

568
00:38:10 --> 00:38:13
now huge on the high frequency
but is very little on the low

569
00:38:13 --> 00:38:17
frequency, and that's the idea
of what a self-inductor can do

570
00:38:17 --> 00:38:20
for you.
So if you listen to this

571
00:38:20 --> 00:38:27
[playback
of classical music with violin]

572
00:38:29 --> 00:38:36
there's no self-inductor in now.
There's no music either.

573
00:38:43 --> 00:38:50
[laughter] OK.
[Playback of classical music

574
00:38:57 --> 00:39:04
continues, without violin
notes.] OK.

575
00:39:04 --> 00:39:05
It's different music.
No self-inductor.

576
00:39:05 --> 00:39:06
[Click] Self-inductor.
The high frequencies are gone.

577
00:39:06 --> 00:39:08
[Playback of classical music
continues, again with violin

578
00:39:08 --> 00:39:10
notes] No self-inductor.
[Click] You can turn a violin

579
00:39:10 --> 00:39:12
concerto into a cello concerto.
[laughter].

580
00:39:12 --> 00:39:19
You just cut the violins out.
OK.

581
00:39:20 --> 00:39:27
I cannot make you listen to the
phase shift, not even in the

582
00:39:27 --> 00:39:28
case of the 90 degree phase
shift,

583
00:39:28 --> 00:39:31
and that is quite obvious
because what does it mean that

584
00:39:31 --> 00:39:33
there is a 90 degree phase
shift?

585
00:39:33 --> 00:39:38
It means that during one cycle
of 10000 hertz -- which

586
00:39:38 --> 00:39:41
takes only 1/10000 of
a second -- that the high

587
00:39:41 --> 00:39:45
frequencies are shifted by only
25 microseconds,

588
00:39:45 --> 00:39:48
and there's no way that your
ears, your ears can hear that.

589
00:39:48 --> 00:39:50
The fact that the composer
wanted those violins to come in

590
00:39:50 --> 00:39:55
25 microseconds earlier
than, than they do of course is

591
00:39:55 --> 00:39:58
something you cannot hear.
So I cannot make you listen to

592
00:39:58 --> 00:40:01
the phase shift,
but for the phase shift I have

593
00:40:01 --> 00:40:04
something else.
And for that something else,

594
00:40:04 --> 00:40:09
I'm going to return to the,
to my last lecture,

595
00:40:09 --> 00:40:15
in which we levitated a woman
-- magnetic levitation.

596
00:40:15 --> 00:40:18
And so I'm going to return to
that idea and grind a little

597
00:40:18 --> 00:40:24
deeper than we did when I gave
that lecture,

598
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
just before spring break.
I had a coil and I was driving

599
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
that coal, coil with 60 hertz
AC.

600
00:40:36 --> 00:40:40
And let's assume that looking
from above that the current was

601
00:40:40 --> 00:40:44
running in clockwise direction,
which is exactly what I assumed

602
00:40:44 --> 00:40:49
when I discussed this with you,
and so the magnetic field is

603
00:40:49 --> 00:40:53
coming down like this --
magnetic dipole field --

604
00:40:53 --> 00:40:58
produced by this coil.
And then we had here,

605
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
we had a conducting plate under
there, and I said to you when

606
00:41:03 --> 00:41:05
this magnetic field is
increasing in strength,

607
00:41:05 --> 00:41:09
then there's going to be an
induced EMF here,

608
00:41:09 --> 00:41:12
which tries to imp-,
oppose that change,

609
00:41:12 --> 00:41:15
and so the induced current that
is going to run,

610
00:41:15 --> 00:41:19
which we call eddy current,
is going to run in this

611
00:41:19 --> 00:41:21
direction.
If this is clockwise,

612
00:41:21 --> 00:41:24
this current is going to be
counter clockwise,

613
00:41:24 --> 00:41:27
so it's going to produce a
magnetic field in this

614
00:41:27 --> 00:41:29
direction.
It opposes the change of the

615
00:41:29 --> 00:41:32
increasing magnetic field:
Lenz's Law.

616
00:41:32 --> 00:41:35
And since the two currents are
in opposite direction,

617
00:41:35 --> 00:41:42
the two repel each other.
And you bought off on that,

618
00:41:42 --> 00:41:45
and we levitated a woman.
However, no one asked me the

619
00:41:45 --> 00:41:50
question, what happens a little
later in time when the magnetic

620
00:41:50 --> 00:41:54
field is still in the downward
direction but it is decreasing,

621
00:41:54 --> 00:41:57
since it is an AC current,
there comes a time that the

622
00:41:57 --> 00:41:59
magnetic field will be
decreasing in time.

623
00:41:59 --> 00:42:03
Now the EMF here must flip over
because Lenz says sorry,

624
00:42:03 --> 00:42:06
we don't like the decrease.
The moment that the EMF flips

625
00:42:06 --> 00:42:08
over, this current will flip
over.

626
00:42:08 --> 00:42:11
The two currents are now in the
same

627
00:42:11 --> 00:42:14
direction, and they will
attract each other,

628
00:42:14 --> 00:42:16
and so there goes your magnetic
levitation.

629
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
Half the time attraction,
half the time they repel each

630
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24
other.
But yet we did elev- levitate a

631
00:42:24 --> 00:42:31
woman, and the secret lies in
the self-inductance.

632
00:42:31 --> 00:42:37
This current that runs here
runs over a path -- which is

633
00:42:37 --> 00:42:40
very difficult for me to
anticipate -- which has a

634
00:42:40 --> 00:42:41
certain resistance,

635
00:42:41 --> 00:42:44
R; and it has a certain
self-inductance,

636
00:42:44 --> 00:42:47
L.
We know what omega is;

637
00:42:47 --> 00:42:49
that's about 360.

638
00:42:49 --> 00:42:54
And so we do get in this
conductor, we get the current,

639
00:42:54 --> 00:43:00
the induced current here,
is delayed by a phase angle

640
00:43:00 --> 00:43:04
given by this equation,
is delayed over the induced

641
00:43:04 --> 00:43:09
EMF.
The EMF immediately coupled to

642
00:43:09 --> 00:43:12
what this coil is doing,
but the induced current is

643
00:43:12 --> 00:43:16
delayed.
And I have something that will

644
00:43:16 --> 00:43:17
allow
that, allow you to see that,

645
00:43:17 --> 00:43:24
perhaps in even more detail.
This red curve is the

646
00:43:31 --> 00:43:34
current through the coil,
the coil that you see there

647
00:43:34 --> 00:43:38
above.
And when the current is above

648
00:43:38 --> 00:43:41
the black line it's clockwise
and when it is below the black

649
00:43:41 --> 00:43:43
line it's counter clockwise.
The vertical scales are

650
00:43:43 --> 00:43:48
arbitrary.
The green curve is the EMF,

651
00:43:48 --> 00:43:53
which is induced in the
conductor.

652
00:43:53 --> 00:43:56
Notice when the magnetic field
increases, when the current goes

653
00:43:56 --> 00:44:01
up in the coil,
that the EMF in the conductor

654
00:44:01 --> 00:44:05
is in such a direction that it
opposes the change of that

655
00:44:05 --> 00:44:09
magnetic field.
But now when the magnetic

656
00:44:09 --> 00:44:12
field goes down,
when the current in the coil

657
00:44:12 --> 00:44:15
goes down, immediately the EMF
flips over, which is what I just

658
00:44:15 --> 00:44:21
mentioned to you,
and therefore if the induced

659
00:44:21 --> 00:44:23
current and the induced EMF were
in

660
00:44:23 --> 00:44:27
phase with each other,
half the time you would have

661
00:44:27 --> 00:44:31
attraction and half the time you
would have that the two repel

662
00:44:31 --> 00:44:36
each other, and that won't give
you magnetic levitation.

663
00:44:36 --> 00:44:43
Here, what you see is a blue
curve which represents the

664
00:44:43 --> 00:44:46
induced current.
I call it the eddy current.

665
00:44:46 --> 00:44:51
If there is no phase shift
between the induced EMF and the

666
00:44:51 --> 00:44:56
induced current,
notice that half the time

667
00:44:56 --> 00:44:59
the blue curve and the red
curve are in opposite direction.

668
00:44:59 --> 00:45:01
When they are in opposite
direction they repel each other.

669
00:45:01 --> 00:45:03
When they are in the same
direction they attract each

670
00:45:03 --> 00:45:08
other.
But now, if I have a phase

671
00:45:08 --> 00:45:13
delay so that the induced
current comes later than the EMF

672
00:45:13 --> 00:45:16
-- and I'm going to do something
dramatic, I'm going to shift it

673
00:45:16 --> 00:45:20
by 90 degrees so the current
is now 90 degrees delayed

674
00:45:20 --> 00:45:25
relative to the induced EMF --
look now that the red curve and

675
00:45:25 --> 00:45:27
the blue curve are always in
opposite direction.

676
00:45:27 --> 00:45:30
And so now there is hundred
percent of the time a repelling

677
00:45:30 --> 00:45:32
force.
The coil repels the conductor

678
00:45:32 --> 00:45:35
and the conductor repels the
coil.

679
00:45:35 --> 00:45:38
Now in the case when we
levitated the woman,

680
00:45:38 --> 00:45:41
I am sure that the phase delay
was not 90 degrees but maybe

681
00:45:41 --> 00:45:45
it was only 30 or 40
degrees, but the net result is

682
00:45:45 --> 00:45:49
here the shift is not 90
degrees, the net result is that

683
00:45:49 --> 00:45:52
you get, on average,
a repelling force.

684
00:45:52 --> 00:45:55
And so, the secret of the
repelling force,

685
00:45:55 --> 00:46:00
in the case of the levitation
of this coil and therefore of

686
00:46:00 --> 00:46:03
the levitation of the woman,
lies in the fact that there

687
00:46:03 --> 00:46:06
is a finite self-inductance
[tapping noise] in here.

688
00:46:06 --> 00:46:12
If R is 0,
then of course we have a super

689
00:46:12 --> 00:46:16
conductor, then phi is always
90 degrees.

690
00:46:16 --> 00:46:19
When R is 0,
this is infinitely high,

691
00:46:19 --> 00:46:21
so now we get a 90 degree
phase shift, and I did a

692
00:46:21 --> 00:46:24
demonstration whereby I
had a little magnet floating

693
00:46:24 --> 00:46:28
above a superconductor.
That was an ideal case.

694
00:46:28 --> 00:46:31
Phi was then 90 degrees,
so they always repel each

695
00:46:31 --> 00:46:34
other.
Today I want to do a more

696
00:46:34 --> 00:46:37
controlled demonstration,
whereby I can actually

697
00:46:37 --> 00:46:42
calculate the self-inductance
and I also can calculate the

698
00:46:42 --> 00:46:45
resistance.
And what I will do today is I

699
00:46:45 --> 00:46:50
will have a coil which is
stationary, and I will have a

700
00:46:50 --> 00:46:52
conductor which is not
stationary.

701
00:46:52 --> 00:46:59
Here is my coil.
AC, 60 hertz.

702
00:47:00 --> 00:47:07
There's the coil.
And I have a ring,

703
00:47:08 --> 00:47:11
and the ring is made of
aluminum, and I know exactly the

704
00:47:11 --> 00:47:13
dimensions of this ring.
I know the radius -- it's about

705
00:47:13 --> 00:47:15
5 centimeters -- I know the
thickness, I know everything.

706
00:47:15 --> 00:47:21
It's an aluminum ring and has a
radius of about 5

707
00:47:21 --> 00:47:23
centimeters.
Since I know all the

708
00:47:23 --> 00:47:25
dimensions,
I can calculate the resistance

709
00:47:25 --> 00:47:28
of that ring.
You should be able to do that,

710
00:47:28 --> 00:47:30
too, if I gave you the
dimensions.

711
00:47:30 --> 00:47:35
And so the resistance of that
ring very roughly is about 7

712
00:47:35 --> 00:47:37
times 10 to the minus 5
ohms.

713
00:47:37 --> 00:47:42
It's very small.
I can all-, this is at room

714
00:47:42 --> 00:47:44
temperature, by the way,
the lower temperature the

715
00:47:44 --> 00:47:47
resistance is lower.
I can also calculate very

716
00:47:47 --> 00:47:49
roughly what the self-inductance
is of that ring.

717
00:47:49 --> 00:47:53
Now that's not so easy,
because here when I calculated

718
00:47:53 --> 00:47:56
the self-inductance,
the magnetic

719
00:47:56 --> 00:47:58
field was constant.
I assumed it was constant,

720
00:47:58 --> 00:48:00
uniform inside.
That's not the case when you

721
00:48:00 --> 00:48:03
have a ring.
You have a dipole field.

722
00:48:03 --> 00:48:06
However, I just assumed that
the magnetic field was the same

723
00:48:06 --> 00:48:10
everywhere at the surface of the
ring -- and with that assumption

724
00:48:10 --> 00:48:13
admittedly I could be off maybe
by 20 or 30% --

725
00:48:13 --> 00:48:17
with that assumption I find that
the self-inductance is 10 to

726
00:48:17 --> 00:48:21
the minus 7 Henry.
I know what the omega is.

727
00:48:21 --> 00:48:25
It's 360,
roughly, and so I find that

728
00:48:25 --> 00:48:30
omega L over R
for this ring is about one

729
00:48:30 --> 00:48:34
half, run at that frequency
omega.

730
00:48:34 --> 00:48:41
And that gives me a phase angle
phi of 25 degrees,

731
00:48:42 --> 00:48:47
and therefore the ring is going
to be repelled by the coil and

732
00:48:47 --> 00:48:50
of course the coil is going to
be repelled by the ring.

733
00:48:50 --> 00:48:54
I'll put the ring here,
and the ring is supported by

734
00:48:54 --> 00:48:59
this, so this ring cannot fall
over.

735
00:48:59 --> 00:49:00
The only difference between
this

736
00:49:00 --> 00:49:03
experiment and that one is
first of all I can be very

737
00:49:03 --> 00:49:05
quantitative there,
I can actually calculate the

738
00:49:05 --> 00:49:09
phase angle, where here that's
almost impossible.

739
00:49:09 --> 00:49:12
Here, it is the conductor that
I'm going to make levitate and

740
00:49:12 --> 00:49:15
the coil is stationary.
In here it was the conductor

741
00:49:15 --> 00:49:17
that was stationary,
and the coil is floating,

742
00:49:17 --> 00:49:21
but of course the idea is
exactly the same.

743
00:49:21 --> 00:49:25
And so what I want to do now is
make you see it there,

744
00:49:25 --> 00:49:31
actually, hmmmm,

745
00:49:31 --> 00:49:38
and we'll have to,
it should come up there.

746
00:49:38 --> 00:49:41
Yes, there you see this,

747
00:49:41 --> 00:49:43
this ring.
Maybe I should first show you

748
00:49:43 --> 00:49:49
the whole setup.
So this ring goes over here --

749
00:49:49 --> 00:49:53
this is an aluminum ring -- and
I'm going to make it levitate by

750
00:49:53 --> 00:49:57
simply running 60 hertz, 110 volts through
this coil and

751
00:49:57 --> 00:50:02
I hope I do nothing wrong.
Oh no, I have to turn on my AC.

752
00:50:02 --> 00:50:05
Oh my God, that was not,
gee, that

753
00:50:05 --> 00:50:07
was not my intention.
A good thing we don't have a

754
00:50:07 --> 00:50:09
woman sitting on the ring now.
My idea was to have it

755
00:50:09 --> 00:50:11
levitate.
By the way, you did see that it

756
00:50:11 --> 00:50:14
was repelled,
that was quite clear.

757
00:50:14 --> 00:50:17
I had the current too high.
[laughter] I had the current

758
00:50:17 --> 00:50:20
too high so we'll have it a
little lower,

759
00:50:20 --> 00:50:24
and I will make the current
come up very slowly and then I

760
00:50:24 --> 00:50:26
want you to see that it
levitates.

761
00:50:26 --> 00:50:29
There it is,
levitating.

762
00:50:29 --> 00:50:32
Oh, oh, off the screen.
There it is.

763
00:50:32 --> 00:50:36
And I can turn it over and it's
still levitating,

764
00:50:36 --> 00:50:40
of course.
And the secret is this phase

765
00:50:40 --> 00:50:42
delay introduced by the
self-inductance.

766
00:50:42 --> 00:50:46
I have another ring here which
has a, a slot -- also aluminum

767
00:50:46 --> 00:50:49
-- same ring,
but it has a slot.

768
00:50:49 --> 00:50:54
Well, the EMF in this ring is
going to be identical.

769
00:50:54 --> 00:50:56
There's no difference.
In fact, the self-inductance of

770
00:50:56 --> 00:51:01
this ring is identical,
but the resistance of this ring

771
00:51:01 --> 00:51:05
is huge because there's a slot
in there and the resistance is

772
00:51:05 --> 00:51:08
almost infinitely high.
And so if the resistance is

773
00:51:08 --> 00:51:10
infinitely high,

774
00:51:10 --> 00:51:13
no matter what L is and what
omega is, phi is going to be

775
00:51:13 --> 00:51:17
0.
It won't repel.

776
00:51:17 --> 00:51:20
Half the time it attracts,
half the time it repels.

777
00:51:20 --> 00:51:22
[metallic clanking sound] That
means nothing happens,

778
00:51:22 --> 00:51:26
no magnetic levitation.
Same EMF, same self-inductance,

779
00:51:26 --> 00:51:30
but an infinite resistance and
here you see magnetic

780
00:51:30 --> 00:51:33
levitation.
Since the induced current in

781
00:51:33 --> 00:51:36
the ring is extremely small
because of its very high

782
00:51:36 --> 00:51:39
resistance, the force on the
ring -- whether it's repelling

783
00:51:39 --> 00:51:39
or attracting

784
00:51:39 --> 00:51:43
-- in any case is practically
0.

785
00:51:43 --> 00:51:47
So that alone is enough reason
for the ring not to move at all.

786
00:51:47 --> 00:51:50
All right, I hope to see all of
you tomorrow during our exciting

787
00:51:50 --> 00:51:52
testing of the motors.
