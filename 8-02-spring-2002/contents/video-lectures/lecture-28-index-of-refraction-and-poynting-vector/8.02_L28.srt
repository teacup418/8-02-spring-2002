00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,336



2
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:06,024
I'm going to talk today about
energy in electromagnetic waves.

3
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:11,527
There must be energy in there,
because we know that electric

4
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:16,096
fields contain energy,
and magnetic fields contain

5
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:19,454
energy.
And you may remember that the

6
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:25,422
electric field energy density is
one-half epsilon zero E squared,

7
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:31,111
this is now in joules per cubic
meter, and the magnetic energy

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,988
field
density, which also has come up

9
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:41,456
earlier in the course,
is one over two mu zero times B

10
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:45,377
squared.
Again, joules per cubic meter.

11
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:49,917
Now, we -- when we deal with
traveling waves,

12
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:55,695
in vacuum, at any moment in
time, the magnitude of B is E

13
00:00:55,695 --> 00:01:00,132
divided by C.
So this is also one divided by

14
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:05,909
two mu zero, I can replace this
by E squared

15
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,492
divided by C squared.
But C squared is one over

16
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:12,997
epsilon zero my zero.
So this is also one-half

17
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:16,501
epsilon zero E squared.
And when you see this,

18
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:21,174
this is an absolutely amazing
result, because what this tells

19
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:25,535
you is that the energy density
in the magnetic field of a

20
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:30,052
traveling wave is exactly the
same as the energy density in

21
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:33,557
the electric field of an
electromagnetic wave.

22
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:39,806
That's really an amazing thing,
the symmetry is absolutely

23
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:43,907
beautiful.
So the total energy density is

24
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:48,009
the sum of the two,
so I double this one,

25
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:53,956
so that it's epsilon zero E
squared joules per cubic meter,

26
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:58,058
and of course,
I can also write for that,

27
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:02,57
epsilon zero,
just one E, and then the other,

28
00:02:02,57 --> 00:02:07,492
I write B times C.
So I write for E,

29
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:10,245
B times C.
So this is, again,

30
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:15,26
in joules per cubic meter.
Yes, I'm happy with that,

31
00:02:15,26 --> 00:02:18,603
that's fine.
Now, I want to ask the

32
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:23,028
question, if electromagnetic
waves come by me,

33
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:27,65
how much energy passes through
one square meter?

34
00:02:27,65 --> 00:02:32,96
It's like an energy flux.
And so I have here one square

35
00:02:32,96 --> 00:02:37,68
meter, and this one square meter
is

36
00:02:37,68 --> 00:02:42,219
perpendicular to the direction
that the electromagnetic wave is

37
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:46,685
going, and I want to know how
much energy flows through there.

38
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:49,907
One square meter every second.
In one second,

39
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:54,154
light travels a distance C,
which is a horrendous distance,

40
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:56,57
three hundred thousand
kilometers.

41
00:02:56,57 --> 00:03:00,743
This side of this box is what
light travels in one second.

42
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:05,063
And this is one square meter,
and I'm going to calculate how

43
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:10,555
energy now goes through this one
square meter in one second.

44
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:14,658
Of course, I could have chosen
this box a billion times

45
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:18,61
smaller, would have gotten the
same answer of course,

46
00:03:18,61 --> 00:03:21,802
but for convenience,
I choose this to be C,

47
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,158
and this to be one square
meter.

48
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,425
So the volume of that box is C
cubic meters.

49
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:32,137
And all the energy of that box
is going to come out here in one

50
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:36,545
second, because I know that
electromagnetic waves move with

51
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,825
the speed of light,
which is C.

52
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:44,113
And so therefore,
the energy that comes out here

53
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:49,614
per square meter per second is
that U total there that I have,

54
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:54,212
which is the amount of energy
for every cubic meter,

55
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:57,007
but I have so many cubic
meters.

56
00:03:57,007 --> 00:04:02,417
And so I can use this result,
now, here, and I can substitute

57
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:08,188
that here, so I get epsilon zero
times E times B times C squared.

58
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:11,434
I have to multiply it by this C
here.

59
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:16,843
And this, of course,
is also E times B divided

60
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:23,393
by mu zero, because C squared,
in vacuum, is one over epsilon

61
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:26,449
zero, mu zero.
And this, now,

62
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,597
is joules per square meter,
per second.

63
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:35,836
Because in one second,
all that energy comes out,

64
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:40,966
and I have already chosen one
square meter area.

65
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:45,66
Let me see whether I'm happy
with that, yes,

66
00:04:45,66 --> 00:04:52,047
I'm happy with that.
We call this the pointing

67
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:54,61
vector.
And we write it,

68
00:04:54,61 --> 00:04:58,51
in general as a vector.
We write it,

69
00:04:58,51 --> 00:05:03,413
S with a vector,
and it's called the pointing

70
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:08,538
vector with a Y,
and we write that as E cross B

71
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:13,218
divided by mu zero.
E B divided by mu zero.

72
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:19,793
You don't need the cross,
really, because E and

73
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:24,323
B are always perpendicular to
each other in a traveling wave.

74
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:28,854
The advantage of this notation
is that S, which is the energy

75
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:32,857
flux, goes in a certain
direction, and the velocity of

76
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:36,557
the weave is always in the
direction of E cross B,

77
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:40,257
so it also tells you,
then, in which direction the

78
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,825
radiation is flowing,
whereas here,

79
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,241
you -- you lack that
information.

80
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,657
And so this,
then, to remind you,

81
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:50,905
is in these units,
which is watts per square

82
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:54,934
meter.
How many joules per second?

83
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:59,059
One square meter through a
plane perpendicular to the

84
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:03,421
direction of propagation.
Now, E and B are changing with

85
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:07,229
a frequency omega,
cosines omega T or sines omega

86
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,688
T.
And so S is changing with the

87
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:14,05
cosine square of omega T.
If you are somewhere in space,

88
00:06:14,05 --> 00:06:18,889
and this electromagnetic wave
comes by, there are moments that

89
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,966
S is zero, namely,
when E and B happen to be zero.

90
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,074
And there are moments that it
is at maximum,

91
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,676
when E and B happen to be at
maximum.

92
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:33,29
And so when we deal with
electromagnetic radiation,

93
00:06:33,29 --> 00:06:37,194
it's more meaningful to discuss
the time-average value.

94
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:40,953
And the time-average value of
the pointing vector is,

95
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:44,061
first of all,
the time-average of the cosine

96
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,097
square omega T,
or the sine square omega T,

97
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:51,145
whatever the case may be.
And the average value of cosine

98
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,919
squared is
one-half.

99
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,482
And then I can write now,
for E, E zero,

100
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:02,964
and for B, I can write B zero,
which is now the maximum value

101
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:08,081
possible, divided by mu zero.
And if you want to write it

102
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:13,015
differently, if you want to
write it only in terms of E

103
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:18,497
zero, then you can write down
one-half E zero squared divided

104
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:22,883
by mu zero times C.
So this is the more practical

105
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:27,014
equation,
that gives you a number which

106
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,675
is time-averaged over the
oscillations.

107
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:33,805
Let me make sure that there is
nowhere, a slip of the pen --

108
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:37,305
no, there isn't -- I hate to
have slips of the pen,

109
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:41,154
because you can't edit them out
later on your videotape.

110
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:43,675
Slips of the tongue,
you can edit it.

111
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,845
The slips of the pen,
you can't.

112
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:49,065
OK, this looks good.
So now, we have an average

113
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:52,845
value for the pointing vector,
and so we can calculate,

114
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:56,589
now,
how much energy flows through

115
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:00,997
one square meter per second.
And I can give you an example,

116
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:04,265
suppose I have a plane
electromagnetic wave,

117
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:07,381
and E zero is one hundred volts
per meter.

118
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:10,194
That's just what it is,
how we get it,

119
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:13,842
that's a different story.
And this could be radio

120
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:17,642
emission, this could infrared,
this could be light,

121
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:20,226
I d- I don't specify the
frequency.

122
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:23,342
I don't have to.
Frequency doesn't come up

123
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:28,351
there.
And so the value for -- average

124
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:34
value for the pointing vector,
I can pick this equation.

125
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37,39
E zero is hundred.
I know mu zero,

126
00:08:37,39 --> 00:08:41,396
I know C, so I can calculate
what it is.

127
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,402
It's one hundred squared
divided by two,

128
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:48,689
divided by mu zero,
divided by C.

129
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:53,517
And when I do that,
I find that this is thirteen

130
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:56,773
watts
per square meter.

131
00:08:56,773 --> 00:09:01,298
So imagine that you would stand
in this electromagnetic wave

132
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:04,75
coming to you,
we take all our clothes off and

133
00:09:04,75 --> 00:09:08,125
we let it hit us,
and suppose it absorbed us.

134
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:12,727
Suppose it is radiation that
absorbs us -- some radiation may

135
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:15,872
go through you.
Gamma rays may go straight

136
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:19,631
through you -- they are
electromagnetic radiation.

137
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:23,006
But certainly,
light will not go through you.

138
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:26,074
And radio waves,
some of them will not go

139
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:30,352
through you.
So you observe them with your

140
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,192
body.
Would you notice that?

141
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:34,781
I doubt it.
You probably have a surface

142
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:37,303
area that's close to one square
meter.

143
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:40,165
Thirteen watts,
thirteen joules per second,

144
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:42,345
not very noticeable.
You radiate,

145
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:45,753
yourself, hundred watts,
hundred joules per second,

146
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,274
so I don't think you will
notice that.

147
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,204
But imagine,
now, that we increase the value

148
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:54,612
of E zero, and we make it
thousand volts per meter.

149
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:58,292
Now, this goes up by a factor
of a

150
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:01,665
hundred, because if E goes up
by a factor of ten,

151
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:04,827
automatically,
B goes up by a factor of ten --

152
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:08,903
remember, in electromagnetic
waves, they're always coupled.

153
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:12,416
So the pointing vector,
which is the product of the

154
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,579
two, goes up by a factor of a
hundred, so now,

155
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:19,514
you're talking about one point
three kilowatts per square

156
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:22,044
meter.
And if you absorb that on your

157
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,573
body, believe me,
uh, it may fry you.

158
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:28,72
Certainly if you do that out on
the beach,

159
00:10:28,72 --> 00:10:32,832
you get a -- a deep suntan.
And if you do it long enough,

160
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,549
then you can hurt yourself very
badly.

161
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:39,514
So now comes the question,
does a light bulb emit plane

162
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,203
waves?
Well, not really.

163
00:10:41,203 --> 00:10:44,875
Plane waves have no beginning
and they have no end,

164
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,518
they exist at all time and all
space.

165
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:51,117
Look at my plane wave solutions
from last lecture.

166
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,495
You can substitute in there any
value for X, Y,

167
00:10:54,495 --> 00:11:00,076
and Z, and any moment in time,
the year five thousand B.C.,

168
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,676
you get an answer.
Doesn't specify when,

169
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:06,078
doesn't specify where.
And of course that's not very

170
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,945
realistic.
In the real world,

171
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:12,08
there is a beginning and there
is an end to the electromagnetic

172
00:11:12,08 --> 00:11:15,815
radiation, and therefore,
they have also a finite length.

173
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:19,949
Remember the quarter-nanosecond
pulses that we sent to the moon

174
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,151
that we discussed last time.
They were only seven

175
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:26,085
centimeters long.
That's not very much like a

176
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:30,086
plane wave.
So I want to discuss with you a

177
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:34,377
little further what these waves
look like, and I want to take a

178
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:37,353
closer look at how
electromagnetic waves are

179
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:40,26
produced by charges that we
begin to shake,

180
00:11:40,26 --> 00:11:43,859
that we are accelerating.
Key in the whole process is

181
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:48,011
that you accelerate a charge.
If a charge is just moving at a

182
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,572
constant velocity,
it will not produce

183
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:54,24
electromagnetic radiation.
But I want to give you some

184
00:11:54,24 --> 00:11:58,462
feeling, at least some classical
physical feeling on how these

185
00:11:58,462 --> 00:12:02,052
electromagnetic
waves are produced.

186
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:05,239
It is a picture that has its
own limitations,

187
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,932
but it's still useful.
It's not a quantum mechanical

188
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:12,988
treatment, but it is something
that you and I can see and

189
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:15,16
therefore, perhaps,
appreciate.

190
00:12:15,16 --> 00:12:18,636
Suppose I have here a charge
which is not moving.

191
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:21,605
Just sitting there.
These are field lines,

192
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:24,068
I just draw only a few field
lines.

193
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,978
And if it's a positive charge,
the arrows are outwards,

194
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:33,338
if it's a negative charge,
the arrows are inwards.

195
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:38,156
And I'm going to accelerate
this for a time delta T.

196
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:41,652
Let's accelerate it in this
direction.

197
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:45,809
And then we bring it,
again, to a halt state.

198
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,966
I redraw this.
This point is the same as this

199
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,517
point here.
I accelerate it,

200
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:57,052
and delta T seconds later,
it happens to be here.

201
00:12:57,052 --> 00:13:01,493
So this is T zero,
and this is T equals delta T.

202
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:06,5
And now I'm going to draw a
circle --

203
00:13:06,5 --> 00:13:13,68
it should actually be a sphere,
three-dimensionally -- about

204
00:13:13,68 --> 00:13:17,939
this point.
And here is that sphere.

205
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:22,319
And this sphere has radius C
delta T.

206
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:27,795
This field line,
which was the field line that

207
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:34,245
goes with this charge,
is here, and this field line is

208
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,832
here,
and this one is here,

209
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,722
I only draw three.
This one, this one,

210
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:43,456
and this one.
And the message that I

211
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:48,065
accelerated this charge could
not possibly have reached this

212
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:51,736
location in space,
because that message can only

213
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:56,423
travel with the speed of light.
So the electric field here is

214
00:13:56,423 --> 00:14:00,251
exactly the same as it was when
it was still here.

215
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:04,626
So when the object is here,
the electric field must still

216
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:09,477
be like this here,
and it must be like this here,

217
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:13,648
and it must be like this there,
because the message hasn't

218
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:17,161
reached that point.
But now, look at this charge,

219
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,723
which is now here at time D
delta T.

220
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:23,089
Now, the electric field is like
so, is like so,

221
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,456
and is like so.
So this field line must somehow

222
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:30,042
meet up with this one,
it's one and the same field

223
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,164
line.
And what does that mean?

224
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,677
That somewhere there,
there must be a kink in the

225
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:39,922
electric field.
And there must be a kink

226
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,635
here.
Notice there is no kink here,

227
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:46,706
which is interesting.
And so it is the collection of

228
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:50,936
these kinks that propagate
outwards, with the speed of

229
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:55,246
light, and they produce an
electromagnetic disturbance,

230
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:58,359
a change.
If you were out in space here,

231
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:02,509
and if, for instance,
I were to oscillate this charge

232
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:06,18
back and forth,
you would see these kinks go by

233
00:15:06,18 --> 00:15:10,011
all the time,
these breaks in the

234
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:13,325
electric field,
and you would experience that

235
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:17,692
as an electromagnetic wave,
if there is a changing electric

236
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:22,21
field, according to Maxwell's
equations, there has to be also

237
00:15:22,21 --> 00:15:26,351
a changing magnetic field.
But the interesting thing is,

238
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:29,89
even though this is an
extremely simple picture,

239
00:15:29,89 --> 00:15:33,429
notice that in this direction,
if you were here,

240
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:37,721
you would not see any kinks.
So there's no electromagnetic

241
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:41,41
radiation going in this
direction,

242
00:15:41,41 --> 00:15:44,033
nor is there any going in this
direction.

243
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,787
And the maximum is going in
this direction,

244
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:50,132
and something in between is
going in that direction.

245
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:53,148
It's not much of a plane wave,
for that matter.

246
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:56,164
I mean, if anything,
it's more like a spherical

247
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58
wave.
But it's a very special

248
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00,82
spherical wave,
not the same strength in all

249
00:16:00,82 --> 00:16:03,377
directions.
And so even though this is a

250
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,803
rather classical picture,
it helps me,

251
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:09,541
at least, to see how these
changing electric fields -- and

252
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,523
therefore,
associated B fields -- are

253
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:16,222
formed by charges that we
accelerate.

254
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:19,596
And I have a two-minute movie
that shows that,

255
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:23,72
also, in a slightly more
detailed way that I was able to

256
00:16:23,72 --> 00:16:25,819
do.
And so let's look at that

257
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,294
movie, Marcos,
you ready for that?

258
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:32,717
OK, then you can start that.
So this is a computer-generated

259
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:35,342
movie whereby we accelerate
charges.

260
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:39,316
This is a constant speed,
now, and we're going to stop

261
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:42,914
it.
Stopping means there is an

262
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:43,963
acceleration,
right?

263
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,665
You may call it a deceleration,
but stopping is an

264
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,761
acceleration.
It's going to be stopped.

265
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,637
And you see now,
here, these kinks?

266
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:53,174
And they propagate out with the
speed of light,

267
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:55,546
then, if this was
electromagnetic radiation.

268
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,642
You're going to see this
several times,

269
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,566
so you get another chance.
Your charge is now stopped,

270
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:03,82
you see the magnetic -- the
electric field lines coming out,

271
00:17:03,82 --> 00:17:07,13
and now it's being accelerated.
And you see these kinks here?

272
00:17:07,13 --> 00:17:09,005
Moving out with the speed of
light.

273
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:11,046
You're going to see more.
There it is,

274
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:16,334
it's going to be accelerated,
and doing the acceleration,

275
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:21,382
only during the acceleration do
you see the formation of the

276
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:24,718
kinks, when it goes with
constant speed,

277
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:28,397
no longer, it's only during --
now it stops.

278
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:33,274
Stops means an acceleration.
There you see this wave front

279
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:36,867
moving out.
Let's look a little bit more as

280
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:39,776
you can see the oscillating
effect.

281
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:44,738
So you already have seen this,
acceleration,

282
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:47,363
here is the wave,
it stops, that means

283
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:50,059
deceleration,
and here you see the wave

284
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,471
front.
And when it's sitting still,

285
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,167
or when it's going with
constant speed,

286
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:58,431
then there is no
electromagnetic wave produced.

287
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:01,766
Now we're going to see some
oscillating charges,

288
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:05,172
which is more realistic when
you have an antenna,

289
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:09,358
and you have current going up
and down with frequency omega,

290
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:13,473
you obviously have stops and
starts, it oscillates back and

291
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:17,305
forth, and that's what you see
now.

292
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:22,216
And look at these beautiful --
there's a wave going out,

293
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:26,949
here's a wave going out,
only during the acceleration.

294
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:31,236
There's one going out,
and there's one going out,

295
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:35,612
so you accelerated backwards,
forwards, backwards,

296
00:18:35,612 --> 0.
forwards.

297
0. --> 00:18:36,505

298
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:39,898
I think that's fine,
thank you, Marcos.

299
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:44,274
So the classic picture,
even though it has lots of

300
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:49,99
limitations, it's not a quantum
mechanical

301
00:18:49,99 --> 00:18:52,26
treatment, is still very
useful.

302
00:18:52,26 --> 00:18:55,483
For instance,
if we think of a -- an antenna,

303
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:59,439
just a straight wire with a
current, going up and down,

304
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:03,101
with high frequency,
it could be seventy megaHertz,

305
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,764
could be gigaHertz,
and you produce electromagnetic

306
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:10,793
radiation, then you are
accelerating charges up and down

307
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:15,041
by having current going like
this, then from this classical

308
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,924
picture, we know that no
radiation will go out in this

309
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,654
direction.
But we also know that in the

310
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:25,347
direction perpendicular to the
acceleration,

311
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:28,039
that is in this direction --
remember, here,

312
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,67
the acceleration was like so --
and in the direction of the

313
00:19:31,67 --> 00:19:34,174
acceleration,
no electromagnetic waves go

314
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,99
out.
So nothing goes out here,

315
00:19:35,99 --> 00:19:39,308
nothing goes out there.
But in the plane perpendicular

316
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:42,125
to A, which, in this case,
was the blackboard,

317
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,88
is a whole plane like this,
and in this case,

318
00:19:44,88 --> 00:19:47,321
of the antenna,
is the horizontal plane,

319
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:50,577
here we have a maximum
radiation going out everywhere

320
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:52,878
in
this plane.

321
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:56,944
And in between somewhere,
it's not zero and it is not the

322
00:19:56,944 --> 00:20:00,067
maximum value.
So now I would like to return

323
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,535
to the idea of the pointing
vector.

324
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,021
Because we talked only about
the pointing vector,

325
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:09,433
we derive that in terms of
plane wave solutions.

326
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:13,718
And we now know that plane wave
solutions are really not too

327
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:16,549
realistic.
Suppose we have the sun here.

328
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,672
And the sun is a really
powerful light bulb,

329
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:22,649
three times ten to the six
watts radiates,

330
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:27,798
largely invisible light,
and in infrared radiation,

331
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:30,354
which is electromagnetic
radiation.

332
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,737
And we are a distance of
hundred fifty million

333
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:37,496
kilometers, here somewhere on
Earth, and therefore,

334
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:41,931
through every square meter in
the direction perpendicular to

335
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:46,141
the line of sight to the sun,
through every square meter,

336
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:50,577
there is about one kilowatt
flowing, one kilowatt per square

337
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:53,208
meter.
And you can calculate that at

338
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:57,794
home to verify that,
that's easy calculation,

339
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:01,597
you know that it is three times
ten to the six joules per

340
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:05,332
second, and if the distance is
hundred and fifty million

341
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:09,272
kilometers, you can calculate
how much of that energy flows

342
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:12,871
through one square meter.
And that's very close to one

343
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,977
kilowatt.
And we will call that,

344
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:18,712
nevertheless -- even though
it's not really a plane wave

345
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:21,633
solution in that sense -- we
will call that,

346
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,874
nevertheless,
the pointing vector.

347
00:21:23,874 --> 00:21:27,405
And I really don't care whether
you

348
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:31,138
think of this as being a plane
electromagnetic wave,

349
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:35,164
or whether you think of it as
more like spherical waves,

350
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:38,677
if you see there,
or even if you want to think of

351
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:42,63
them as individual photons,
and I will come back to the

352
00:21:42,63 --> 00:21:44,972
photons.
As far as I'm concerned,

353
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:48,851
it's all of the above.
But the result is that there is

354
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,34
an energy flux,
every square meter,

355
00:21:51,34 --> 00:21:55,512
aimed in the direction of the
sun, one thousand joules per

356
00:21:55,512 --> 00:22:00,049
second will flow through that.
If you want to

357
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:04,116
hang on to the plane wave
solution, and if you want to put

358
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:08,254
any value at the plane wave
solution, then you have to draw

359
00:22:08,254 --> 00:22:11,393
the consequence that you can
calculate, then,

360
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:15,46
the E zero of that plane wave.
And I really don't know how

361
00:22:15,46 --> 00:22:19,027
meaningful that is,
but then you would then get the

362
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:23,022
equation that one thousand,
that is, the average value of

363
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:25,519
the pointing factor,
that's a given,

364
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,872
is then E zero squared divided
by two mu zero C.

365
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:33,509
We derived that there.
And so you can calculate,

366
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:37,11
now, what E zero is,
and you'll find that E zero is

367
00:22:37,11 --> 00:22:41,07
approximately eight hundred and
seventy volts per meter.

368
00:22:41,07 --> 00:22:44,67
To be frank with you,
I don't quite know what to do

369
00:22:44,67 --> 00:22:48,054
with that number.
It is some equivalent electric

370
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:50,719
field.
But it's really not an electric

371
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:53,599
field, of course,
that you could measure,

372
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,631
because it's not really a plane
wave in the sense that we

373
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:01,663
derived our pointing vector for
the plane wave solutions.

374
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:07,165
So the bizarre thing is that in
physics, you can think of

375
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:10,111
light, for instance,
as a plane wave,

376
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:13,22
you can think of it as
spherical waves,

377
00:23:13,22 --> 00:23:18,13
you can think of it as photons,
and you can choose which ever

378
00:23:18,13 --> 00:23:21,812
fits you best to explain a
certain phenomenon.

379
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:26,476
And it is only in quantum
mechanics where the wave and the

380
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:30,567
photon picture merge.
Let's talk about photons now.

381
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:34,412
That is one aspect of the
electromagnetic waves,

382
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,586
then.
Photons are really individual

383
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:40,49
packages.
Wave trains.

384
00:23:40,49 --> 00:23:43,392
You can think of them as
bullets.

385
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:48,379
Well-defined in time and space.
[Wssshhht], there goes a

386
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:51,281
photon.
That photon has a certain

387
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:56,631
energy which it carries with it.
That means it has a certain

388
00:23:56,631 --> 00:24:00,077
momentum.
And the momentum of a photon,

389
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:05,7
which comes from one of -- the
great work by Albert Einstein --

390
00:24:05,7 --> 00:24:11,231
the momentum of a photon P is
the energy of one photon divided

391
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:15,799
by C.
You just have to take my word

392
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:18,725
for that.
If you ever take special

393
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:23,249
relativity you will understand
this a little better.

394
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:27,151
But give it now -- take it now
at face value.

395
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:31,054
And now, if I shoot many
photons at a target,

396
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:35,134
and these photons,
if they are absorbed by that

397
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:39,302
target, then the target will
experience a force.

398
00:24:39,302 --> 00:24:45,069
Because if the photons carry
momentum, and if the momentum

399
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:47,393
-- photon, photon,
photon, photon,

400
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:51,336
photon -- I feel a force.
You remember from eight oh one,

401
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:54,645
a force is D P D T,
is the transfer of momentum.

402
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:58,658
If I throw rotten tomatoes at
you, then when you get these

403
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:02,39
tomatoes on your face,
they hit you like this and then

404
00:25:02,39 --> 00:25:05,98
they go [pffft] like this,
so they come in a certain

405
00:25:05,98 --> 00:25:09,501
direction, and they lose all
their momentum in that

406
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:12,036
direction.
That gives a force on you,

407
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:15,486
in this direction.
Because that

408
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:20,412
momentum in this direction is
destroyed, but momentum is

409
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:23,816
conserved and so you get that
momentum.

410
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:27,937
If, for instance,
I threw one kilogram tomatoes

411
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:32,864
at you each second -- so one
after another -- on average

412
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:38,417
time, average one kilogram per
second, and if each tomato had a

413
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:43,255
speed of five meters per second
-- and I cal that the X

414
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:47,733
direction -- and here is your
face --

415
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:51,591
they hit your face,
and then they go [plllt] down.

416
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:55,606
So all the momentum in the X
direction is destroyed,

417
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:59,857
then you will experience a
force in that X direction --

418
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:03,794
it's in the X direction -- which
is one times five,

419
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:07,573
which is five newtons.
It's a time-average force.

420
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:11,273
If, for some reason,
the pot- the tomatoes would

421
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:14,737
bounce back with a perfect
elastic collision,

422
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:20,448
like tennis balls would do,
then the momentum transfer is

423
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:24,178
twice, comes in with momentum,
and comes back.

424
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:28,241
So now the momentum transfer is
twice this number,

425
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:31,722
it's not just destroyed,
no, it's reversed.

426
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:35,619
So in that case,
the force on your case would be

427
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,355
double that, would be ten
newtons.

428
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:43,246
And so we can now carry this
further, to our electromagnetic

429
00:26:43,246 --> 00:26:47,474
radiation, and we can return to
our pointing vector.

430
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:54,38
Here, I have one square meter.
And radiation is coming in.

431
00:26:54,38 --> 00:27:00,107
And I know exactly how much
radiation is coming in,

432
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:05,262
for every square meter,
there is this value S.

433
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:10,073
So S, which is an energy,
per square meter,

434
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:14,196
per second.
Remember, that's -- did I

435
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:21,642
mention, of the pointing vector?
If I divide this by C,

436
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:25,833
and I divide this by C,
then look what I have here.

437
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:29,355
I have energy divided by C.
But the energy,

438
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:32,876
in electromagnetic radiation,
divided by C,

439
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:35,726
according to Einstein,
is momentum.

440
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:40,002
And I don't care whether this
is hundred billions of

441
00:27:40,002 --> 00:27:43,104
individual photons,
that's OK with me.

442
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:47,045
That is a momentum.
And so I have now a momentum

443
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:51,32
per unit time that makes it a
force.

444
00:27:51,32 --> 00:27:55,505
But a force per square meter
makes it a pressure.

445
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:59,863
And so this is pressure.
And we call that radiation

446
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:02,74
pressure.
It means that if you are

447
00:28:02,74 --> 00:28:07,186
exposed to bombardment of
electromagnetic radiation,

448
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,934
and you absorb it,
that you feel a pressure.

449
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:15,293
The radiation comes to you,
and you're being pushed

450
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,693
backwards.
And this is the pressure that

451
00:28:18,693 --> 00:28:22,964
you will experience.
It makes a difference whether

452
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:26,456
the
radiation is absorbed,

453
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:30,827
or whether you are capable of
reflecting that radiation,

454
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:35,357
just like with the tomatoes.
And so if I'm trying to be as

455
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:38,536
general as I can -- let me,
first of all,

456
00:28:38,536 --> 00:28:42,669
specify the mean value of S,
that's the only thing in

457
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:45,689
electromagnetic radiation was
mattered.

458
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:49,107
It's the mean value.
So the mean value then,

459
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:54,272
if I divide that by C,
and I multiply that by an --

460
00:28:54,272 --> 00:28:58,005
a vector alpha,
U will come up shortly and tell

461
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:02,468
you what alpha is -- that is now
the radiation pressure.

462
00:29:02,468 --> 00:29:06,85
An alpha, if alpha is one,
then I have full absorption.

463
00:29:06,85 --> 00:29:11,395
All the radiation is absorbed.
If there is no absorption,

464
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:16,263
if it's completely transparent
-- and there is some radiation

465
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:20,483
that goes straight through you
-- then alpha is zero.

466
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:25,19
But if there is hundred percent
reflection --

467
00:29:25,19 --> 00:29:28,51
which can happen,
you can reflect radio waves

468
00:29:28,51 --> 00:29:33,264
from metals with almost hundred
percent reflection -- then alpha

469
00:29:33,264 --> 00:29:35,679
is two.
So that you get twice the

470
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,867
pressure.
If you take the sun,

471
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:41,188
whereby the mean value for S is
one thousand,

472
00:29:41,188 --> 00:29:45,036
you can calculate now,
if you absorb that radiation,

473
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:49,036
over one square meter,
what the pressure would be that

474
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,601
you would experience.
So your body,

475
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:54,771
one square meter,
you expose it to the sun,

476
00:29:54,771 --> 00:30:00,32
in the direction of the sun.
That force is insignificantly

477
00:30:00,32 --> 00:30:02,53
small.
The pressure would only be

478
00:30:02,53 --> 00:30:06,466
three times ten to the minus six
newtons per square meter,

479
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:10,61
because you have to multiply
that number thousand -- you have

480
00:30:10,61 --> 00:30:12,958
to -- not multiply,
divide it by C.

481
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,963
There's not much left over.
And if you hold your hand up in

482
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:20,623
the direction of the sun,
your hand would only have an

483
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:23,731
area maybe of one-hundredth of a
square meter,

484
00:30:23,731 --> 00:30:27,115
that force is unnoticeable.
So in our daily lives,

485
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:31,839
we don't experience radiation
pressure very much.

486
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,664
Regardless of whether you think
of electromagnetic radiation as

487
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:40,789
plane waves, or you want to
think of them as spherical

488
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:45,225
waves, or you want to think of
them as photons -- I really

489
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:49,972
don't care -- but what matters
as far as radiation pressure is

490
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:54,563
concerned, is how much energy
flow through one square meter,

491
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:58,065
and which fraction of that
energy is absorbed,

492
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,789
or maybe, some of it even
reflected.

493
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:04,525
So the radiation pressure is
not

494
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:08,623
that important in our daily
lives, but is important in

495
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,324
astronomy.
And in fact,

496
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:13,881
you can see it.
Some -- some of you can see it.

497
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:17,824
A comet has two tails,
and one of those tails is the

498
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:22
result of radiation pressure.
A comet is made of carbon

499
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26,021
dioxide, and it has also dust,
it's about the size of

500
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:29,036
Manhattan.
And when it gets close to the

501
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:33,831
sun, the radiation pressure of
the sun, which is this radiation

502
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:37,852
pressure that we just talked
about,

503
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:41,049
pushes onto the dust particles,
forming the tail,

504
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:44,447
and this tail is white light,
white-yellowish light,

505
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:47,911
which is reflected sunlight off
these dust particles.

506
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:51,042
And then there is a second tail
which is bluish,

507
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:55,039
which is hard to see with your
naked eye, and that one is the

508
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,57
result of the solar winds.
We discussed the solar wind

509
00:31:58,57 --> 00:32:02,301
earlier, causes the aurora in
the upper atmosphere of the

510
00:32:02,301 --> 00:32:04,766
Earth.
The solar winds are protons and

511
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:10,096
electrons which are emitted by
the sun in a rather erratic way,

512
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,539
sometimes a lot,
sometimes not so much,

513
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,141
and they move with a speed of
two hundred fifty miles per

514
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,649
second or so,
and they ionize the C O 2.

515
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:22,058
So they excite the molecules
when the [unintelligible]

516
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:25,21
excitation of the molecules,
they emit blue light.

517
00:32:25,21 --> 00:32:28,361
So you get two tails,
and we'll show you these two

518
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:30,419
tails.
The tails can be a hundred

519
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,249
million kilometers in size,
they can be huge.

520
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:36,272
As some of you may remember,
or should remember,

521
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:39,809
in nineteen ninety seven,
we had a fabulous example of a

522
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,99
comet,
which was Hale-Bop.

523
00:32:42,99 --> 00:32:46,183
I watched it every night for
months on end.

524
00:32:46,183 --> 00:32:50,668
This is a picture that you're
going to see of Hale-Bop which

525
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:54,393
is a time-exposure,
it's not what you can see with

526
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:56,522
your naked eye.
And, in fact,

527
00:32:56,522 --> 00:32:59,79
frankly speaking,
I have never seen the blue

528
00:32:59,79 --> 00:33:03,439
tail, but the white tail,
which is the one due to

529
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,176
radiation pressure,
I have seen many,

530
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:08,761
many times.
So let's take a look at

531
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:13,17
Hale-Bop, and there you see it.
And you see clearly the two

532
00:33:13,17 --> 00:33:17,368
tails.
You see the blue tail here,

533
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:22,141
which is the result of the
interaction with the solar wind,

534
00:33:22,141 --> 00:33:27,16
and then here you see the dust
which is the result -- the tail

535
00:33:27,16 --> 00:33:30,04
is the result of radiation
pressure.

536
00:33:30,04 --> 00:33:34,401
The sunlight is absorbed,
fully absorbed by these dust

537
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:38,021
particles, and is pushed away.
I just wonder,

538
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:41,148
who has seen Hale-Bop,
three years ago?

539
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:43,452
Yes?
Just hold your hands up,

540
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:46,907
I'm just curious,
it was a

541
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:50,492
spectacular sight,
and it was easy to see for

542
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:53,017
months on end,
you could see it.

543
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:56,846
You don't see very bright
comets all that often.

544
00:33:56,846 --> 00:34:00,756
So without being very
qualitative in terms of the

545
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:05,237
electric and the magnetic field
strengths, it is easy to

546
00:34:05,237 --> 00:34:09,88
determine the direction of the
oscillating electric field,

547
00:34:09,88 --> 00:34:13,953
if we know in what direction
the charges were being

548
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:18,353
oscillated.
And that has to do with the

549
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:24,874
polarization of the radiation,
and so I would like to send the

550
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:31,074
remaining time today on that.
And let's stick to the center

551
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:34,282
board.
So we have a oscillating

552
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:40,268
charge, being accelerated,
and I will choose a coordinate

553
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:45,079
system like so,
and let's suppose we oscillate

554
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,03
the charge in this
direction.

555
00:34:49,03 --> 00:34:53,881
Acceleration [wssshhht] all the
time, and the frequency is

556
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:56,944
omega.
And we are somewhere in space,

557
00:34:56,944 --> 00:35:00,859
here, and we receive
electromagnetic radiation,

558
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:04,518
we are at point P -- like to
make you see it

559
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:07,752
three-dimensionally.
And at this angle,

560
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:11,326
B theta, and this is the
position vector R,

561
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:15,836
from the origin of the
oscillating charge to where you

562
00:35:15,836 --> 00:35:21,219
are, you are at point P.
And when you are at P,

563
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:26,709
I'm going to give you some very
simple rules which will always

564
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:31,928
allow you to determine the
direction of the electric field.

565
00:35:31,928 --> 00:35:37,148
The electric field is always
perpendicular to the direction

566
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:41,198
position vector,
the direction of propagation.

567
00:35:41,198 --> 00:35:45,607
So you're looking in this
direction to the charge,

568
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:50,557
the electric field that you
experience, if the charge is

569
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:55,269
doing this,
is always perpendicular to R.

570
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:58,749
And A and R and E are always in
one plane.

571
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:03,249
And notice that's the way I
drew it in the blackboard.

572
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:08,004
E and A and R are in one plane.
So it's extremely simple.

573
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:12,588
So if this is oscillating with
angular frequency omega,

574
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:17,512
then this electric field will
also be oscillating with that

575
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:21,672
angular frequency omega.
If you double the charge,

576
00:36:21,672 --> 00:36:25,748
the electric field will double.
If

577
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:29,946
you double the acceleration,
the electric field will also

578
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,571
double.
That's reasonably intuitive.

579
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:37,144
So the electric field strength
is proportional with the charge

580
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:40,218
that you oscillate,
with the acceleration.

581
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:44,492
And then, there comes this
effect that we discussed there,

582
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:48,841
that nothing goes out in the
direction of the acceleration,

583
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:53,114
no energy goes out in this
direction, so no electric field

584
00:36:53,114 --> 00:36:58,91
is produced in this direction,
and the maximum is produced in

585
00:36:58,91 --> 00:37:02,541
this direction,
and somewhere in between here,

586
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:06,334
and that is then reflected by
the sine of theta.

587
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:09,078
If theta is zero,
nothing goes out.

588
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:12,709
If theta is ninety degrees,
you get a maximum.

589
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:16,26
That's the whole plane,
perpendicular to this

590
00:37:16,26 --> 00:37:19,166
oscillating charge,
this whole plane,

591
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:23,523
maximum electric field.
And then -- and that may not be

592
00:37:23,523 --> 00:37:28,365
so obvious to you now -- it's
also inversely

593
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:32,254
proportional to the distance R.
If you double R,

594
00:37:32,254 --> 00:37:36,887
the electric field strength
goes down by a factor of two.

595
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:41,437
And the pointing vector,
which is the product of E and B

596
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:46,567
-- but E is always proportional
to B -- so the pointing vector,

597
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:50,869
then, is proportional to Q
squared, proportional to A

598
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:54,923
squared, proportional to the
sine square of theta,

599
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:58,232
and inversely proportional with
R square.

600
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,753
And
that is obvious,

601
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:04,299
that it has to be inversely
proportional with R squared.

602
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:06,943
Because if you go -- if you
have a sphere,

603
00:38:06,943 --> 00:38:10,296
and radiation goes out,
and you're twice as far away,

604
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:14,293
then you know that the area of
the sphere is four times larger,

605
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:18,291
and so the amount of energy per
square meter must be four times

606
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,418
lower.
So the pointing vector must

607
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:24,094
fall off as one over R squared,
that's the conservation of

608
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,544
energy.
And if you accept the fact that

609
00:38:26,544 --> 00:38:30,025
the pointing vector falls off as
one

610
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:34,885
over R squared,
then the E vector must fall off

611
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:39,534
as one over R,
because the pointing vector is

612
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:45,028
the product of E and B.
E and B must both fall off as

613
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:49,148
one over R.
I want to show you a picture

614
00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:53,903
that may help,
to see you -- how the radiation

615
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:59,925
-- how the electric field is
oriented relative to a charge

616
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:04,42
that we are
accelerating.

617
00:39:04,42 --> 00:39:08,02
In the middle here,
we accelerate a charge,

618
00:39:08,02 --> 00:39:10,42
up and down.
Frequency omega.

619
00:39:10,42 --> 00:39:14,62
Whatever radiation you want to
make, fine with me.

620
00:39:14,62 --> 00:39:18,219
You can make omega as large as
you want to.

621
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:21,819
For one thing,
notice, these -- these waves

622
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,591
here, these snakes,
represent electromagnetic

623
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:28,762
radiation.
And nothing is going out in

624
00:39:28,762 --> 00:39:33,391
this direction.
And we understand why.

625
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:38,146
The maximum is going out in a
plane perpendicular to this

626
00:39:38,146 --> 00:39:40,1
direction.
That is this,

627
00:39:40,1 --> 00:39:44,176
this, this and this.
And notice that the E-vector

628
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:49,017
that you receive when you're
here is perpendicular to R --

629
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:52,074
this is R -- and it is
perpendicular.

630
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:56,49
And notice what I said,
that A and R and E are in one

631
00:39:56,49 --> 00:39:59,462
plane.
A, which is the acceleration,

632
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:02,605
R and E are in one plane.
A, R, and E,

633
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:06,256
are in one plane.
A, R, E, are in one plane.

634
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:10,181
So you
can always determine the

635
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:13,409
direction of the oscillating
electric field.

636
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:17,612
And if you go at an angle
theta, which is neither zero --

637
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:21,966
which it is here -- nor ninety
degrees -- which it is here,

638
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:26,02
here, and here -- but if you
have something in between,

639
00:40:26,02 --> 00:40:30,523
then notice that the E vector
here is drawn a little smaller.

640
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:32,926
And that is that sine theta
here.

641
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:36,228
And consequently,
the pointing vector in that

642
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:39,907
direction will be smaller than
in

643
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:42,866
this direction,
and in this direction,

644
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:45,425
the pointing vector will be
zero.

645
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:49,025
We call this radiation --
whether you're here,

646
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:52,464
or there, or there,
or there -- we call that

647
00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:57,183
linearly polarized radiation,
for the simple reason that the

648
00:40:57,183 --> 00:41:00,862
electric field is oscillating in
one direction.

649
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:04,062
It's linear.
And I'm going to produce for

650
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,821
you linearly polarized
radiation, and I have two

651
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:11,13
demonstrations for
that.

652
00:41:11,13 --> 00:41:17,242
So I'll get the lights back on
again, and let's discuss these

653
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:20,094
demonstrations.
I have, here,

654
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:24,78
a transmitter which transmits
at ten gigaHertz.

655
00:41:24,78 --> 00:41:28,141
That is, uh,
a wavelength of three

656
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:32,317
centimeters.
You wouldn't call that radio,

657
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:37,716
you would call that radar,
but that's just a matter of

658
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:42,708
names.
And we have also a receiver.

659
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,04
We have a transmitter and we
have a receiver.

660
00:41:46,04 --> 00:41:49,75
The transmitter is here,
and the receiver is here.

661
00:41:49,75 --> 00:41:53,007
If I give you a
three-dimensional picture --

662
00:41:53,007 --> 00:41:57,475
this is my coordinate system,
this is coming straight out of

663
00:41:57,475 --> 00:42:01,412
the blackboard to you,
that's what I meant by this --

664
00:42:01,412 --> 00:42:05,426
then the transmitter is aimed
like so, just like this.

665
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:08,758
Current is going to be
oscillating like this.

666
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:13,378
And the receiver -- think of
this as my radio,

667
00:42:13,378 --> 00:42:18,246
which is receiving -- is here.
And the antenna of the radio is

668
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:22,156
also in this direction.
And so, the electric field

669
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:25,428
which you see here,
which comes from these

670
00:42:25,428 --> 00:42:29,418
oscillating charges -- which
oscillate, by the way,

671
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:33,967
at a horrendous frequency,
ten billion times per second --

672
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:37,319
their electric field is
perpendicular to R,

673
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:42,027
this is R, and the electric
fields R and A are in one plane.

674
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:46,018
Ah, so that means that the
electric

675
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:48,99
field that arrives here is
oscillating like so.

676
00:42:48,99 --> 00:42:50,734
And therefore,
this antenna,

677
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,543
this receiver,
is very happy.

678
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,58
The radiation comes in exactly
in the right way,

679
00:42:55,58 --> 00:42:59,134
and so it will receive it.
We have modulated this signal

680
00:42:59,134 --> 00:43:01,847
with an audio signal,
amplitude modulation,

681
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:05,66
as we discussed that earlier,
that you also use with radios.

682
00:43:05,66 --> 00:43:08,761
And we modulated with
approximately one kiloHertz

683
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:11,41
audio signal.
And we'll make you listen to

684
00:43:11,41 --> 00:43:13,672
that audio signal.
And you can tell,

685
00:43:13,672 --> 00:43:18,234
then, that this receiver is,
indeed, receiving the

686
00:43:18,234 --> 00:43:21,16
three-centimeter radar from this
transmitter.

687
00:43:21,16 --> 00:43:24,685
That's what we will first do.
So I'll just turn on the

688
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,811
transmitter [tone],
and here you hear [tone] one

689
00:43:27,811 --> 00:43:30,671
[tone] kiloHertz,
[tone] which is the [tone]

690
00:43:30,671 --> 00:43:33,597
modulated signal,
[tone] and it's received by

691
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:36,523
this antenna,
[tone] which is a straight wire

692
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:39,25
like this, [tone] and this is
the emitter.

693
00:43:39,25 --> 00:43:43,041
[tone] And to demonstrate,
to you that it really goes from

694
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:46,5
here to here,
if I put my hands in

695
00:43:46,5 --> 00:43:49,15
between, my hands absorb three
centimeters.

696
00:43:49,15 --> 00:43:51,8
It's not there anymore.
[tone] There it is.

697
00:43:51,8 --> 00:43:55,523
[tone] It's not there anymore.
But now, [tone] now I'm going

698
00:43:55,523 --> 00:43:58,488
to [tone] rotate this antenna by
ninety degrees,

699
00:43:58,488 --> 00:44:01,895
[tone] so this one is going to
be put in this position.

700
00:44:01,895 --> 00:44:05,555
[tone] So now the electric
fields -- [tone] so I'm going to

701
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:09,278
put it now in this position
[tone] -- so the electric field,

702
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:11,802
now, [tone] is going up and
down like so.

703
00:44:11,802 --> 00:44:15,651
[tone] But the receiver doesn't
like that, because the antenna

704
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:20,473
of the receiver is like this.
[tone] So it cannot [tone]

705
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:23,783
drive any current.
And so you won't have anything

706
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:26,472
anymore.
[tone] So what it means is that

707
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:30,748
I have changed the direction of
polarization by ninety degrees,

708
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:33,437
[tone] and the receiver cannot
see that.

709
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,748
[tone] I'm going to rotate it
now ninety degrees.

710
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:39,782
And it stops.
So now, the electric field goes

711
00:44:39,782 --> 00:44:42,127
like this, [shhhht].
The wire here,

712
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:43,851
the antenna,
is like this,

713
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:47,161
and the wire says,
"Sorry, I can't hear you." But

714
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:52,008
all I have to do now
is rotate the receiver ninety

715
00:44:52,008 --> 00:44:55,68
degrees, and so I can rotate
this antenna and put it

716
00:44:55,68 --> 00:44:59,064
vertical, and then,
of course, it's happy again.

717
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:03,168
So if I rotate this ninety
degrees, [tone] there comes the

718
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:06,048
signal back.
[tone] So now the E field is

719
00:45:06,048 --> 00:45:09,72
like so, [tone] and the antenna
receives it like so.

720
00:45:09,72 --> 00:45:13,896
[tone] Now, I have one [tone]
-- I have one brainteaser for

721
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:16,704
you, and I want you to think
about that.

722
00:45:16,704 --> 00:45:20,449
We can actually have a vote on
that.

723
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:23,837
I have here a wooden frame with
metal bars.

724
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:25,45
No trick.
Metal bars.

725
00:45:25,45 --> 00:45:28,758
And I'm going to put that in
between here.

726
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:32,63
So we have the situation that
we are transmitting

727
00:45:32,63 --> 00:45:36,987
electromagnetic waves with the E
field going like this,

728
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:39,81
and the receiver is perfectly
happy.

729
00:45:39,81 --> 00:45:42,876
The receiver is also aligned
like this.

730
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:46,748
There you have it.
I can put this grid in like so

731
00:45:46,748 --> 00:45:51,67
[wssshhht], so that the bars are
in the same

732
00:45:51,67 --> 00:45:55,999
direction as E,
but I can also put it in like

733
00:45:55,999 --> 00:46:00,231
so, so that the bars are
perpendicular to E.

734
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:05,052
If I make you a drawing,
if you would look in this

735
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:09,185
direction, then I can do one of
two things.

736
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:14,302
Either the bars are like so,
or the bars are like so,

737
00:46:14,302 --> 00:46:19,124
but in both cases,
is the electric field coming in

738
00:46:19,124 --> 00:46:22,962
like this?
Who thinks that if I have the

739
00:46:22,962 --> 00:46:26,215
bars
vertical, that the

740
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:30,903
electromagnetic radiation will
go straight through without any

741
00:46:30,903 --> 00:46:33,747
problem?
Who thinks that maybe it will

742
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:37,359
not get through?
Who thinks it will get through?

743
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,972
Who thinks it will not get
through?

744
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:42,508
Now I do this.
Who thinks that the

745
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:46,351
electromagnetic radiation,
the oscillating E-field,

746
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:50,424
can easily go through this?
Who thinks it will not get

747
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:53,037
through?
It's every evenly divided,

748
00:46:53,037 --> 00:46:57,47
we have about twenty five,
twenty five,

749
00:46:57,47 --> 00:46:59,573
twenty five,
twenty five.

750
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:02,64
OK, we'll see.
[tone] One kiloHertz.

751
00:47:02,64 --> 00:47:07,546
[tone] E field is like this,
[tone] receiver is receiving

752
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:10,35
it.
[tone] What do you want me to

753
00:47:10,35 --> 00:47:14,731
do first, this or this?
[tone] Let's do this first.

754
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,236
[tone] Nothing.
[tone] It's not absorbed.

755
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:21,128
[tone] Goes straight through
here.

756
00:47:21,128 --> 00:47:25,071
[tone] Now I rotate it.
[tone] Ninety degrees.

757
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:28,293
[tone]
And I kill it.

758
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:30,773
[tone] So in this
configuration,

759
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:35,333
[tone] the electromagnetic
radiation does not get through.

760
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:39,813
[tone] I want you to think
about it, and I -- if you have

761
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:43,493
some sleepless nights about it,
that's OK, too,

762
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:47,492
that's very healthy.
I have a second demonstration,

763
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:51,252
and that has also to do with
the polarization of

764
00:47:51,252 --> 00:47:55,252
electromagnetic radiation.
I have here seventy five

765
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:59,891
megaHertz transmitter,
so that's more like

766
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:02,763
radio stuff,
that is a four-meter

767
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:05,904
wavelength.
And this is the antenna,

768
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:10,84
this is the transmitter.
So let me give you the numbers.

769
00:48:10,84 --> 00:48:15,327
So this is seventy five
megaHertz, and that is four

770
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:19,365
meters wavelength.
And I'm going to turn it on

771
00:48:19,365 --> 00:48:22,326
like now.
You don't hear anything,

772
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:25,736
it's not connected to any
receiver yet.

773
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:30,851
Oscillating.
Making electromagnetic waves,

774
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,714
going like this,
going up.

775
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:35,323
Not much is going in this
direction.

776
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:39,048
I have a very special receiver.
A very special one.

777
00:48:39,048 --> 00:48:41,88
And that very special receiver
is this.

778
00:48:41,88 --> 00:48:45,606
It's just a straight copper
wire cut in the middle,

779
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:50,077
and the left side and the right
side I connected with a light

780
00:48:50,077 --> 00:48:52,759
bulb.
So if there is a strong current

781
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:57,379
going through here -- that means
if it receives a strong signal

782
00:48:57,379 --> 00:49:00,435
-- then the light bulb will
indicate that.

783
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:04,309
I'm going to make it dark so
that

784
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:07,106
we can, perhaps,
see that light bulb.

785
00:49:07,106 --> 00:49:11,3
So that is transmitting.
And I want to show you several

786
00:49:11,3 --> 00:49:14,173
things.
The first thing I want to show

787
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:18,057
you is that, indeed,
if I hold this parallel to the

788
00:49:18,057 --> 00:49:20,698
transmitter, that I can receive
it.

789
00:49:20,698 --> 00:49:25,591
The electric field is now going
like this, and so this receiving

790
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:29,474
antenna is very happy.
But now look a what happens,

791
00:49:29,474 --> 00:49:32,969
it's same thing I did with the
radar receiver,

792
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:38,359
I rotate it ninety degrees.
And now the E-field that comes

793
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:41,121
in this cannot cause any current
like this.

794
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:44,212
So the light bulb goes out.
I can also show you,

795
00:49:44,212 --> 00:49:47,105
which is obvious,
that if you go farther away

796
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:50,525
from the transmitter,
that the strength of the signal

797
00:49:50,525 --> 00:49:52,958
is less.
Remember, the pointing vector

798
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:56,706
goes as one over R squared.
So the light in the light bulb

799
00:49:56,706 --> 00:49:59,074
should go down by one over R
squared.

800
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:01,901
So I go a little closer --
cannot too close,

801
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:05,715
because I can really burn out
the bulb if I come too close.

802
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:09,266
But you see it's quite bright
now,

803
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:12,281
and when I walk away,
by holding it still in the

804
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:14,204
right direction,
you see, that,

805
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:16,449
indeed, the light bulb gets
fainter.

806
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:20,04
One over R square relationship.
What is also interesting,

807
00:50:20,04 --> 00:50:23,375
we can explore how much
radiation is sent out by this

808
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:26,966
transmitter in the direction of
the antenna, which is the

809
00:50:26,966 --> 00:50:30,814
direction in which we argued
that no radiation should go out.

810
00:50:30,814 --> 00:50:34,662
So let me walk over here -- or
let me walk to the other side,

811
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:37,163
because it's darker here.
So right here,

812
00:50:37,163 --> 00:50:40,498
I am now standing such that
theta

813
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:42,298
is zero.
No matter what I do,

814
00:50:42,298 --> 00:50:45,449
whether I hold my antenna like
this, or like this,

815
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:47,893
or like this,
there's nothing I can do.

816
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:51,044
I can even come a little
closer, you see no light,

817
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:54,388
because there is no energy
flowing in this direction,

818
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:57,86
no electromagnetic wave.
Largely going out in the plane

819
00:50:57,86 --> 00:51:00,626
perpendicular to the antenna,
but of course,

820
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:02,683
if I'm here,
which is not exactly

821
00:51:02,683 --> 00:51:04,548
perpendicular,
then of course,

822
00:51:04,548 --> 00:51:06,671
I do pick up also,
some radiation.

823
00:51:06,671 --> 51:12
OK, see you Friday.
