1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,229



2
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:03,517
Class average on the exam was
fifty-five.

3
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:06,805
Three homework problems were on
the exam.

4
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:10,751
I'm a little puzzled by the
fringe field problem.

5
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:14,779
That was the one homework
problem that was graded.

6
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:19,218
It was graded on your homework,
and I went back to your

7
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:22,835
homework scores and they were
ninety percent.

8
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:26,288
You all did extremely well on
that problem.

9
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:29,74
But on the exam,
it was only forty percent.

10
00:00:29,74 --> 00:00:34,368
And so perhaps this is
telling you something.

11
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,889
And maybe it's telling me
something too.

12
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:39,862
If you turn in a correct
solution for homework,

13
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:43,675
it's not very useful if you do
not understand what you wrote

14
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,162
down.
The understanding,

15
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:48,264
of course, is what matters,
not that you somehow,

16
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,978
one way or another,
get a correct solution.

17
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:54,791
If I had to judge you only on
the basis of exam one and two,

18
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,829
forgetting the quizzes,
forgetting the homework,

19
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,254
then those with eighty or lower
would fail the course,

20
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:03,71
as of now.
But of course those who have

21
00:01:03,71 --> 00:01:07,683
between
eighty and ninety are by no

22
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:11,102
means home free.
They are still in the danger

23
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:13,822
zone.
And anyone who has ninety-five

24
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:17,629
or even a hundred,
I cannot guarantee you that you

25
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,194
will pass the course.
The depends,

26
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:23,535
of course, on how you will do
in the future,

27
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:25,944
the third exam and on the
final.

28
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:29,363
Today I want to discuss with
you RC circuits.

29
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:31,85
We already discussed RL
circuits.

30
00:01:31,85 --> 00:01:36,745
Now we get RC circuits.
I have here a battery

31
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:42,469
with an EMF V zero.
And I have here a switch

32
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:48,592
connecting to a capacitor.
And here a resistor.

33
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:55,38
And I close the loop.
When I have the switch in this

34
00:01:55,38 --> 00:02:01,369
position, the capacitor is going
to charge up.

35
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:08,157
I get a current I going in this
direction.

36
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:15,496
If I call this point A here and
this point P and this point S to

37
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:20,622
make sure that we are on the
same wavelength,

38
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:25,748
I will call the potential over
the capacitor,

39
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:32,97
I will call that V A minus V P.
The potential over the resistor

40
00:02:32,97 --> 00:02:40,891
is of course always I times R,
is then V of P minus V of S.

41
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:45,292
The question now is what is the
potential over the capacitor

42
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:49,842
doing as a function of time and
what is the current doing as a

43
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:53,274
function of time as I charge up
this capacitor.

44
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:57,451
And your intuition will help
you a great deal without any

45
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:01,702
fancy differential equations.
It is clear that at T equals

46
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:04,238
zero, the capacitor is not
charged.

47
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:06,849
There is no charge on the
capacitor.

48
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,206
And it will take time to charge
the capacitor.

49
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:15,214
So at T equals zero,
you expect that the potential

50
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:19,556
over the capacitor is zero.
If you make T a little larger

51
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:23,588
than zero, you are going to
charge up this capacitor,

52
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:27,465
and so the potential over the
capacitor will go up,

53
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:30,411
and therefore the current will
go down.

54
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:35,141
And if you wait long enough --
we call that infinitely long --

55
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:38,243
then the capacitor will be fully
charged.

56
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:42,12
It will have the potential V
zero of

57
00:03:42,12 --> 00:03:46,22
the battery,
and then the current has become

58
00:03:46,22 --> 00:03:49,462
zero.
No current is flowing anymore

59
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:54,326
if the battery -- if the
capacitor is fully charged.

60
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:58,427
And so this capacitor is going
to charge up,

61
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:03,004
this becomes positive,
and this becomes negative.

62
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:08,249
And so you can construct a,
a plot whereby you plot as a

63
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:13,589
function of time here the
potential over the capacitor --

64
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:19,532
we haven't used any differential
equations yet.

65
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:26,002
You know that if you wait long
enough you will reach that value

66
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:29,968
V zero.
And it's going to build up like

67
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:33,829
this, asymptotically reach that
value.

68
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:39,255
And if C is very large,
then the current will be more

69
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:44,89
like this, and if C is very
small, then it will go much

70
00:04:44,89 --> 00:04:47,604
faster, of course,
small C.

71
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:52,613
The current as a function of
time.

72
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:56,403
In the beginning,
the current will be high,

73
00:04:56,403 --> 00:05:01,998
but ultimately the current will
die down, when the capacitor is

74
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:05,788
fully charged.
So you expect something like

75
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:08,947
this.
So this you can do without any

76
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:13,459
differential equations.
Let's now do it the correct

77
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:16,437
way.
The closed loop integral of E

78
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:20,498
dot DL happens to be zero,
which will make Mr.

79
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,503
Kirchoff very
happy.

80
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:28,288
The closed loop integral of E
dot DL in this circuit is zero.

81
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,442
Mr.
Faraday is happy and Mr.

82
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,871
Kirchoff is happy.
There is no magnetic flux

83
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:37,301
change here; we don't have
self-inductances.

84
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:42,086
The electric field inside the
capacitor is in this direction,

85
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:45,596
from plus to minus.
The electric field in the

86
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:50,381
resistor is in this direction,
the current is flowing in this

87
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:53,891
direction.
And this battery,

88
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:58,817
which has this as the positive
side and this as the negative

89
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:03,242
side, inside the battery the
electric field is in this

90
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:06,582
direction.
So if I start at point A and I

91
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:10,841
go around the circuit,
then E and DL are in the same

92
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:15,433
direction if I go from A to P,
and so I get plus V of C,

93
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:18,022
that's the E dot DL from A to
P.

94
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:24,367
Then I go through the resistor.
Again, E and DL are in the same

95
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,309
direction, so I get plus I
times R.

96
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,991
Then I come through the
battery.

97
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:34,836
Now the electric field is
opposing the direction in which

98
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:38,73
I go, so I get minus V zero.
And that is zero.

99
00:06:38,73 --> 00:06:41,671
So that's my differential
equation.

100
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:46,257
And I can write it differently,
because I know that I,

101
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:49,977
the current,
is dQ dT, Q being the charge on

102
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:55,081
the capacitor.
And it is only if that number

103
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,797
changes, if the capacitor is
either charging up or

104
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:03,55
discharging, is there a current
flowing.

105
00:07:03,55 --> 00:07:08,554
And in addition I know that V
of C is Q divided by C.

106
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:12,019
That's the definition of
capacitance.

107
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:17,6
And so I can write down for
this V of C, I can write down Q

108
00:07:17,6 --> 00:07:21,642
divided by C.
For I I can write down dQ dT.

109
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:26,165
So I get R times dQ dT minus V
zero equals zero.

110
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:31,503
And this is a differential
equation in Q.

111
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:36,179
We have seen an identical
differential equation.

112
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:38,964
It was not in Q,
it was in I,

113
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:43,938
but it had of course a
completely similar solution.

114
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:48,714
And the solution to this
differential equation is

115
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:53,688
actually quite simple.
I will put it on this board.

116
00:07:53,688 --> 00:08:00,254
Q -- so this is going to be Q
as a function of time --

117
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:06,569
is V zero C times one minus E
to the minus T over R C.

118
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,288
If I take the derivative of
this Q then I have I,

119
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:17,531
because I is dQ dT.
So I, which is dQ dT then

120
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:22,536
becomes V zero times C,
I get a minus sign,

121
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:28,375
I get another minus sign,
then I get one over R C,

122
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:34,711
and then I get E to the minus T
divided by R C.

123
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:40,212
So the two minus signs eat each
other up and I lose one C here.

124
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:45,537
And so I get that the current
as a function of time is V zero

125
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:49,974
divided by R times E to the
minus T divided by R C.

126
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:52,902
So that's the curve at the
bottom.

127
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:57,783
And the potential over the
capacitor is now very simple,

128
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:04,083
because the potential over the
capacitor is Q divided by C.

129
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:09,914
And I already have Q here,
so I simply have to divide this

130
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:13,698
C out.
So I get V zero times one minus

131
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:19,529
E to the minus T over R C.
And so that is the upper curve.

132
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:25,87
And so we can now make a small
table and we can look at various

133
00:09:25,87 --> 00:09:30,269
values for T.
Maybe I should do that here on

134
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:35,996
the blackboard,
because I don't want to erase

135
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:39,143
anything yet.
So we have T here,

136
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:44,117
we have I, and we have V of C.
And when T is zero,

137
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:48,583
you go to your equation of I,
so this is one.

138
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,744
So you have a current V zero
divided by R.

139
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:55,891
And you V C -- V C of C is
zero.

140
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:58,936
You can see that.
If T is zero,

141
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:04,214
you get one minus one -- oh
sorry, I have to go here.

142
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:10,031
You get one minus one,
so you see indeed that the

143
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:13,52
potential over the capacitance
is still zero.

144
00:10:13,52 --> 00:10:17,564
If you wait long enough,
then the current must go to

145
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:20,339
zero.
That exponential function goes

146
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,017
to zero if you wait long enough.
And your potential over the

147
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:29,696
capacitance then reaches V zero,
which is exactly consistent

148
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,867
with our solution.
If you wait a time RC,

149
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:36,594
that's called the time constant
of this circuit.

150
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:42,63
In the case of the current,
it's also called the decay time

151
00:10:42,63 --> 00:10:46,442
of the circuit.
Then of course your current is

152
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:49,492
one over E times V zero divided
by R.

153
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:53,304
And one over E is a roughly
point three seven,

154
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:57,286
oh point three seven.
So your current is down to

155
00:10:57,286 --> 00:11:01,692
thirty-seven percent of what it
was at the beginning.

156
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:05,335
And after a time R C,
the potential over the

157
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:10,503
capacitor is one minus one over
E times V zero,

158
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:16,667
and that is then about oh point
seven three -- uh,

159
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:22,957
six three, oh point six three,
sixty-three percent.

160
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:28,366
In other words,
if I go back here to my plot

161
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:35,411
and if I draw a line at time R
C, then this value here is

162
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:42,078
thirty-seven percent of the
maximum and this

163
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,713
value here is then sixty-three
percent of the maximum.

164
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:50,56
So it's in -- the solution is
rather obvious,

165
00:11:50,56 --> 00:11:54,408
very intuitive.
And the R C times can vary an

166
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:57,468
enormous amount,
as you can imagine,

167
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,704
depending upon the values for R
and C.

168
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:05,95
If we have here an R and a C
and we want to know what the R C

169
00:12:05,95 --> 00:12:11,197
time is, convince yourself that
the product of R and C indeed

170
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,254
has
units of seconds.

171
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:19,052
Remember we had L over R
before, which had also units of

172
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:22,368
seconds.
R C also has units of seconds.

173
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:26,904
If you have R equals one ohm
and C is one microfarad,

174
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:30,307
then the R C time is only a
microsecond.

175
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:34,931
But if you have R equals
hundred megaohms and you have

176
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:39,119
this one millifarad,
then this is ten to the five

177
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,172
seconds, which is longer than a
day.

178
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:46,447
And that would mean that it
would

179
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:51,901
take you even three days to
reach ninety-five percent of V

180
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:54,006
zero.
After three days,

181
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:58,885
you would still have only
ninety-five percent of the

182
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:04,338
potential difference of the
capacitor of the maximum value

183
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:08,931
that you can get.
Now what I want to do is I make

184
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:13,14
a change here.
I have here a conducting wire.

185
00:13:13,14 --> 00:13:18,115
I call this position one of the
switch.

186
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:21,149
And I'm going to put the switch
in this position,

187
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,804
position two.
And I can do that without any

188
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,079
danger.
Remember, I waited until this

189
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,682
capacitor was fully charged.
There was no current running.

190
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:33,285
And so when no current was
running, I can quietly take the

191
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,434
switch and put it in this
position.

192
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:38,973
And what is going to happen now
is of course this side is

193
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:42,07
positively charged and this is
negatively charged,

194
00:13:42,07 --> 00:13:45,673
so now you're going to get a
current which is going to run

195
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:48,138
counterclockwise,
in opposite direction.

196
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:51,615
And what is going to happen is
the

197
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:56,341
capacitor is discharging now.
And the resistor will dissipate

198
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:59,098
the energy that is in the
capacitor.

199
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:04,06
The one half C V squared energy
stored in the capacitor is going

200
00:14:04,06 --> 00:14:08,471
to be dissipated in the resistor
in terms of I squared R,

201
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:12,016
in terms of heat.
And if you wait long enough,

202
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:16,664
the current will become zero.
So it should be obvious what's

203
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:20,366
going to happen.
If I return to this curve here,

204
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:24,226
if I redefine my time equals
zero,

205
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:28,704
and if this is the moment that
I put the switch in position

206
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:32,719
two, then I expect that the
capacitor will discharge.

207
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:37,042
You get a curve like this.
And I expect that the current,

208
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,752
which now becomes negative --
it reverses direction and I call

209
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:44,995
that negative.
And so the current will come

210
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:47,929
like this.
And if you wait long enough,

211
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,79
of course, the current will
aga- again become zero.

212
00:14:51,79 --> 00:14:54,338
You have discharged the
capacitor.

213
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:58,352
So if you want the formal
solution,

214
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:01,693
you have to go back to the
differential equation.

215
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:05,172
And you take this term out,
because it's not there.

216
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:09,208
And now you have to solve this
differential equation again,

217
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,244
which is now utterly trivial.
And I would like you to solve

218
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:17,002
that differential equation.
You couldn't have an easier

219
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:19,438
one.
I will give you the solution to

220
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:23,195
I as a function of time,
and you then will come up with

221
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,701
this part.
I as a function of time is

222
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:29,946
exactly the same as this except
with a minus

223
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:34,273
sign, provided that I call this
T equals zero.

224
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:39,851
So I redefine the zero time.
And so I as a function of time

225
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:45,717
is the equation that you have
here, but now with a minus sign.

226
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:49,372
So you get an exponential
change again,

227
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:52,449
but the current has flipped
over.

228
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:57,931
I can demonstrate this to you.
I have a electronic switch,

229
00:15:57,931 --> 00:16:05,572
so I go between one and two --
every four milliseconds I throw

230
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:09,303
the switch.
And so what I have is,

231
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:14,843
as a function of time,
what we call a square wave.

232
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:19,479
So this is my battery.
And this time here,

233
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:24,002
from here to here,
is eight milliseconds.

234
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:28,525
This is time.
And so this is that value V

235
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:32,03
zero.
And the values that I have

236
00:16:32,03 --> 00:16:35,395
chosen
for R and C,

237
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:40,179
I will give them to you.
The value for V zero here is

238
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:43,675
one volt, and here of course
it's zero.

239
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:48,275
The value that I have chosen
for R is six kiloohms.

240
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:52,783
And the value I have for C I
think is oh point one

241
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:55,911
microfarad.
Yes, that's what it is.

242
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:00,419
And there's a reason why I've
chosen these values.

243
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,742
This is oh point one
microfarads.

244
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:11,246
And so the R C time is six
times ten to the minus four

245
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:14,682
seconds.
So this is point six

246
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:19,959
milliseconds,
which is substantially smaller

247
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,868
than four.
And so you can expect that the

248
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:31,126
capacitor becomes almost fully
charged in these four

249
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:36,597
milliseconds.
That's why I chose the R C time

250
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,181
substantially smaller than four
milliseconds.

251
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,766
And my setup is such that I can
show you the,

252
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:47,024
um, the input,
the driving voltage of the

253
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,305
battery.
I can show you this.

254
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:54,111
I can show you then how the
capacitor is charged and how the

255
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:58,184
capacitor is discharged with the
time constant R C.

256
00:17:58,184 --> 00:18:02,095
And also how the current goes
through the system.

257
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:04,783
So I can show you also this
curve.

258
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:09,101
And then I can change the
capacitor

259
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:14,498
so that the R C time changes.
I can also change the

260
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:18,492
resistance.
So let me change first the

261
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:23,997
lights, so that you get high
quality for your money.

262
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:29,826
You already see there the
switching voltage between one

263
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:34,468
volt and zero.
And now I'm going to show you

264
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:40,944
the voltage over the capacitor,
and I will take the other one

265
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:44,778
out.
And here you see indeed exactly

266
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:48,067
the image that we discussed.
So you see early on the

267
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:51,677
charging of the capacitor,
and it reaches effectively the

268
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:54,321
maximum value.
You know, you don't have to

269
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:57,158
wait infinitely long.
That's always -- we say

270
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:59,995
infinitely long,
but that's -- clearly if you

271
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:02,896
wait three or four,
five times R C then you're

272
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:05,41
almost there.
And then here I'm going to

273
00:19:05,41 --> 00:19:09,279
switch it back to position two,
and you see it's discharging.

274
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,722
And then it's charging up
again, and discharging.

275
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:16,555
And now I can also show you the
current.

276
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,986
You see it on the same plot as
the battery -- as the capacitor

277
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:23,892
is charging, you see the current
is high.

278
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:27,596
But by the time that the
capacitor is fully charged,

279
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:31,301
the current is zero.
But the moment that I throw the

280
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:35,005
switch to position two,
the current flips direction,

281
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:38,056
becomes negative,
and then as the capacitor

282
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:42,851
discharges and heat is
dissipated in the resistor,

283
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:46,397
ultimately the current again
will become zero.

284
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:50,338
What I can do now is to
increase my capacitance by,

285
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:52,702
for instance,
a factor of five.

286
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:57,037
But that would change my R C
time to three milliseconds.

287
00:19:57,037 --> 00:20:01,608
So now there is no way that the
battery -- not the battery,

288
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:05,864
no, there is no way that the
capacitor can become fully

289
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:09,332
charged in the four milliseconds
that it has.

290
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:13,115
And you will see that indeed if
I

291
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:16,226
make this five,
point five microfarads,

292
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:20,894
oh point five microfarads,
then you see that the capacitor

293
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:25,972
has not enough time to get fully
charged, and so here you begin

294
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:29,329
to discharge.
Notice also that the current

295
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:33,424
doesn't reach to zero,
for the same reason that the

296
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:36,29
capacitor doesn't get fully
charged.

297
00:20:36,29 --> 00:20:41,122
So it never reaches the point
that the current becomes zero.

298
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:45,872
I'm already switching here to
position two,

299
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:50,741
and the current then flips over
but never becomes zero.

300
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:54,888
All right, so let's go back to
point one value.

301
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:58,766
There it is.
This is easier than LR circuits

302
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:04,176
for the reason that we don't
have to deal with Faraday's Law.

303
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:07,602
We don't have a
non-conservative field.

304
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:12,832
And so it's easier to imagine
things, because we're dealing

305
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:18,423
with Kirchoff's Law.
So potential differences are

306
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:23,013
uniquely defined and don't
depend on the path,

307
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:28,42
whereas with Faraday's Law they
do depend on the path.

308
00:21:28,42 --> 00:21:33,113
So now I want to change to a
different subject,

309
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:37,806
which is transformers.
Transformers play a very

310
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:43,519
important role in our lives.
Transformers are key in many

311
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,314
instruments that you use at home
but

312
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:54,275
also key in getting the energy
all the way from the power

313
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:57,469
station to us,
as you will see.

314
00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:02,579
A full understanding of
transformers is not easy.

315
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:08,009
It's extremely complicated.
It's really more like an

316
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:12,48
engineering problem than a
physics problem.

317
00:22:12,48 --> 00:22:18,761
I will give you a simplified
version, in which I leave a lot

318
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:23,126
of details out,
but the basic idea will be

319
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:25,787
there.
Here I have a coil,

320
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:31,111
and I call this coil the
primary.

321
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:36,631
This coil has N1 windings and
has a self-inductance L1.

322
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:41,028
And I put here a voltmeter,
which I call V1.

323
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:46,651
It's always in that circuit.
And a current I1 is running

324
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:52,478
through the coil and returning.
And there is a teeny weeny

325
00:22:52,478 --> 00:22:57,897
little current I1 -- I put a
little I there -- running

326
00:22:57,897 --> 00:23:03,724
through this voltmeter.
Insignificantly small,

327
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:10,357
so I just call this also I1,
because this I1 is so small.

328
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:15,805
But it gives me,
it allows me to always monitor

329
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:18,766
V1.
So that's the primary.

330
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:24,925
Now we have a secondary,
which is wound in such a way

331
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:31,321
that there is a magnetic flux
coupling between the two.

332
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:37,964
This is the secondary.
It has N1 -- N2 windings.

333
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:43,651
Self-inductance is L2.
And I put here a voltmeter V2.

334
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:49,556
The current I2 is flowing here.
This is I2, here is the

335
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:53,603
consumer, this is where you are
maybe.

336
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:57,868
And I2 is flowing back through
the coil.

337
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:03,992
But here is this teeny weeny
little current I2 flowing so

338
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:09,133
that I can monitor the value of
V2.

339
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:14,001
What I can do now is I can
write down the closed loop

340
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:18,588
integral of E dot DL for this
closed circuit here.

341
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:22,802
And I have to apply,
of course, Faraday's Law,

342
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:26,827
because I now have a changing
magnetic flux.

343
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:31,04
They're always AC.
Transformers always require

344
00:24:31,04 --> 00:24:35,815
alternating current.
And so if I start here and I go

345
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:41,918
through the self-inductor,
I know there is no electric

346
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:47,001
field in the self-inductor,
so that contribution of E dot

347
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:50,36
DL is zero.
Then I arrive here at this

348
00:24:50,36 --> 00:24:55,171
current, which is opposing me.
I go in this direction,

349
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:59,983
but the E field is opposing me,
and so I get minus V1.

350
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:03,614
And that now,
according to Faraday's Law,

351
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:08,607
since I went in the direction
of the current through the

352
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:13,327
self-inductor,
equals minus L1 DI1 DT.

353
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:17,547
And I'll tel- tell you what the
simplification is that I made,

354
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:21,56
because I want to be honest
with you about where I am rigid

355
00:25:21,56 --> 00:25:24,811
and where I am not.
here is really a second term

356
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:28,339
here, which is the mutual
inductance between the two

357
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,691
coils.
And there should really be a

358
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:34,357
term here in terms of that
mutual inductance capital M

359
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:36,917
times DI2 DT.
And I leave it out here.

360
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:40,722
I leave it out because the
final result in most cases is

361
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:43,904
not affected by it.
But I want you to know that

362
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:48,411
strictly
speaking, this equation is

363
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:52,065
simplified.
I know that this is the E

364
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:56,937
induced in side one.
And now I do the same closed

365
00:25:56,937 --> 00:26:03,027
loop integral through the coil,
through the voltmeter back to

366
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,26
the coil.
I start here.

367
00:26:05,26 --> 00:26:11,35
The current I2 is in the same
direction as the direction that

368
00:26:11,35 --> 00:26:13,887
I move.
So I have plus V2.

369
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:18,962
Then I go through the
self-inductor.

370
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:24,254
There's no electric field in
the self-inductor,

371
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:30,465
because there's no electric
field in a wire that has no

372
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,226
resistance.
And that now,

373
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:38,287
since I went in the direction
of the current,

374
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:43,118
is minus L2 DI2 DT.
And again, I bury the M

375
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:47,719
contribution.
And this now equals the EMF

376
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:53,7
induced in the secondary.
But clearly this is also N1

377
00:26:53,7 --> 00:26:58,747
times D
phi B DT, with a minus sign.

378
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:03,69
This is the magnetic flux
change through one loop in the

379
00:27:03,69 --> 00:27:07,105
primary.
The surface of one loop in the

380
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:11,868
primary sees a magnetic flux
going through it which is

381
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:16,092
changing with time,
and that value D phi B DT is

382
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,418
through one loop.
But I have N1 loops,

383
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:23,552
so I have an N1 there.
And so in the secondary,

384
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:28,046
I have N2 times the same D fee
by DT

385
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:34,475
if I have perfect magnetic
coupling between the two loops,

386
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:41,131
which is not always the case.
And so now you see that I have

387
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:45,643
that V2 over V1,
if I take the magnitude,

388
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:51,396
is now simply N2 over N1.
That is an amazing result.

389
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:59,067
It tells you that you can make
V2 on the secondary side way

390
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:02,239
larger than V1.
We call that transforming up,

391
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:06,421
by making N2 larger than N1.
But you can also make it lower

392
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:10,315
-- we call that a step-down
transformer -- by making N2

393
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:13,416
smaller than N1.
When I write down capital V

394
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:17,598
here you should think of that.
It's an alternating current,

395
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:21,492
so you have cosine omega Ts in
there, or sines omega T.

396
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:25,241
You should think of this
perhaps as the maximum value

397
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,621
possible.
But of course that's not

398
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:30,618
important
in the concept.

399
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:34,733
But there are always cosine
omega Ts all over the place.

400
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:38,549
The power station puts the
electricity, so to speak,

401
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,766
on the line at three hundred
thousand volts.

402
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:44,983
We discussed that earlier,
why they do that,

403
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:49,173
that's such high voltage.
So they have a transformer from

404
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:53,587
their generator to transform the
potential up to a very high

405
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:56,43
value, to three hundred thousand
volts.

406
00:28:56,43 --> 00:29:01,667
When it arrives at Boston,
it's stepped down to twelve

407
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:04,203
kilovolts.
And so there are transformers,

408
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:06,232
which you see,
huge transformers,

409
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:09,021
which have a ratio N1 over N2
of twenty-five.

410
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:11,62
So N1 is twenty-five times
larger than N2.

411
00:29:11,62 --> 00:29:13,966
So I step it down to twelve
kilovolts.

412
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:17,009
But you don't want twelve
kilovolts at your home.

413
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:20,179
You want hundred ten,
hundred twenty volts at home.

414
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:23,982
So when you look at these power
poles outside people's homes,

415
00:29:23,982 --> 00:29:26,962
you see again transformers in
these power poles,

416
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:30,575
which bring it down from twelve
kilovolts to about hundred

417
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:36,427
twenty volts.
So there you have a ratio N1

418
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:44,215
over N2 of about one hundred.
To calculate the ratios of the

419
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:49,099
current, I1 on I2,
is way more tricky.

420
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:56,228
There are some big ifs.
And one big if is that R in the

421
00:29:56,228 --> 00:30:01,64
primary -- in the secondary
side, is much,

422
00:30:01,64 --> 00:30:08,505
much smaller than omega L.
That is one if.

423
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:12,48
The second if is that no energy
is lost in terms of eddy

424
00:30:12,48 --> 00:30:15,299
currents.
Very often these two coils are

425
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,624
coupled through an iron core,
and then you get,

426
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,672
get eddy currents in the iron
core, then you lose energy.

427
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:26,141
Also, do you not always have
ideal flux coupling.

428
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:30,334
So it is not always true that
the magnetic flux through one

429
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:34,743
coil in the primary is the same
as the one through one coil in

430
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:37,706
the secondary.
But if all of that were the

431
00:30:37,706 --> 00:30:40,536
case,
so if R is much,

432
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:45,186
much less than omega L and if
there is no energy lost in eddy

433
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:48,751
currents and if there is perfect
flux coupling,

434
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:53,091
then you can show that whatever
power is delivered on the

435
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:57,586
primary side is going to be
consumed on the secondary side.

436
00:30:57,586 --> 00:31:01,384
And if that is true,
if the power delivered on the

437
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:03,554
primary side,
which is I1 V1,

438
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:07,971
if that is the same as the
power consumed on the secondary

439
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:11,743
side,
then that must be I2 V2.

440
00:31:11,743 --> 00:31:15,764
But if this is true,
which is only under those

441
00:31:15,764 --> 00:31:21,125
conditions, and this is also
correct, then of course you will

442
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:25,592
find now that I2 divided by I1
is N1 divided by N2,

443
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:30,417
and let's put here magnitudes
again, so that we are not

444
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:33,455
worried about possible minus
signs.

445
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:39,621
And then you look at this,
you see that you can generate,

446
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:44,04
if you want to,
in the secondary an enormously

447
00:31:44,04 --> 00:31:49,245
high current by simply having a
large ratio, N1 to N2.

448
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:54,843
And I will demonstrate that
today, that indeed if you meet

449
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:59,164
those conditions that you can
indeed do that.

450
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:03,878
I2 over I1, that's fine,
V2 over V1, that's fine.

451
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:06,923
So I will do two
demonstrations.

452
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:13,895
The first thing I want to
demonstrate is that if I make --

453
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:18,979
oh, that's beautiful.
I have to erase something here

454
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:23,664
-- oh, actually,
I could work on this board here

455
00:32:23,664 --> 00:32:27,551
for a while.
I have here a demonstration

456
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:31,239
whereby you see here the primary
coil.

457
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:34,428
You see it right in front of
you.

458
00:32:34,428 --> 00:32:38,216
It has two hundred and twenty
windings.

459
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:41,306
So N1 is two hundred and
twenty.

460
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:45,791
And V1 is hundred and ten
volts, and it is AC,

461
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:50,904
has to be.
The frequency is sixty hertz.

462
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:54,41
It's just what we get out of
the plug here,

463
00:32:54,41 --> 00:32:57,165
like you get it in your
dormitory.

464
00:32:57,165 --> 00:33:01,924
That means omega is about three
hundred and seventy-seven.

465
00:33:01,924 --> 00:33:05,598
It's two pi times F.
If I give you really the

466
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:09,772
correct value for V1,
it's really the maximum value

467
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:12,611
for V1 times the cosine of omega
T.

468
00:33:12,611 --> 00:33:16,952
And this value is really
hundred ten times the square

469
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:21,627
root of two.
I've mentioned that earlier

470
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:24,231
in my lectures.
The voltmeter,

471
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:29,439
however, are cir- are designed
in such a way that they only

472
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:34,467
show you hundred and ten.
And so we call that hundred and

473
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:37,878
ten volts.
I can now make the secondary

474
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:41,919
just one winding.
I have a wire that I re- ro-

475
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,869
wrap around once.
And if indeed that equation

476
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:50,268
holds, which it will,
I expect now that V2 will be

477
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:56,699
about oh point five volts,
namely the hundred ten volts

478
00:33:56,699 --> 00:34:01,904
divided by two twenty,
which is the ratio primary over

479
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:05,243
secondary.
And then I will put four

480
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:09,663
windings around,
and then you expect about two

481
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:13,296
volts.
And you will see it there right

482
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:17,716
in front of you.
This is where you're supposed

483
00:34:17,716 --> 00:34:21,055
to see the reading.
I can't see it.

484
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:27,635
So I have to trust you when you
give me those values.

485
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:32,991
OK, so here is my primary coil,
and here is my secondary.

486
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:37,677
This is my secondary coil.
And the way I have this

487
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:41,981
demonstration is that this is
completely open.

488
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:46,381
So I only show you immediately
the value of V2.

489
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:51,068
I'll show you this value.
It has a huge value of a

490
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:57,094
resistor, several megaohms.
So for sure I don't meet

491
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:00,555
this condition.
But that condition is not

492
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:05,573
necessary for this to hold.
That condition is necessary for

493
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:08,515
this to hold,
not for this to hold.

494
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:13,014
So I have no fears that I am
going to be embarrassed.

495
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:17,254
So I'm going to put one -- this
is very long wire.

496
00:35:17,254 --> 00:35:20,888
And I'm going to put one loop
around there.

497
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:26,166
I'm now powering this solenoid.
There's an iron core in there.

498
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:30,492
Sixty hertz,
hundred and ten volts.

499
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:34,242
And there we go,
one loop around it.

500
00:35:34,242 --> 00:35:37,992
I measure oh point four eight
volts.

501
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:41,1
That's not bad.
Now I put two,

502
00:35:41,1 --> 00:35:45,385
three, four around it.
What do I see now?

503
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:51,171
I see one point nine nine six.
You may not see the six.

504
00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:55,135
Very close to two.
What I will do now,

505
00:35:55,135 --> 00:36:02,849
I will move it up a little,
and when I move it up a little,

506
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:06,1
the secondary,
the flux coupling is not ideal

507
00:36:06,1 --> 00:36:09,571
anymore, and so you expect that
V2 will go down.

508
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:13,855
Just move it up a little along
the primary, and you see the

509
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:17,179
value goes down.
Because now the flux coupling

510
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:20,356
is not ideal.
And if I bring it further out,

511
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:22,867
the flux coupling becomes
hopeless.

512
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:26,856
And when I bring it here,
the flux coupling is so poor,

513
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:30,401
but I still get oh point three
volts, by the way.

514
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:36,011
So that's the first part,
to show you that this is indeed

515
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:39,732
quite accurate.
Now I want to do a second part,

516
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:44,342
and that is more interesting.
I'm going to try to convince

517
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:48,872
you that I can get a pr-
secondary current which is huge,

518
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:51,379
maybe even one thousand
amperes.

519
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:54,777
But now I have to take special
precautions.

520
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:58,902
I have to do the experiment in
a very different way.

521
00:36:58,902 --> 00:37:03,431
And the way I'm going to do
this experiment now is with a

522
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:09,356
secondary
which is specially designed to

523
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:17,16
have an enormously low value of
resistance, because I want to

524
00:37:17,16 --> 00:37:24,444
approach this situation so that
this approximately holds.

525
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:31,858
We have a very thick copper
secondary, almost half an inch

526
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,501
thick.
It's like so.

527
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:39,665
This is copper.
And I put here a nail,

528
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:44,618
an iron nail.
And the resistance of this iron

529
00:37:44,618 --> 00:37:50,358
nail is about four times ten to
the minus four ohms.

530
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:55,874
The self-inductance of this
ring, purely geometry,

531
00:37:55,874 --> 00:38:01,502
has nothing to do with the kind
of material I have,

532
00:38:01,502 --> 00:38:06,679
is easy to estimate.
I made a calculation and I

533
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:11,073
found
about five times ten to the

534
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:15,282
minus seven henry.
So omega times L2 -- I have to

535
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:20,368
multiply this by three hundred
and seventy-seven -- becomes

536
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:24,05
about two times ten to the minus
four ohms.

537
00:38:24,05 --> 00:38:28,785
Even though R2 is not much,
much smaller than omega L2,

538
00:38:28,785 --> 00:38:32,205
they are now beginning to be
comparable.

539
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:36,238
My I1, the current that I drive
in the primary,

540
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:39,911
is going
to be twenty amperes.

541
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:44,811
I do not expect that I2 will be
two hundred and twenty times

542
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:48,381
larger than I1,
because my -- I use the same

543
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:52,035
two hundred and twenty windings
for the coil,

544
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:56,685
and this is just one winding.
So I have the same ratio N1

545
00:38:56,685 --> 00:39:00,339
over N2 that I had before in
that experiment,

546
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:04,657
when I did N2 equals one.
I don't expect that this is

547
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:09,141
going to be two hundred and
twenty times

548
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:12,338
twenty amperes,
which would be about four

549
00:39:12,338 --> 00:39:17,134
thousand four hundred amperes,
because I am really not in the

550
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:20,89
domain that R is much much
smaller than omega L.

551
00:39:20,89 --> 00:39:25,126
But I probably get five hundred
to a thousand amperes.

552
00:39:25,126 --> 00:39:29,442
And if my current I2 becomes
five hundred to a thousand

553
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:33,118
amperes, you can calculate what
I square R2 is,

554
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:36,635
because you know R2.
That's all in that nail.

555
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:42,634
And that comes out to be about
hundred to four hundred watts.

556
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:46,798
You better believe that that
that nail is going to be

557
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:50,321
red-hot, is going to glow,
and probably melt.

558
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,565
And this is the idea behind
so-called induction ovens.

559
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:58,809
This is purposely done to get a
very high temperature.

560
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:02,893
It's also done in welding to
get very high currents.

561
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:07,297
And so this second part,
the demonstration with the same

562
00:40:07,297 --> 00:40:13,463
primary, I want to make it dark
so that you can see the glowing

563
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:16,864
of that nail.
And I will also show you,

564
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:22,056
of course, first the -- so here
is the coil, and here is my

565
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:25,726
secondary.
This is that very thick copper.

566
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:31,186
And then you see the nail here.
Make sure there is no current.

567
00:40:31,186 --> 00:40:34,498
My God, I almost shoved it over
there.

568
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:38,168
[laughter].
Thank goodness that I realized

569
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:44,255
that there was current.
So the current is now not going

570
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:47,361
through the solenoid,
and so here is the,

571
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:51,4
the, the secondary now.
Put some pieces of wood under

572
00:40:51,4 --> 00:40:54,118
there so that you can see it
better.

573
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,001
And so now if I power the
primary, I can't tell you

574
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,807
exactly what the current is
through the secondary,

575
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:06,078
but it's probably somewhere in
the vicinity between five

576
00:41:06,078 --> 00:41:08,564
hundred and one thousand
amperes.

577
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:11,981
It will glow.
It may take one minute to melt.

578
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:17,697
It may not melt at all.
It may take three seconds.

579
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:22,014
Unpredictable,
because we don't know exactly

580
00:41:22,014 --> 00:41:27,635
the resistance of that nail.
So I will tell you when I do

581
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:29,743
it.
I will count down.

582
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:31,852
Three, two, one,
zero.

583
00:41:31,852 --> 00:41:35,064
It's already gone.
That was fast.

584
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:40,183
So you saw it glowing,
and you can actually see that

585
00:41:40,183 --> 00:41:44,701
the nail melted.
So you've seen an example now

586
00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:49,92
where the current is immensely
high.

587
00:41:49,92 --> 00:41:55,847
So now I want to discuss with
you another practical

588
00:41:55,847 --> 00:42:01,181
application, which has immediate
consequences,

589
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:06,16
or applications I should say,
in your cars.

590
00:42:06,16 --> 00:42:09,478
Spark plugs.
Cars have coils,

591
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:15,05
and coils are run by a car
battery, which is DC,

592
00:42:15,05 --> 00:42:20,146
it's not AC.
But you got to get high voltage

593
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:24,76
to
get a spark going in spark

594
00:42:24,76 --> 00:42:28,031
plug.
And that's done in a very

595
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:31,957
clever way.
So here is my twelve volt

596
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:35,01
battery.
There is always some

597
00:42:35,01 --> 00:42:39,481
resistance, of course,
in, in the circuit.

598
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:44,716
If you have a coil,
you always have some final --

599
00:42:44,716 --> 00:42:49,296
finite resistance.
And then here is a coil,

600
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:55,947
and here is a switch.
And this has N1 windings,

601
00:42:55,947 --> 00:43:03,096
has a certain self-inductance,
the same situation that we had

602
00:43:03,096 --> 00:43:06,552
before.
And then I have here a

603
00:43:06,552 --> 00:43:12,39
secondary, where I have N2
windings, which is way,

604
00:43:12,39 --> 00:43:16,918
way larger than N1.
I close the switch.

605
00:43:16,918 --> 00:43:24,305
A current is going to build up.
And the time constant is L over

606
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:30,143
R seconds -- we discussed that
before,

607
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:34,14
it's going to build up.
And now I'm going to do

608
00:43:34,14 --> 00:43:39,093
something extremely cruel.
I'm going to open this circuit,

609
00:43:39,093 --> 00:43:42,916
open the switch.
Imagine what is -- what I am

610
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:46,131
doing.
I'm cutting instantaneously the

611
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:49,346
current.
The current is going happily,

612
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:54,038
reaches a maximum value after
several L over R seconds,

613
00:43:54,038 --> 00:43:59,077
and now I *wssht* open it up.
So I get a huge value for DI1

614
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:02,552
DT.
I1 is now the current

615
00:44:02,552 --> 00:44:04,864
in the primary.
The current,

616
00:44:04,864 --> 00:44:10,087
of course, will die down on a
time scale L over R which is the

617
00:44:10,087 --> 00:44:14,026
new value for R.
And the new value for R is the

618
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,793
fact that I open it up.
I make the resistance

619
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:21,731
infinitely large here.
And if the resistance is

620
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:26,184
infinitely large here,
my L over R time goes to zero.

621
00:44:26,184 --> 00:44:32,519
So that makes you see indeed
why the DI1 DT becomes enormous.

622
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,061
With a twelve volt battery,
you can easily get several

623
00:44:37,061 --> 00:44:41,174
hundred volts EMF now,
because the DI1 DT will of

624
00:44:41,174 --> 00:44:45,629
course create an EMF,
an induced EMF in that circuit,

625
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:50,427
because you get a D phi DT.
You get an enormous change in

626
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:54,797
the magnetic flux here,
which is directly coupled to

627
00:44:54,797 --> 00:44:58,31
the current.
And that induced EMF could be

628
00:44:58,31 --> 00:45:03,965
several hundred volts.
But now look at the secondary.

629
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:07,909
The secondary has an N2 which
is way larger than N1.

630
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:12,008
So the induced EMF in the
secondary is very roughly N2

631
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:15,411
over N1 times the induced EMF in
the primary.

632
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:19,587
That was the ratio that we had
earlier, the V2 over V1,

633
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:23,686
remember was N2 over N1.
So now I get in the secondary

634
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:27,166
an absolutely horrendous
potential difference.

635
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:30,646
I could get up to a million
volts if I wanted.

636
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:34,59
In your cars,
that is not necessary.

637
00:45:34,59 --> 00:45:39,601
It is enough in your cars that
you get here something like ten

638
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:42,887
kilovolts.
And that will comfortably give

639
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:45,516
you a spark over your spark
plug.

640
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:50,363
And so what is happening with
your car without you realizing

641
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:55,128
it, there is a circuit that
closes and opens and closes and

642
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:59,811
opens and closes and opens,
and it's only when you open it

643
00:45:59,811 --> 00:46:04,083
that you get this pathetic high
voltage

644
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,767
here and that the spark flies
over.

645
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:11,502
And if you run your engine at
three thousand RPM and you have

646
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:15,133
a four cylinder,
that happens two hundred times

647
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:18,132
per second.
But it is the breaking that

648
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:21,052
does it.
And I can demonstrate this to

649
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:23,578
you.
We have a very special spark

650
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:26,261
plug.
Maybe it should not be called

651
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:29,024
spark plug.
It's a beautiful device.

652
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:31,865
You'll see it all the way over
there.

653
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:38,517
And we have there a situation
whereby we don't even know what

654
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:42,397
N2 over N1 is.
This is ancient work of art,

655
00:46:42,397 --> 00:46:46,831
probably built in the
nineteenth century or maybe

656
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:51,542
early twenty century.
We think that N2 over N1 is at

657
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:56,438
least several thousand,
but let's say it is ten to the

658
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,856
third.
But it could be way higher than

659
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:03,92
that, we don't know.
And we run it with a car

660
00:47:03,92 --> 00:47:07,348
battery,
just like your car,

661
00:47:07,348 --> 00:47:10,507
twelve volts.
We let the current build up in

662
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:14,915
the primary, just like we have
here, and then in a very cruel

663
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,955
way we open the primary and we
create, in the secondary,

664
00:47:18,955 --> 00:47:21,82
up to three,
four, five hundred thousand

665
00:47:21,82 --> 00:47:24,244
volts.
And then what you will see,

666
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:28,064
you will see a spark fly over
here, at three hundred,

667
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:30,488
four, five hundred thousand
volts.

668
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:34,455
You can draw a spark over a
distance of ten centimeters

669
00:47:34,455 --> 00:47:38,789
easily, because all you have to
do is get

670
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:43,105
above three million volts per
meter, which is the breakdown

671
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:46,527
electric field.
And this is what I want to show

672
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:49,132
you now.
And for that I also have to

673
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,182
make it a little dark,
because if you see,

674
00:47:52,182 --> 00:47:55,828
want to see sparks of course,
you want to keep it,

675
00:47:55,828 --> 00:47:59,771
make it a little dark.
So this is the way we are going

676
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:02,598
to do it.
Maybe you want to take a look

677
00:48:02,598 --> 00:48:05,575
at that beautiful coil first.
It's there.

678
00:48:05,575 --> 00:48:08,179
So this is the,
uh, the whole setup.

679
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:12,197
Here you see the car battery
there.

680
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:16,949
It's just twelve volts.
And here you see the,

681
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:21,377
the secondary.
This is the open end of the

682
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:26,885
secondary, those two little
balls that I have there.

683
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:32,933
And all of this is enclosed.
We cannot measure very much.

684
00:48:32,933 --> 00:48:37,577
And so now I will change the
lights for you.

685
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:44,166
OK, I'm now running a current
through the primary.

686
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:48,708
And that current is about --
oh, we don't even know what the

687
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:50,863
current is.
I can't tell you.

688
00:48:50,863 --> 00:48:55,329
All I can tell you is now I
will open up the current in the

689
00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:59,024
primary, so -- boy,
I didn't mean to kill myself,

690
00:48:59,024 --> 00:49:02,873
but I did in the process.
OK, I open up the switch,

691
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:07,185
and every time that I open it
you see there this enormous

692
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:11,342
voltage at the secondary.
This is the way that your car

693
00:49:11,342 --> 00:49:15,192
coil works, and that you get
sparks

694
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:21,881
in your spark plug.
That is an enormous potential

695
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:28,431
difference there.
We can also set this in such a

696
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:35,956
way that it opens and closes
without my having to do it

697
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:39,579
manually.
And then you see,

698
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:45,432
you get an idea of how your
spark

699
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:48,157
plug works.
But that's not the reason why I

700
00:49:48,157 --> 00:49:51,205
showed it to you.
This is such a wonderful piece

701
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:54,124
of engineering.
And a lot of research was done

702
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:58,016
in the early part of the twenty
century with instruments like

703
00:49:58,016 --> 00:50:00,222
this.
It was named after the person

704
00:50:00,222 --> 00:50:02,622
who invented this,
which is Ruhmkorff,

705
00:50:02,622 --> 00:50:05,865
and when I was a student we
always referred to this

706
00:50:05,865 --> 00:50:09,368
instrument as a Ruhmkorff.
Well, I'll let it go so when

707
00:50:09,368 --> 00:50:12,741
you walk out you can come close.
But be very careful.

708
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:16,114
You're dealing there with
several

709
00:50:16,114 --> 50:21
hundred thousand volts.
OK, have a good weekend.
