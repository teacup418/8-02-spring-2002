1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
Class average on the exam was
55.

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:09
Three homework problems were on
the exam.

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
I'm a little puzzled by the
fringe field problem.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
That was the one homework
problem that was graded.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
It was graded on your homework,
and I went back to your

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:25
homework scores and they were
90%.

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:28
You all did extremely well on
that problem.

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:32
But on the exam,
it was only 40%.

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
And so perhaps this is
telling you something.

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
And maybe it's telling me
something too.

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
If you turn in a correct
solution for homework,

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:45
it's not very useful if you do
not understand what you wrote

13
00:00:43 --> 00:00:49
down.
The understanding,

14
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
of course, is what matters,
not that you somehow,

15
00:00:48 --> 00:00:54
one way or another,
get a correct solution.

16
00:00:50 --> 00:00:56
If I had to judge you only on
the basis of exam one and two,

17
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
forgetting the quizzes,
forgetting the homework,

18
00:00:57 --> 00:01:03
then those with 80 or lower
would fail the course,

19
00:01:01 --> 00:01:07
as of now.
But of course those who have

20
00:01:03 --> 00:01:09
between
80 and 90 are by no

21
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
means home free.
They are still in the danger

22
00:01:11 --> 00:01:17
zone.
And anyone who has 95

23
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
or even 100,
I cannot guarantee you that you

24
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
will pass the course.
The depends,

25
00:01:20 --> 00:01:26
of course, on how you will do
in the future,

26
00:01:23 --> 00:01:29
the third exam and on the
final.

27
00:01:25 --> 00:01:31
Today I want to discuss with
you RC circuits.

28
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
We already discussed RL
circuits.

29
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
Now we get RC circuits.
I have here a battery

30
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
with an EMF V0.
And I have here a switch

31
00:01:42 --> 00:01:48
connecting to a capacitor.
And here a resistor.

32
00:01:48 --> 00:01:54
And I close the loop.
When I have the switch in this

33
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
position, the capacitor is going
to charge up.

34
00:02:01 --> 00:02:07
I get a current I going in this
direction.

35
00:02:08 --> 00:02:14
If I call this point A here and
this point P and this point S to

36
00:02:15 --> 00:02:21
make sure that we are on the
same wavelength,

37
00:02:20 --> 00:02:26
I will call the potential over
the capacitor,

38
00:02:25 --> 00:02:31
I will call that V A minus V P.
The potential over the resistor

39
00:02:32 --> 00:02:38
is of course always I times R,
is then V of P minus V of S.

40
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
The question now is what is the
potential over the capacitor

41
00:02:45 --> 00:02:51
doing as a function of time and
what is the current doing as a

42
00:02:49 --> 00:02:55
function of time as I charge up
this capacitor.

43
00:02:53 --> 00:02:59
And your intuition will help
you a great deal without any

44
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
fancy differential equations.
It is clear that at T equals

45
00:03:01 --> 00:03:07
0, the capacitor is not
charged.

46
00:03:04 --> 00:03:10
There is no charge on the
capacitor.

47
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
And it will take time to charge
the capacitor.

48
00:03:10 --> 00:03:16
So at T=0,
you expect that the potential

49
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
over the capacitor is 0.
If you make T a little larger

50
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
than 0, you are going to
charge up this capacitor,

51
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
and so the potential over the
capacitor will go up,

52
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
and therefore the current will
go down.

53
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
And if you wait long enough --
we call that infinitely long --

54
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
then the capacitor will be fully
charged.

55
00:03:38 --> 00:03:44
It will have the potential V0 of

56
00:03:42 --> 00:03:48
the battery,
and then the current has become

57
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
0.
No current is flowing anymore

58
00:03:49 --> 00:03:55
if the battery -- if the
capacitor is fully charged.

59
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
And so this capacitor is going
to charge up,

60
00:03:58 --> 00:04:04
this becomes positive,
and this becomes negative.

61
00:04:03 --> 00:04:09
And so you can construct a,
a plot whereby you plot as a

62
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
function of time here the
potential over the capacitor --

63
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
we haven't used any differential
equations yet.

64
00:04:19 --> 00:04:25
You know that if you wait long
enough you will reach that value

65
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
V0.
And it's going to build up like

66
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
this, asymptotically reach that
value.

67
00:04:33 --> 00:04:39
And if C is very large,
then the current will be more

68
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
like this, and if C is very
small, then it will go much

69
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
faster, of course,
small C.

70
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
The current as a function of
time.

71
00:04:52 --> 00:04:58
In the beginning,
the current will be high,

72
00:04:56 --> 00:05:02
but ultimately the current will
die down, when the capacitor is

73
00:05:01 --> 00:05:07
fully charged.
So you expect something like

74
00:05:05 --> 00:05:11
this.
So this you can do without any

75
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
differential equations.
Let's now do it the correct

76
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
way.
The closed loop integral of E

77
00:05:16 --> 00:05:22
dot dL happens to be 0,
which will make Mr.

78
00:05:20 --> 00:05:26
Kirchhoff very
happy.

79
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
The closed loop integral of E
dot dL in this circuit is 0.

80
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
Mr.
Faraday is happy and Mr.

81
00:05:30 --> 00:05:36
Kirchhoff is happy.
There is no magnetic flux

82
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
change here; we don't have
self-inductances.

83
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
The electric field inside the
capacitor is in this direction,

84
00:05:42 --> 00:05:48
from plus to minus.
The electric field in the

85
00:05:45 --> 00:05:51
resistor is in this direction,
the current is flowing in this

86
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
direction.
And this battery,

87
00:05:53 --> 00:05:59
which has this as the positive
side and this as the negative

88
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
side, inside the battery the
electric field is in this

89
00:06:03 --> 00:06:09
direction.
So if I start at point A and I

90
00:06:06 --> 00:06:12
go around the circuit,
then E and dL are in the same

91
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
direction if I go from A to P,
and so I get plus V of C,

92
00:06:15 --> 00:06:21
that's the E dot dL from A to
P.

93
00:06:18 --> 00:06:24
Then I go through the resistor.
Again, E and dL are in the same

94
00:06:24 --> 00:06:30
direction, so I get plus I
times R.

95
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
Then I come through the
battery.

96
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
Now the electric field is
opposing the direction in which

97
00:06:34 --> 00:06:40
I go, so I get minus V0.
And that is 0.

98
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
So that's my differential
equation.

99
00:06:41 --> 00:06:47
And I can write it differently,
because I know that I,

100
00:06:46 --> 00:06:52
the current,
is dQ/dT, Q being the charge on

101
00:06:49 --> 00:06:55
the capacitor.
And it is only if that number

102
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
changes, if the capacitor is
either charging up or

103
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
discharging, is there a current
flowing.

104
00:07:03 --> 00:07:09
And in addition I know that V
of C is Q divided by C.

105
00:07:08 --> 00:07:14
That's the definition of
capacitance.

106
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
And so I can write down for
this V of C, I can write down Q

107
00:07:17 --> 00:07:23
divided by C.
For I, I can write down dQ/dT.

108
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
So I get R times dQ/dT minus V0 equals 0.

109
00:07:26 --> 00:07:32
And this is a differential
equation in Q.

110
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
We have seen an identical
differential equation.

111
00:07:36 --> 00:07:42
It was not in Q,
it was in I,

112
00:07:38 --> 00:07:44
but it had of course a
completely similar solution.

113
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
And the solution to this
differential equation is

114
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
actually quite simple.
I will put it on this board.

115
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
Q -- so this is going to be Q
as a function of time --

116
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
is V0 C times one minus e
to the minus T over R C.

117
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
If I take the derivative of
this Q then I have I,

118
00:08:12 --> 00:08:18
because I is dQ/dT.
So I, which is dQ/dT then

119
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
becomes V0 times C,
I get a minus sign,

120
00:08:22 --> 00:08:28
I get another minus sign,
then I get one over R C,

121
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
and then I get e to the minus T
/ R C.

122
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40
So the two minus signs eat each
other up and I lose one C here.

123
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
And so I get that the current
as a function of time is V0

124
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
divided by R times e to the
minus T divided by R C.

125
00:08:49 --> 00:08:55
So that's the curve at the
bottom.

126
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
And the potential over the
capacitor is now very simple,

127
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
because the potential over the
capacitor is Q / C.

128
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10
And I already have Q here,
so I simply have to divide this

129
00:09:09 --> 00:09:15
C out.
So I get V0 times one minus

130
00:09:13 --> 00:09:19
e to the minus T / R C.
And so that is the upper curve.

131
00:09:19 --> 00:09:25
And so we can now make a small
table and we can look at various

132
00:09:25 --> 00:09:31
values for T.
Maybe I should do that here on

133
00:09:30 --> 00:09:36
the blackboard,
because I don't want to erase

134
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
anything yet.
So we have T here,

135
00:09:39 --> 00:09:45
we have I, and we have V of C.
And when T is 0,

136
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
you go to your equation of I,
so this is one.

137
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
So you have a current V0
divided by R.

138
00:09:52 --> 00:09:58
And your V C -- V C of C is
0.

139
00:09:55 --> 00:10:01
You can see that.
If T is 0,

140
00:09:58 --> 00:10:04
you get 1 - 1 -- oh
sorry, I have to go here.

141
00:10:04 --> 00:10:10
You get 1 - 1,
so you see indeed that the

142
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
potential over the capacitance
is still 0.

143
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
If you wait long enough,
then the current must go to

144
00:10:17 --> 00:10:23
0.
That exponential function goes

145
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
to 0 if you wait long enough.
And your potential over the

146
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
capacitance then reaches V0,
which is exactly consistent

147
00:10:29 --> 00:10:35
with our solution.
If you wait a time RC,

148
00:10:32 --> 00:10:38
that's called the time constant
of this circuit.

149
00:10:36 --> 00:10:42
In the case of the current,
it's also called the decay time

150
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
of the circuit.
Then of course your current is

151
00:10:46 --> 00:10:52
one over e times V0 / R.

152
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
And one over e is a roughly
.37,

153
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
0.37.
So your current is down to

154
00:10:57 --> 00:11:03
37 percent of what it
was at the beginning.

155
00:11:01 --> 00:11:07
And after a time R C,
the potential over the

156
00:11:05 --> 00:11:11
capacitor is one minus one over
E times V0,

157
00:11:10 --> 00:11:16
and that is then about 0.73 -- uh,

158
00:11:16 --> 00:11:22
.63, 0.63,
63 percent.

159
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
In other words,
if I go back here to my plot

160
00:11:28 --> 00:11:34
and if I draw a line at time R
C, then this value here is

161
00:11:35 --> 00:11:41
37 percent of the
maximum and this

162
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
value here is then 63
percent of the maximum.

163
00:11:46 --> 00:11:52
So it's in -- the solution is
rather obvious,

164
00:11:50 --> 00:11:56
very intuitive.
And the R C times can vary an

165
00:11:54 --> 00:12:00
enormous amount,
as you can imagine,

166
00:11:57 --> 00:12:03
depending upon the values for R
and C.

167
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
If we have here an R and a C
and we want to know what the R C

168
00:12:05 --> 00:12:11
time is, convince yourself that
the product of R and C indeed

169
00:12:11 --> 00:12:17
has
units of seconds.

170
00:12:14 --> 00:12:20
Remember we had L over R
before, which had also units of

171
00:12:19 --> 00:12:25
seconds.
R C also has units of seconds.

172
00:12:22 --> 00:12:28
If you have R equals 1 ohm
and C is 1 microfarad,

173
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
then the R C time is only a
microsecond.

174
00:12:30 --> 00:12:36
But if you have R equals
100 megaohms and you have

175
00:12:34 --> 00:12:40
this 1 millifarad,
then this is 10 to the 5

176
00:12:39 --> 00:12:45
seconds, which is longer than a
day.

177
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
And that would mean that it
would

178
00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
take you even three days to
reach 95 percent of V

179
00:12:51 --> 00:12:57
0.
After three days,

180
00:12:54 --> 00:13:00
you would still have only
95 percent of the

181
00:12:58 --> 00:13:04
potential difference of the
capacitor of the maximum value

182
00:13:04 --> 00:13:10
that you can get.
Now what I want to do is I make

183
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
a change here.
I have here a conducting wire.

184
00:13:13 --> 00:13:19
I call this position 1 of the
switch.

185
00:13:18 --> 00:13:24
And I'm going to put the switch
in this position,

186
00:13:21 --> 00:13:27
position 2.
And I can do that without any

187
00:13:23 --> 00:13:29
danger.
Remember, I waited until this

188
00:13:26 --> 00:13:32
capacitor was fully charged.
There was no current running.

189
00:13:29 --> 00:13:35
And so when no current was
running, I can quietly take the

190
00:13:33 --> 00:13:39
switch and put it in this
position.

191
00:13:35 --> 00:13:41
And what is going to happen now
is of course this side is

192
00:13:38 --> 00:13:44
positively charged and this is
negatively charged,

193
00:13:42 --> 00:13:48
so now you're going to get a
current which is going to run

194
00:13:45 --> 00:13:51
counterclockwise,
in opposite direction.

195
00:13:48 --> 00:13:54
And what is going to happen is
the

196
00:13:51 --> 00:13:57
capacitor is discharging now.
And the resistor will dissipate

197
00:13:56 --> 00:14:02
the energy that is in the
capacitor.

198
00:13:59 --> 00:14:05
The one half C V squared energy
stored in the capacitor is going

199
00:14:04 --> 00:14:10
to be dissipated in the resistor
in terms of I squared R,

200
00:14:08 --> 00:14:14
in terms of heat.
And if you wait long enough,

201
00:14:12 --> 00:14:18
the current will become 0.
So it should be obvious what's

202
00:14:16 --> 00:14:22
going to happen.
If I return to this curve here,

203
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
if I redefine my time equals
0,

204
00:14:24 --> 00:14:30
and if this is the moment that
I put the switch in position

205
00:14:28 --> 00:14:34
2, then I expect that the
capacitor will discharge.

206
00:14:32 --> 00:14:38
You get a curve like this.
And I expect that the current,

207
00:14:37 --> 00:14:43
which now becomes negative --
it reverses direction and I call

208
00:14:41 --> 00:14:47
that negative.
And so the current will come

209
00:14:44 --> 00:14:50
like this.
And if you wait long enough,

210
00:14:47 --> 00:14:53
of course, the current will
aga- again become 0.

211
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
You have discharged the
capacitor.

212
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00
So if you want the formal
solution,

213
00:14:58 --> 00:15:04
you have to go back to the
differential equation.

214
00:15:01 --> 00:15:07
And you take this term out,
because it's not there.

215
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
And now you have to solve this
differential equation again,

216
00:15:09 --> 00:15:15
which is now utterly trivial.
And I would like you to solve

217
00:15:13 --> 00:15:19
that differential equation.
You couldn't have an easier

218
00:15:17 --> 00:15:23
one.
I will give you the solution to

219
00:15:19 --> 00:15:25
I as a function of time,
and you then will come up with

220
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
this part.
I as a function of time is

221
00:15:25 --> 00:15:31
exactly the same as this except
with a minus

222
00:15:29 --> 00:15:35
sign, provided that I call this
T equals 0.

223
00:15:34 --> 00:15:40
So I redefine the 0 time.
And so I as a function of time

224
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
is the equation that you have
here, but now with a minus sign.

225
00:15:45 --> 00:15:51
So you get an exponential
change again,

226
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
but the current has flipped
over.

227
00:15:52 --> 00:15:58
I can demonstrate this to you.
I have a electronic switch,

228
00:15:57 --> 00:16:03
so I go between one and two --
every four milliseconds I throw

229
00:16:05 --> 00:16:11
the switch.
And so what I have is,

230
00:16:09 --> 00:16:15
as a function of time,
what we call a square wave.

231
00:16:14 --> 00:16:20
So this is my battery.
And this time here,

232
00:16:19 --> 00:16:25
from here to here,
is eight milliseconds.

233
00:16:24 --> 00:16:30
This is time.
And so this is that value V

234
00:16:28 --> 00:16:34
0.
And the values that I have

235
00:16:32 --> 00:16:38
chosen
for R and C,

236
00:16:35 --> 00:16:41
I will give them to you.
The value for V0 here is

237
00:16:40 --> 00:16:46
1 volt, and here of course
it's 0.

238
00:16:43 --> 00:16:49
The value that I have chosen
for R is 6 kiloohms.

239
00:16:48 --> 00:16:54
And the value I have for C I
think is 0.1

240
00:16:52 --> 00:16:58
microfarad.
Yes, that's what it is.

241
00:16:55 --> 00:17:01
And there's a reason why I've
chosen these values.

242
00:17:00 --> 00:17:06
This is 0.1
microfarads.

243
00:17:04 --> 00:17:10
And so the R C time is 6
times 10 to the -4

244
00:17:11 --> 00:17:17
seconds.
So this is 0.6

245
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
milliseconds,
which is substantially smaller

246
00:17:19 --> 00:17:25
than 4.
And so you can expect that the

247
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30
capacitor becomes almost fully
charged in these four

248
00:17:31 --> 00:17:37
milliseconds.
That's why I chose the R C time

249
00:17:36 --> 00:17:42
substantially smaller than four
milliseconds.

250
00:17:40 --> 00:17:46
And my setup is such that I can
show you the,

251
00:17:43 --> 00:17:49
um, the input,
the driving voltage of the

252
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
battery.
I can show you this.

253
00:17:49 --> 00:17:55
I can show you then how the
capacitor is charged and how the

254
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
capacitor is discharged with the
time constant R C.

255
00:17:58 --> 00:18:04
And also how the current goes
through the system.

256
00:18:02 --> 00:18:08
So I can show you also this
curve.

257
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
And then I can change the
capacitor

258
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
so that the R C time changes.
I can also change the

259
00:18:14 --> 00:18:20
resistance.
So let me change first the

260
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
lights, so that you get high
quality for your money.

261
00:18:23 --> 00:18:29
You already see there the
switching voltage between one

262
00:18:29 --> 00:18:35
volt and 0.
And now I'm going to show you

263
00:18:34 --> 00:18:40
the voltage over the capacitor,
and I will take the other one

264
00:18:40 --> 00:18:46
out.
And here you see indeed exactly

265
00:18:44 --> 00:18:50
the image that we discussed.
So you see early on the

266
00:18:48 --> 00:18:54
charging of the capacitor,
and it reaches effectively the

267
00:18:51 --> 00:18:57
maximum value.
You know, you don't have to

268
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
wait infinitely long.
That's always -- we say

269
00:18:57 --> 00:19:03
infinitely long,
but that's -- clearly if you

270
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
wait three or four,
five times R C then you're

271
00:19:02 --> 00:19:08
almost there.
And then here I'm going to

272
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
switch it back to position 2,
and you see it's discharging.

273
00:19:09 --> 00:19:15
And then it's charging up
again, and discharging.

274
00:19:13 --> 00:19:19
And now I can also show you the
current.

275
00:19:16 --> 00:19:22
You see it on the same plot as
the battery -- as the capacitor

276
00:19:20 --> 00:19:26
is charging, you see the current
is high.

277
00:19:23 --> 00:19:29
But by the time that the
capacitor is fully charged,

278
00:19:27 --> 00:19:33
the current is 0.
But the moment that I throw the

279
00:19:31 --> 00:19:37
switch to position 2,
the current flips direction,

280
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
becomes negative,
and then as the capacitor

281
00:19:38 --> 00:19:44
discharges and heat is
dissipated in the resistor,

282
00:19:42 --> 00:19:48
ultimately the current again
will become 0.

283
00:19:46 --> 00:19:52
What I can do now is to
increase my capacitance by,

284
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
for instance,
a factor of five.

285
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
But that would change my R C
time to three milliseconds.

286
00:19:57 --> 00:20:03
So now there is no way that the
battery -- not the battery,

287
00:20:01 --> 00:20:07
no, there is no way that the
capacitor can become fully

288
00:20:05 --> 00:20:11
charged in the four milliseconds
that it has.

289
00:20:09 --> 00:20:15
And you will see that indeed if
I

290
00:20:13 --> 00:20:19
make this 5,
0.5 microfarads,

291
00:20:16 --> 00:20:22
0.5 microfarads,
then you see that the capacitor

292
00:20:20 --> 00:20:26
has not enough time to get fully
charged, and so here you begin

293
00:20:25 --> 00:20:31
to discharge.
Notice also that the current

294
00:20:29 --> 00:20:35
doesn't reach to 0,
for the same reason that the

295
00:20:33 --> 00:20:39
capacitor doesn't get fully
charged.

296
00:20:36 --> 00:20:42
So it never reaches the point
that the current becomes 0.

297
00:20:41 --> 00:20:47
I'm already switching here to
position 2,

298
00:20:45 --> 00:20:51
and the current then flips over
but never becomes 0.

299
00:20:50 --> 00:20:56
All right, so let's go back to
0.1 value.

300
00:20:54 --> 00:21:00
There it is.
This is easier than LR circuits

301
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
for the reason that we don't
have to deal with Faraday's Law.

302
00:21:04 --> 00:21:10
We don't have a
non-conservative field.

303
00:21:07 --> 00:21:13
And so it's easier to imagine
things, because we're dealing

304
00:21:12 --> 00:21:18
with Kirchhoff's Law.
So potential differences are

305
00:21:18 --> 00:21:24
uniquely defined and don't
depend on the path,

306
00:21:23 --> 00:21:29
whereas with Faraday's Law they
do depend on the path.

307
00:21:28 --> 00:21:34
So now I want to change to a
different subject,

308
00:21:33 --> 00:21:39
which is transformers.
Transformers play a very

309
00:21:37 --> 00:21:43
important role in our lives.
Transformers are key in many

310
00:21:43 --> 00:21:49
instruments that you use at home
but

311
00:21:48 --> 00:21:54
also key in getting the energy
all the way from the power

312
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
station to us,
as you will see.

313
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
A full understanding of
transformers is not easy.

314
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
It's extremely complicated.
It's really more like an

315
00:22:08 --> 00:22:14
engineering problem than a
physics problem.

316
00:22:12 --> 00:22:18
I will give you a simplified
version, in which I leave a lot

317
00:22:18 --> 00:22:24
of details out,
but the basic idea will be

318
00:22:23 --> 00:22:29
there.
Here I have a coil,

319
00:22:25 --> 00:22:31
and I call this coil the
primary.

320
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
This coil has N1 windings and
has a self-inductance L1.

321
00:22:36 --> 00:22:42
And I put here a voltmeter,
which I call V1.

322
00:22:41 --> 00:22:47
It's always in that circuit.
And a current I1 is running

323
00:22:46 --> 00:22:52
through the coil and returning.
And there is a teeny weeny

324
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
little current I1 -- I put a
little I there -- running

325
00:22:57 --> 00:23:03
through this voltmeter.
Insignificantly small,

326
00:23:03 --> 00:23:09
so I just call this also I1,
because this I1 is so small.

327
00:23:10 --> 00:23:16
But it gives me,
it allows me to always monitor

328
00:23:15 --> 00:23:21
V1.
So that's the primary.

329
00:23:18 --> 00:23:24
Now we have a secondary,
which is wound in such a way

330
00:23:24 --> 00:23:30
that there is a magnetic flux
coupling between the two.

331
00:23:31 --> 00:23:37
This is the secondary.
It has N1 -- N2 windings.

332
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
Self-inductance is L2.
And I put here a voltmeter V2.

333
00:23:43 --> 00:23:49
The current I2 is flowing here.
This is I2, here is the

334
00:23:49 --> 00:23:55
consumer, this is where you are
maybe.

335
00:23:53 --> 00:23:59
And I2 is flowing back through
the coil.

336
00:23:57 --> 00:24:03
But here is this teeny weeny
little current I2 flowing so

337
00:24:03 --> 00:24:09
that I can monitor the value of
V2.

338
00:24:09 --> 00:24:15
What I can do now is I can
write down the closed loop

339
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
integral of E dot dL for this
closed circuit here.

340
00:24:18 --> 00:24:24
And I have to apply,
of course, Faraday's Law,

341
00:24:22 --> 00:24:28
because I now have a changing
magnetic flux.

342
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
They're always AC.
Transformers always require

343
00:24:31 --> 00:24:37
alternating current.
And so if I start here and I go

344
00:24:35 --> 00:24:41
through the self-inductor,
I know there is no electric

345
00:24:41 --> 00:24:47
field in the self-inductor,
so that contribution of E dot

346
00:24:47 --> 00:24:53
dL is 0.
Then I arrive here at this

347
00:24:50 --> 00:24:56
current, which is opposing me.
I go in this direction,

348
00:24:55 --> 00:25:01
but the E field is opposing me,
and so I get minus V1.

349
00:24:59 --> 00:25:05
And that now,
according to Faraday's Law,

350
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
since I went in the direction
of the current through the

351
00:25:08 --> 00:25:14
self-inductor,
equals minus L1 dI1/dT.

352
00:25:13 --> 00:25:19
And I'll tel- tell you what the
simplification is that I made,

353
00:25:17 --> 00:25:23
because I want to be honest
with you about where I am rigid

354
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
and where I am not.
here is really a second term

355
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
here, which is the mutual
inductance between the two

356
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
coils.
And there should really be a

357
00:25:30 --> 00:25:36
term here in terms of that
mutual inductance capital M

358
00:25:34 --> 00:25:40
times dI2/dT.
And I leave it out here.

359
00:25:36 --> 00:25:42
I leave it out because the
final result in most cases is

360
00:25:40 --> 00:25:46
not affected by it.
But I want you to know that

361
00:25:43 --> 00:25:49
strictly
speaking, this equation is

362
00:25:48 --> 00:25:54
simplified.
I know that this is the E

363
00:25:52 --> 00:25:58
induced in side one.
And now I do the same closed

364
00:25:56 --> 00:26:02
loop integral through the coil,
through the voltmeter back to

365
00:26:03 --> 00:26:09
the coil.
I start here.

366
00:26:05 --> 00:26:11
The current I2 is in the same
direction as the direction that

367
00:26:11 --> 00:26:17
I move.
So I have plus V2.

368
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
Then I go through the
self-inductor.

369
00:26:18 --> 00:26:24
There's no electric field in
the self-inductor,

370
00:26:24 --> 00:26:30
because there's no electric
field in a wire that has no

371
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
resistance.
And that now,

372
00:26:33 --> 00:26:39
since I went in the direction
of the current,

373
00:26:38 --> 00:26:44
is minus L2 dI2/dT.
And again, I bury the M

374
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
contribution.
And this now equals the EMF

375
00:26:47 --> 00:26:53
induced in the secondary.
But clearly this is also N1

376
00:26:53 --> 00:26:59
times d phi B/dT, with a minus sign.

377
00:26:58 --> 00:27:04
This is the magnetic flux
change through one loop in the

378
00:27:03 --> 00:27:09
primary.
The surface of one loop in the

379
00:27:07 --> 00:27:13
primary sees a magnetic flux
going through it which is

380
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
changing with time,
and that value d phi B/dT is

381
00:27:16 --> 00:27:22
through one loop.
But I have N1 loops,

382
00:27:19 --> 00:27:25
so I have an N1 there.
And so in the secondary,

383
00:27:23 --> 00:27:29
I have N2 times the same d phi by dt,

384
00:27:28 --> 00:27:34
if I have perfect magnetic
coupling between the two loops,

385
00:27:34 --> 00:27:40
which is not always the case.
And so now you see that I have

386
00:27:41 --> 00:27:47
that V2 over V1,
if I take the magnitude,

387
00:27:45 --> 00:27:51
is now simply N2 over N1.
That is an amazing result.

388
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
It tells you that you can make
V2 on the secondary side way

389
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
larger than V1.
We call that transforming up,

390
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
by making N2 larger than N1.
But you can also make it lower

391
00:28:06 --> 00:28:12
-- we call that a step-down
transformer -- by making N2

392
00:28:10 --> 00:28:16
smaller than N1.
When I write down capital V

393
00:28:13 --> 00:28:19
here you should think of that.
It's an alternating current,

394
00:28:17 --> 00:28:23
so you have cosine omega T's in
there, or sines omega T.

395
00:28:21 --> 00:28:27
You should think of this
perhaps as the maximum value

396
00:28:25 --> 00:28:31
possible.
But of course that's not

397
00:28:27 --> 00:28:33
important
in the concept.

398
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
But there are always cosine
omega Ts all over the place.

399
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
The power station puts the
electricity, so to speak,

400
00:28:38 --> 00:28:44
on the line at 300000 volts.

401
00:28:41 --> 00:28:47
We discussed that earlier,
why they do that

402
00:28:44 --> 00:28:50
at such high voltage.
So they have a transformer from

403
00:28:49 --> 00:28:55
their generator to transform the
potential up to a very high

404
00:28:53 --> 00:28:59
value, to 30
volts.

405
00:28:56 --> 00:29:02
When it arrives at Boston,
it's stepped down to 12

406
00:29:01 --> 00:29:07
kilovolts.
And so there are transformers,

407
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
which you see,
huge transformers,

408
00:29:06 --> 00:29:12
which have a ratio N1 over N2
of 25.

409
00:29:09 --> 00:29:15
So N1 is 25 times
larger than N2.

410
00:29:11 --> 00:29:17
So I step it down to 12
kilovolts.

411
00:29:13 --> 00:29:19
But you don't want 12
kilovolts at your home.

412
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
You want 110, 120 volts at home.

413
00:29:20 --> 00:29:26
So when you look at these power
poles outside people's homes,

414
00:29:23 --> 00:29:29
you see again transformers in
these power poles,

415
00:29:26 --> 00:29:32
which bring it down from 12
kilovolts to about

416
00:29:30 --> 00:29:36
volts.
So there you have a ratio N1

417
00:29:36 --> 00:29:42
over N2 of about 100.
To calculate the ratios of the

418
00:29:44 --> 00:29:50
currents I1 and I2,
is way more tricky.

419
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
There are some big ifs.
And one big if is that R in the

420
00:29:56 --> 00:30:02
primary -- in the secondary
side, is much,

421
00:30:01 --> 00:30:07
much smaller than omega L.
That is one if.

422
00:30:08 --> 00:30:14
The second if is that no energy
is lost in terms of eddy

423
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
currents.
Very often these two coils are

424
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
coupled through an iron core,
and then you get,

425
00:30:18 --> 00:30:24
get eddy currents in the iron
core, then you lose energy.

426
00:30:22 --> 00:30:28
Also, do you not always have
ideal flux coupling.

427
00:30:26 --> 00:30:32
So it is not always true that
the magnetic flux through one

428
00:30:30 --> 00:30:36
coil in the primary is the same
as the one through one coil in

429
00:30:34 --> 00:30:40
the secondary.
But if all of that were the

430
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
case,
so if R is much,

431
00:30:40 --> 00:30:46
much less than omega L and if
there is no energy lost in eddy

432
00:30:45 --> 00:30:51
currents and if there is perfect
flux coupling,

433
00:30:48 --> 00:30:54
then you can show that whatever
power is delivered on the

434
00:30:53 --> 00:30:59
primary side is going to be
consumed on the secondary side.

435
00:30:57 --> 00:31:03
And if that is true,
if the power delivered on the

436
00:31:01 --> 00:31:07
primary side,
which is I1 V1,

437
00:31:03 --> 00:31:09
if that is the same as the
power consumed on the secondary

438
00:31:07 --> 00:31:13
side,
then that must be I2 V2.

439
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
But if this is true,
which is only under those

440
00:31:15 --> 00:31:21
conditions, and this is also
correct, then of course you will

441
00:31:21 --> 00:31:27
find now that I2 divided by I1
is N1 divided by N2,

442
00:31:25 --> 00:31:31
and let's put here magnitudes
again, so that we are not

443
00:31:30 --> 00:31:36
worried about possible minus
signs.

444
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
And when you look at this,
you see that you can generate,

445
00:31:39 --> 00:31:45
if you want to,
in the secondary an enormously

446
00:31:44 --> 00:31:50
high current by simply having a
large ratio, N1 to N2.

447
00:31:49 --> 00:31:55
And I will demonstrate that
today, that indeed if you meet

448
00:31:54 --> 00:32:00
those conditions that you can
indeed do that.

449
00:31:59 --> 00:32:05
I2 over I1, that's fine,
V2 over V1, that's fine.

450
00:32:03 --> 00:32:09
So I will do two
demonstrations.

451
00:32:06 --> 00:32:12
The first thing I want to
demonstrate is that if I make --

452
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
oh, that's beautiful.
I have to erase something here

453
00:32:18 --> 00:32:24
-- oh, actually,
I could work on this board here

454
00:32:23 --> 00:32:29
for a while.
I have here a demonstration

455
00:32:27 --> 00:32:33
whereby you see here the primary
coil.

456
00:32:31 --> 00:32:37
You see it right in front of
you.

457
00:32:34 --> 00:32:40
It has
windings.

458
00:32:38 --> 00:32:44
So N1 is 220.

459
00:32:41 --> 00:32:47
And V1 is 110 volts, and it is AC,

460
00:32:45 --> 00:32:51
has to be.
The frequency is 60 hertz.

461
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
It's just what we get out of
the plug here,

462
00:32:54 --> 00:33:00
like you get it in your
dormitory.

463
00:32:57 --> 00:33:03
That means omega is about 377.

464
00:33:01 --> 00:33:07
It's 2 pi times F.
If I give you really the

465
00:33:05 --> 00:33:11
correct value for V1,
it's really the maximum value

466
00:33:09 --> 00:33:15
for V1 times the cosine of omega
T.

467
00:33:12 --> 00:33:18
And this value is really
110 times the square

468
00:33:16 --> 00:33:22
root of 2.
I've mentioned that earlier

469
00:33:21 --> 00:33:27
in my lectures.
The voltmeter,

470
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
however, are cir- are designed
in such a way that they only

471
00:33:29 --> 00:33:35
show you 110.
And so we call that 

472
00:33:34 --> 00:33:40
110 volts.
I can now make the secondary

473
00:33:37 --> 00:33:43
just one winding.
I have a wire that I re- ro-

474
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
wrap around once.
And if indeed that equation

475
00:33:45 --> 00:33:51
holds, which it will,
I expect now that V2 will be

476
00:33:50 --> 00:33:56
about 0.5 volts,
namely the 110 volts

477
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
divided by 220,
which is the ratio primary over

478
00:34:01 --> 00:34:07
secondary.
And then I will put four

479
00:34:05 --> 00:34:11
windings around,
and then you expect about 2

480
00:34:09 --> 00:34:15
volts.
And you will see it there right

481
00:34:13 --> 00:34:19
in front of you.
This is where you're supposed

482
00:34:17 --> 00:34:23
to see the reading.
I can't see it.

483
00:34:21 --> 00:34:27
So I have to trust you when you
give me those values.

484
00:34:27 --> 00:34:33
OK, so here is my primary coil,
and here is my secondary.

485
00:34:32 --> 00:34:38
This is my secondary coil.
And the way I have this

486
00:34:37 --> 00:34:43
demonstration is that this is
completely open.

487
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
So I only show you immediately
the value of V2.

488
00:34:46 --> 00:34:52
I'll show you this value.
It has a huge value of a

489
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
resistor, several megaohms.
So for sure I don't meet

490
00:34:57 --> 00:35:03
this condition.
But that condition is not

491
00:35:00 --> 00:35:06
necessary for this to hold.
That condition is necessary for

492
00:35:05 --> 00:35:11
this to hold,
not for this to hold.

493
00:35:08 --> 00:35:14
So I have no fears that I am
going to be embarrassed.

494
00:35:13 --> 00:35:19
So I'm going to put one -- this
is a very long wire.

495
00:35:17 --> 00:35:23
And I'm going to put one loop
around there.

496
00:35:20 --> 00:35:26
I'm now powering this solenoid.
There's an iron core in there.

497
00:35:26 --> 00:35:32
60 hertz,
110 volts.

498
00:35:30 --> 00:35:36
And there we go,
one loop around it.

499
00:35:34 --> 00:35:40
I measure 0.48
volts.

500
00:35:37 --> 00:35:43
That's not bad.
Now I put two,

501
00:35:41 --> 00:35:47
three, four around it.
What do I see now?

502
00:35:45 --> 00:35:51
I see 1.996.
You may not see the 6.

503
00:35:51 --> 00:35:57
Very close to 2.
What I will do now,

504
00:35:55 --> 00:36:01
I will move it up a little,
and when I move it up a little,

505
00:36:02 --> 00:36:08
the secondary,
the flux coupling is not ideal

506
00:36:06 --> 00:36:12
anymore, and so you expect that
V2 will go down.

507
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
Just move it up a little along
the primary, and you see the

508
00:36:13 --> 00:36:19
value goes down.
Because now the flux coupling

509
00:36:17 --> 00:36:23
is not ideal.
And if I bring it further out,

510
00:36:20 --> 00:36:26
the flux coupling becomes
hopeless.

511
00:36:22 --> 00:36:28
And when I bring it here,
the flux coupling is so poor,

512
00:36:26 --> 00:36:32
but I still get 0.3
volts, by the way.

513
00:36:30 --> 00:36:36
So that's the first part,
to show you that this is indeed

514
00:36:36 --> 00:36:42
quite accurate.
Now I want to do a second part,

515
00:36:39 --> 00:36:45
and that is more interesting.
I'm going to try to convince

516
00:36:44 --> 00:36:50
you that I can get a pr-
secondary current which is huge,

517
00:36:48 --> 00:36:54
maybe even 
amperes.

518
00:36:51 --> 00:36:57
But now I have to take special
precautions.

519
00:36:54 --> 00:37:00
I have to do the experiment in
a very different way.

520
00:36:58 --> 00:37:04
And the way I'm going to do
this experiment now is with a

521
00:37:03 --> 00:37:09
secondary
which is specially designed to

522
00:37:09 --> 00:37:15
have an enormously low value of
resistance, because I want to

523
00:37:17 --> 00:37:23
approach this situation so that
this approximately holds.

524
00:37:24 --> 00:37:30
We have a very thick copper
secondary, almost half an inch

525
00:37:31 --> 00:37:37
thick.
It's like so.

526
00:37:35 --> 00:37:41
This is copper.
And I put here a nail,

527
00:37:39 --> 00:37:45
an iron nail.
And the resistance of this iron

528
00:37:44 --> 00:37:50
nail is about 4 times 10 to
the -4 ohms.

529
00:37:50 --> 00:37:56
The self-inductance of this
ring, purely geometry,

530
00:37:55 --> 00:38:01
has nothing to do with the kind
of material I have,

531
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
is easy to estimate.
I made a calculation and I

532
00:38:06 --> 00:38:12
found
about 5 times 10 to the

533
00:38:11 --> 00:38:17
-7 henry.
So omega times L2 -- I have to

534
00:38:15 --> 00:38:21
multiply this by 377 -- becomes

535
00:38:20 --> 00:38:26
about 2 times 10 to the -4 ohms.

536
00:38:24 --> 00:38:30
Even though R2 is not much, much smaller than omega L2,

537
00:38:28 --> 00:38:34
they are now beginning to be
comparable.

538
00:38:32 --> 00:38:38
My I1, the current that I drive
in the primary,

539
00:38:36 --> 00:38:42
is going
to be 20 amperes.

540
00:38:39 --> 00:38:45
I do not expect that I2 will be
220 times

541
00:38:44 --> 00:38:50
larger than I1,
because my -- I use the same

542
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
220 windings
for the coil,

543
00:38:52 --> 00:38:58
and this is just one winding.
So I have the same ratio N1

544
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
over N2 that I had before in
that experiment,

545
00:39:00 --> 00:39:06
when I did N2 equals 1.
I don't expect that this is

546
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
going to be 220 times

547
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
20 amperes,
which would be about 

548
00:39:12 --> 00:39:18
4400 amperes,
because I am really not in the

549
00:39:17 --> 00:39:23
domain that R is much much
smaller than omega L.

550
00:39:20 --> 00:39:26
But I probably get 500 to 1000 amperes.

551
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
And if my current I2 becomes
500 to 

552
00:39:29 --> 00:39:35
amperes, you can calculate what
I square R2 is,

553
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
because you know R2.
That's all in that nail.

554
00:39:36 --> 00:39:42
And that comes out to be about
100 to 400 watts.

555
00:39:42 --> 00:39:48
You better believe that that
that nail is going to be

556
00:39:46 --> 00:39:52
red-hot, is going to glow,
and probably melt.

557
00:39:50 --> 00:39:56
And this is the idea behind
so-called induction ovens.

558
00:39:54 --> 00:40:00
This is purposely done to get a
very high temperature.

559
00:39:58 --> 00:40:04
It's also done in welding to
get very high currents.

560
00:40:02 --> 00:40:08
And so this second part,
the demonstration with the same

561
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
primary, I want to make it dark
so that you can see the glowing

562
00:40:13 --> 00:40:19
of that nail.
And I will also show you,

563
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
of course, first the -- so here
is the coil, and here is my

564
00:40:22 --> 00:40:28
secondary.
This is that very thick copper.

565
00:40:25 --> 00:40:31
And then you see the nail here.
Make sure there is no current.

566
00:40:31 --> 00:40:37
My God, I almost shoved it over
there.

567
00:40:34 --> 00:40:40
[laughter].
Thank goodness that I realized

568
00:40:38 --> 00:40:44
that there was current.
So the current is now not going

569
00:40:44 --> 00:40:50
through the solenoid,
and so here is the,

570
00:40:47 --> 00:40:53
the, the secondary now.
Put some pieces of wood under

571
00:40:51 --> 00:40:57
there so that you can see it
better.

572
00:40:54 --> 00:41:00
And so now if I power the
primary, I can't tell you

573
00:40:58 --> 00:41:04
exactly what the current is
through the secondary,

574
00:41:01 --> 00:41:07
but it's probably somewhere in
the vicinity between

575
00:41:06 --> 00:41:12
and 
amperes.

576
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
It will glow.
It may take one minute to melt.

577
00:41:11 --> 00:41:17
It may not melt at all.
It may take three seconds.

578
00:41:17 --> 00:41:23
Unpredictable,
because we don't know exactly

579
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
the resistance of that nail.
So I will tell you when I do

580
00:41:27 --> 00:41:33
it.
I will count down.

581
00:41:29 --> 00:41:35
Three, two, one,
zero.

582
00:41:31 --> 00:41:37
It's already gone.
That was fast.

583
00:41:35 --> 00:41:41
So you saw it glowing,
and you can actually see that

584
00:41:40 --> 00:41:46
the nail melted.
So you've seen an example now

585
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
where the current is immensely
high.

586
00:41:49 --> 00:41:55
So now I want to discuss with
you another practical

587
00:41:55 --> 00:42:01
application, which has immediate
consequences,

588
00:42:01 --> 00:42:07
or applications I should say,
in your cars.

589
00:42:06 --> 00:42:12
Spark plugs.
Cars have coils,

590
00:42:09 --> 00:42:15
and coils are run by a car
battery, which is DC,

591
00:42:15 --> 00:42:21
it's not AC.
But you got to get high voltage

592
00:42:20 --> 00:42:26
to
get a spark going in spark

593
00:42:24 --> 00:42:30
plug.
And that's done in a very

594
00:42:28 --> 00:42:34
clever way.
So here is my 12 volt

595
00:42:31 --> 00:42:37
battery.
There is always some

596
00:42:35 --> 00:42:41
resistance, of course,
in, in the circuit.

597
00:42:39 --> 00:42:45
If you have a coil,
you always have some final --

598
00:42:44 --> 00:42:50
finite resistance.
And then here is a coil,

599
00:42:49 --> 00:42:55
and here is a switch.
And this has N1 windings,

600
00:42:55 --> 00:43:01
has a certain self-inductance,
the same situation that we had

601
00:43:03 --> 00:43:09
before.
And then I have here a

602
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
secondary, where I have N2
windings, which is way,

603
00:43:12 --> 00:43:18
way larger than N1.
I close the switch.

604
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
A current is going to build up.
And the time constant is L /

605
00:43:24 --> 00:43:30
R seconds -- we discussed that
before,

606
00:43:30 --> 00:43:36
it's going to build up.
And now I'm going to do

607
00:43:34 --> 00:43:40
something extremely cruel.
I'm going to open this circuit,

608
00:43:39 --> 00:43:45
open the switch.
Imagine what is -- what I am

609
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
doing.
I'm cutting instantaneously the

610
00:43:46 --> 00:43:52
current.
The current is going happily,

611
00:43:49 --> 00:43:55
reaches a maximum value after
several L / R seconds,

612
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
and now I *wssht* open it up.
So I get a huge value for

613
00:43:59 --> 00:44:05
dI1/dT.
I1 is now the current

614
00:44:02 --> 00:44:08
in the primary.
The current,

615
00:44:04 --> 00:44:10
of course, will die down on a
time scale L / R which is the

616
00:44:10 --> 00:44:16
new value for R.
And the new value for R is the

617
00:44:14 --> 00:44:20
fact that I open it up.
I make the resistance

618
00:44:17 --> 00:44:23
infinitely large here.
And if the resistance is

619
00:44:21 --> 00:44:27
infinitely large here,
my L over R time goes to 0.

620
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
So that makes you see indeed
why dI1/dT becomes enormous.

621
00:44:32 --> 00:44:38
With a 12 volt battery,
you can easily get several

622
00:44:37 --> 00:44:43
hundred volts EMF now,
because the dI1/dT will of

623
00:44:41 --> 00:44:47
course create an EMF,
an induced EMF in that circuit,

624
00:44:45 --> 00:44:51
because you get a d phi/dT.
You get an enormous change in

625
00:44:50 --> 00:44:56
the magnetic flux here,
which is directly coupled to

626
00:44:54 --> 00:45:00
the current.
And that induced EMF could be

627
00:44:58 --> 00:45:04
several hundred volts.
But now look at the secondary.

628
00:45:03 --> 00:45:09
The secondary has an N2 which
is way larger than N1.

629
00:45:07 --> 00:45:13
So the induced EMF in the
secondary is very roughly N2

630
00:45:12 --> 00:45:18
over N1 times the induced EMF in
the primary.

631
00:45:15 --> 00:45:21
That was the ratio that we had
earlier, the V2 over V1,

632
00:45:19 --> 00:45:25
remember was N2 over N1.
So now I get in the secondary

633
00:45:23 --> 00:45:29
an absolutely horrendous
potential difference.

634
00:45:27 --> 00:45:33
I could get up to a million
volts if I wanted.

635
00:45:30 --> 00:45:36
In your cars,
that is not necessary.

636
00:45:34 --> 00:45:40
It is enough in your cars that
you get here something like 10

637
00:45:39 --> 00:45:45
kilovolts.
And that will comfortably give

638
00:45:42 --> 00:45:48
you a spark over your spark
plug.

639
00:45:45 --> 00:45:51
And so what is happening with
your car without you realizing

640
00:45:50 --> 00:45:56
it, there is a circuit that
closes and opens and closes and

641
00:45:55 --> 00:46:01
opens and closes and opens,
and it's only when you open it

642
00:45:59 --> 00:46:05
that you get this pathetic high
voltage

643
00:46:04 --> 00:46:10
here and that the spark flies
over.

644
00:46:06 --> 00:46:12
And if you run your engine at 3000 RPM and you have

645
00:46:11 --> 00:46:17
a four cylinder,
that happens 200 times

646
00:46:15 --> 00:46:21
per second.
But it is the breaking that

647
00:46:18 --> 00:46:24
does it.
And I can demonstrate this to

648
00:46:21 --> 00:46:27
you.
We have a very special spark

649
00:46:23 --> 00:46:29
plug.
Maybe it should not be called

650
00:46:26 --> 00:46:32
spark plug.
It's a beautiful device.

651
00:46:29 --> 00:46:35
You'll see it all the way over
there.

652
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
And we have there a situation
whereby we don't even know what

653
00:46:38 --> 00:46:44
N2 over N1 is.
This is ancient work of art,

654
00:46:42 --> 00:46:48
probably built in the
nineteenth century or maybe

655
00:46:46 --> 00:46:52
early twenty century.
We think that N2 over N1 is at

656
00:46:51 --> 00:46:57
least several thousand,
but let's say it is 10 to the

657
00:46:56 --> 00:47:02
third.
But it could be way higher than

658
00:46:59 --> 00:47:05
that, we don't know.
And we run it with a car

659
00:47:03 --> 00:47:09
battery,
just like your car,

660
00:47:07 --> 00:47:13
12 volts.
We let the current build up in

661
00:47:10 --> 00:47:16
the primary, just like we have
here, and then in a very cruel

662
00:47:14 --> 00:47:20
way we open the primary and we
create, in the secondary,

663
00:47:18 --> 00:47:24
up to three,
four, five hundred thousand

664
00:47:21 --> 00:47:27
volts.
And then what you will see,

665
00:47:24 --> 00:47:30
you will see a spark fly over
here, at three hundred,

666
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
four, five hundred thousand
volts.

667
00:47:30 --> 00:47:36
You can draw a spark over a
distance of 10 centimeters

668
00:47:34 --> 00:47:40
easily, because all you have to
do is get

669
00:47:38 --> 00:47:44
above three million volts per
meter, which is the breakdown

670
00:47:43 --> 00:47:49
electric field.
And this is what I want to show

671
00:47:46 --> 00:47:52
you now.
And for that I also have to

672
00:47:49 --> 00:47:55
make it a little dark,
because if you see,

673
00:47:52 --> 00:47:58
want to see sparks of course,
you want to keep it,

674
00:47:55 --> 00:48:01
make it a little dark.
So this is the way we are going

675
00:47:59 --> 00:48:05
to do it.
Maybe you want to take a look

676
00:48:02 --> 00:48:08
at that beautiful coil first.
It's there.

677
00:48:05 --> 00:48:11
So this is the,
uh, the whole setup.

678
00:48:08 --> 00:48:14
Here you see the car battery
there.

679
00:48:12 --> 00:48:18
It's just twelve volts.
And here you see the,

680
00:48:16 --> 00:48:22
the secondary.
This is the open end of the

681
00:48:21 --> 00:48:27
secondary, those two little
balls that I have there.

682
00:48:26 --> 00:48:32
And all of this is enclosed.
We cannot measure very much.

683
00:48:32 --> 00:48:38
And so now I will change the
lights for you.

684
00:48:37 --> 00:48:43
OK, I'm now running a current
through the primary.

685
00:48:44 --> 00:48:50
And that current is about --
oh, we don't even know what the

686
00:48:48 --> 00:48:54
current is.
I can't tell you.

687
00:48:50 --> 00:48:56
All I can tell you is now I
will open up the current in the

688
00:48:55 --> 00:49:01
primary, so -- boy,
I didn't mean to kill myself,

689
00:48:59 --> 00:49:05
but I did in the process.
OK, I open up the switch,

690
00:49:02 --> 00:49:08
and every time that I open it
you see there this enormous

691
00:49:07 --> 00:49:13
voltage at the secondary.
This is the way that your car

692
00:49:11 --> 00:49:17
coil works, and that you get
sparks

693
00:49:15 --> 00:49:21
in your spark plug.
That is an enormous potential

694
00:49:21 --> 00:49:27
difference there.
We can also set this in such a

695
00:49:28 --> 00:49:34
way that it opens and closes
without my having to do it

696
00:49:35 --> 00:49:41
manually.
And then you see,

697
00:49:39 --> 00:49:45
you get an idea of how your
spark

698
00:49:45 --> 00:49:51
plug works.
But that's not the reason why I

699
00:49:48 --> 00:49:54
showed it to you.
This is such a wonderful piece

700
00:49:51 --> 00:49:57
of engineering.
And a lot of research was done

701
00:49:54 --> 00:50:00
in the early part of the twenty
century with instruments like

702
00:49:58 --> 00:50:04
this.
It was named after the person

703
00:50:00 --> 00:50:06
who invented this,
which is Ruhmkorff,

704
00:50:02 --> 00:50:08
and when I was a student we
always referred to this

705
00:50:05 --> 00:50:11
instrument as a Ruhmkorff.
Well, I'll let it go so when

706
00:50:09 --> 00:50:15
you walk out you can come close.
But be very careful.

707
00:50:12 --> 00:50:18
You're dealing there with
several

708
00:50:16 --> 00:50:22
hundred thousand volts.
OK, have a good weekend.
