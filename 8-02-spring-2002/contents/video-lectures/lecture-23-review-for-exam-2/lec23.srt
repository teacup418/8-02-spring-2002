1
0:00:00 --> 00:00:06
Here are the topics the way I
see them.

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:09
They're on the web.
Look on the lecture supplements

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13
of today and you can download
them.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
I want to point out that,
uh, the discount is very

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
reasonable because these magnets
are broken, and when you break a

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:26
magnet, you end up with two
monopoles, so you get 50

7
00:00:24 --> 00:00:30
percent off.
You should know better by

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:34
looking at
the key equation there,

9
00:00:32 --> 00:00:38
that magnetic monopoles don't
exist, but that's a detail.

10
00:00:37 --> 00:00:43
I want you to appreciate that I
cannot possibly cover today

11
00:00:42 --> 00:00:48
these topics in any depth,
nor can I cover all of these

12
00:00:46 --> 00:00:52
during a 50 minute exam.
So please understand that this

13
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
review is highly incomplete,
and what is not covered today

14
00:00:56 --> 00:01:02
can and will be on the exam.
I'm interested in concepts.

15
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
I'm not interested in math.
There will be seven problems.

16
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
Five of the seven problems have
only one question.

17
00:01:11 --> 00:01:17
Two problems have two
questions.

18
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
I don't think that time, that
the length of the exam is going

19
00:01:19 --> 00:01:25
to be an issue.
This exam was taken by several

20
00:01:23 --> 00:01:29
instructors.
It took them 15 to

21
00:01:26 --> 00:01:32
18 minutes,
and that's normally my

22
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
objective.
Courtesy of Professor Belcher,

23
00:01:33 --> 00:01:39
we have old tests on the
website.

24
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
I don't have the solutions.
There's only so much I can do.

25
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
I'm very grateful to Professor
Belcher that he made these exams

26
00:01:45 --> 00:01:51
available.
If you can't do some of the

27
00:01:48 --> 00:01:54
problems, I would suggest you
see your tutors or you see your

28
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
instructor.
I will also be available all

29
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
day afternoon,
not tomorrow,

30
00:01:57 --> 00:02:03
because tomorrow afternoon I'll
be

31
00:02:01 --> 00:02:07
in 26-100 all
afternoon to work on

32
00:02:06 --> 00:02:12
demonstrations for the next
week.

33
00:02:10 --> 00:02:16
Many of these problems are
straightforward.

34
00:02:14 --> 00:02:20
You may also want to consult
your study guides.

35
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
All right.
Let's first start with

36
00:02:22 --> 00:02:28
Biot-Savart.
There are not too many problems

37
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
that one can do with
Biot-Savart.

38
00:02:30 --> 00:02:36
dB equals mu 0 divided by
4 pi

39
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
times the current dL cross R
/ R squared.

40
00:02:41 --> 00:02:47
That's the formalism.
A classic problem that you

41
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
probably have done.
We have point P here at a

42
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
distance D from a wire,
and the current through the

43
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
wire is I.
If you want to know what the

44
00:03:01 --> 00:03:07
magnetic field at P is,
you can use Biot-Savart.

45
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
It would be a stupid thing to
do, but you can do it.

46
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18
You take then a small element
dL here of the wire.

47
00:03:17 --> 00:03:23
This distance is R.
This is the unit vector R,

48
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
which you have in this
equation.

49
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
And you can calculate,
then, what the contribution to

50
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
the magnetic field right here is
-- it comes out of the

51
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
blackboard -- due to this
section dL.

52
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
This angle is theta,
and the sine of theta is D

53
00:03:39 --> 00:03:45
divided
by R.

54
00:03:42 --> 00:03:48
And then you have to do an
integral over the whole wire,

55
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
theta 0 to pi.
And then you get the magnetic

56
00:03:52 --> 00:03:58
field here.
Not very smart thing to do.

57
00:03:56 --> 00:04:02
A waste of time.
Because clearly the way to do

58
00:04:00 --> 00:04:06
this is to use Ampere's Law,
which is the one at the bottom

59
00:04:06 --> 00:04:12
there.
In which case,

60
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
you would construct a closed
loop with radius D.

61
00:04:15 --> 00:04:21
This loop is perpendicular to
the blackboard.

62
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
I'll try to make you see it
three dimensionally.

63
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
You have to attach an open
surface to that closed loop.

64
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
Any open surface will do.
Let's make the open surface

65
00:04:28 --> 00:04:34
flat.
And then we apply Ampere's Law,

66
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
which is the one at the bottom
there.

67
00:04:33 --> 00:04:39
We don't have the second
portion because there is no

68
00:04:37 --> 00:04:43
changing electric flux.
We don't deal with kappa M at

69
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
all.
So we simply have that B times

70
00:04:43 --> 00:04:49
2 pi D, that is going around
in this

71
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
circle, because I know that B
is tangentially to that circle.

72
00:04:52 --> 00:04:58
I also even know the direction
according to the right-hand

73
00:04:57 --> 00:05:03
corkscrew rule,
coming out of the blackboard

74
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
here.
So as I go around the circle,

75
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
B and the dL that you see there
at the bottom are in the same

76
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
direction.
So I get 2 pi B times D

77
00:05:11 --> 00:05:17
equals mu 0 times the current
that penetrates that surface,

78
00:05:16 --> 00:05:22
and that is I.
And so the answer is very

79
00:05:21 --> 00:05:27
simple, mu 0 I divided by 2
pi D.

80
00:05:24 --> 00:05:30
That's the way you would do
this problem,

81
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
and you would stay away from
Biot-Savart.

82
00:05:31 --> 00:05:37
There is one particular problem
whereby Ampere's Law will fail.

83
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
Of course, Ampere's Law in
general works when we have

84
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
cylindrical symmetry.
This is cylindrical symmetry.

85
00:05:45 --> 00:05:51
There is one problem where
Ampere's

86
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
Law bitterly fails and where
Biot-Savart is highly superior.

87
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
I have here a conducting loop.
It's a circle.

88
00:05:57 --> 00:06:03
And you're being asked,
it runs a certain current I,

89
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
and you're being asked,
what is the magnetic field

90
00:06:04 --> 00:06:10
right at the center?
It only works for the center.

91
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
You could not find what the
magnetic field is here.

92
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
We did that in class.
You probably also did that for

93
00:06:14 --> 00:06:20
your homework.
Biot-Savart will immediately

94
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
give you the answer.
And I will leave you with that.

95
00:06:23 --> 00:06:29
And Ampere's Law won't work.
So let's now turn to Ampere's

96
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
Law and do a few problems with
Ampere's Law.

97
00:06:34 --> 00:06:40
We need cylindrical symmetry,
with very few exceptions.

98
00:06:39 --> 00:06:45
I have a hollow cylinder here,
radius R1.

99
00:06:44 --> 00:06:50
Concentric another cylinder
with radius R2.

100
00:06:48 --> 00:06:54
These are very long cylinders.
And assume that there is a

101
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
current flowing,
I, in this direction on the

102
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
surface of the inner cylinder,
and the current I is returning

103
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
on the surface of the outer
cylinder, and the two currents

104
00:07:09 --> 00:07:15
are the same in magnitude.
And I want to know what is the

105
00:07:14 --> 00:07:20
magnetic field everywhere in
space.

106
00:07:17 --> 00:07:23
I will make a,
a drawing whereby we only see

107
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
the cross-section.
So this is R1 and this is R2.

108
00:07:27 --> 00:07:33
And let's first calculate the
magnetic field for R being

109
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
larger than R2.
It's immediately obvious that

110
00:07:34 --> 00:07:40
your closed loop that you choose
itself is going to be a circle.

111
00:07:39 --> 00:07:45
That is a must.
Radius R.

112
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47
We use a symmetry argument.
Whatever the magnetic field is

113
00:07:46 --> 00:07:52
at that distance R,
little R, it must be the same

114
00:07:49 --> 00:07:55
everywhere.
It cannot be any different here

115
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
in terms of magnitude than there
because of the symmetry

116
00:07:58 --> 00:08:04
of the problem.
We have cylindrical symmetry.

117
00:08:02 --> 00:08:08
We also know that if there is
any magnetic field,

118
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
that it is going to be
tangential, either in this

119
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
direction or in that direction.
And so we go around.

120
00:08:14 --> 00:08:20
We make the closed loop
integral, use the equation that

121
00:08:18 --> 00:08:24
we have there at the bottom,
and so you get B times 2 pi

122
00:08:22 --> 00:08:28
little R equals mu 0.
And now I have to attach an

123
00:08:27 --> 00:08:33
open
surface to this loop.

124
00:08:30 --> 00:08:36
I will use the surface in the
blackboard.

125
00:08:33 --> 00:08:39
I could use any surface,
but I might as well use a flat

126
00:08:37 --> 00:08:43
surface.
And now I have to know what is

127
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
the current going through that
surface.

128
00:08:42 --> 00:08:48
Right here, on this surface,
the current is going into the

129
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
blackboard, and right here,
on this surface,

130
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
the current is coming out of
the blackboard.

131
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
The two magnitudes are the
same, so the net current is

132
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
0.
And so the magnetic field

133
00:08:59 --> 00:09:05
outside the second cylinder is
0.

134
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10
So let's now look at the area
in between the two cylinders.

135
00:09:10 --> 00:09:16
These are hollow cylinders,
now, this is completely open

136
00:09:16 --> 00:09:22
here and this is completely
open.

137
00:09:20 --> 00:09:26
They are thin,
thin material,

138
00:09:23 --> 00:09:29
thin shells,
are both cylinders.

139
00:09:26 --> 00:09:32
Now of course the closed loop
is going to be one inside the

140
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
opening
between the two cylinders.

141
00:09:37 --> 00:09:43
And again, I pick radius R.
And here I go.

142
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
I get B times 2 pi R equals
mu 0, but now there is

143
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
current going through this
surface, and the current that is

144
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
going through is I.
Not this one,

145
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
but this one.
And so we get I.

146
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
And so now we get that B is mu
0 times I divided by 2 pi

147
00:10:07 --> 00:10:13
R.
One over R field.

148
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
The direction you will find
from the right-hand corkscrew

149
00:10:14 --> 00:10:20
rule.
That's the way I normally do

150
00:10:17 --> 00:10:23
it.
You take a corkscrew and you

151
00:10:19 --> 00:10:25
turn it clockwise,
it goes into the blackboard,

152
00:10:22 --> 00:10:28
so the magnetic field here is
in this direction.

153
00:10:26 --> 00:10:32
If you're not used to turning
corkscrews in corks,

154
00:10:30 --> 00:10:36
think about when you try to
tighten a screw with a

155
00:10:33 --> 00:10:39
screwdriver.
If you go clockwise,

156
00:10:36 --> 00:10:42
the screw goes in.
At least, that is the case with

157
00:10:41 --> 00:10:47
99.99
percent of all screws that you

158
00:10:45 --> 00:10:51
find in this country.
They have a right-handed

159
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
thread.
You could make one that has a

160
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
left-handed threa- thread,
but that's not done in general.

161
00:10:57 --> 00:11:03
So now we can go to the area R
less than R1.

162
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
So that's inside this thin
shell cylinder,

163
00:11:04 --> 00:11:10
and again, you would take a
surface, a closed loop,

164
00:11:08 --> 00:11:14
that is a circle with radius
little R,

165
00:11:12 --> 00:11:18
and this is your surface
attached, open surface attached

166
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
to that closed loop.
And you will find for the same

167
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
reason that you found here that
B is 0, because there is no

168
00:11:28 --> 00:11:34
current going through that
surface.

169
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37
And so if you now make a plot
of the magnetic field B as a

170
00:11:36 --> 00:11:42
function of R,
here is R1, here is R2,

171
00:11:40 --> 00:11:46
then it is
0 here, it's 0 there,

172
00:11:45 --> 00:11:51
it has some value here,
which is this value if you

173
00:11:51 --> 00:11:57
substitute for little R R1 and
right here it is this value,

174
00:11:57 --> 00:12:03
if you substitute for little R
R2.

175
00:12:01 --> 00:12:07
And this is a curve that is
proportional to 1/R.

176
00:12:07 --> 00:12:13
And so this is the magnetic
field, and inside,

177
00:12:12 --> 00:12:18
seen from where you were
sitting, it is clockwise.

178
00:12:17 --> 00:12:23
There is one case,
and we did that in lectures,

179
00:12:21 --> 00:12:27
whereby we wanted to calculate
the magnetic field inside a

180
00:12:25 --> 00:12:31
solenoid, where Ampere's Law
works very well,

181
00:12:28 --> 00:12:34
even though we don't have then
closed loops which are circles,

182
00:12:32 --> 00:12:38
we chose a rectangle.
I want you to revisit that.

183
00:12:36 --> 00:12:42
It's undoubtedly in your book,
and I covered it during my

184
00:12:40 --> 00:12:46
lectures.
We assumed that the magnetic

185
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
field was uniform inside the
solenoid and

186
00:12:47 --> 00:12:53
0 outside the solenoid,
which was not a bad assumption,

187
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
and that allows you then,
with Ampere's Law,

188
00:12:58 --> 00:13:04
even though you go rectangular
and not circular,

189
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
to get the magnetic field
inside a solenoid.

190
00:13:07 --> 00:13:13
Very classic.
Check your lecture notes or

191
00:13:12 --> 00:13:18
watch my lecture again,
which you can do on the web.

192
00:13:17 --> 00:13:23
So now I want to turn to
Lorentz force.

193
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
The Lorentz force,
F, is Q (E + V cross B).

194
00:13:29 --> 00:13:35
This is the charge which is
moving with velocity V in a

195
00:13:33 --> 00:13:39
magnetic field B and at the
location of that charge there

196
00:13:38 --> 00:13:44
happens to be also an electric
field E.

197
00:13:41 --> 00:13:47
Let's take a situation that I
have an electron.

198
00:13:45 --> 00:13:51
I put a minus sign there to
remind you that the charge is

199
00:13:49 --> 00:13:55
negative.
And let this be the velocity of

200
00:13:53 --> 00:13:59
that electron.
And let the magnetic field be

201
00:13:56 --> 00:14:02
uniform, perpendicular to the
blackboard in this direction,

202
00:14:02 --> 00:14:08
going into the blackboard.
There is no electric field,

203
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
so we only deal with Q times V
cross B.

204
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
V cross B -- you should be able
to do that cross product -- is

205
00:14:15 --> 00:14:21
in this direction,
but since the charge is

206
00:14:19 --> 00:14:25
negative, the force on this
charge is in this direction.

207
00:14:24 --> 00:14:30
And so the electron is going to
turn over in this direction and

208
00:14:29 --> 00:14:35
you're going to get a circle if the
magnetic field is uniform.

209
00:14:35 --> 00:14:41
And the force is right at the
center of that circle.

210
00:14:40 --> 00:14:46
A little later in time,
when the electron is here,

211
00:14:44 --> 00:14:50
going with the same speed,
the force is like so.

212
00:14:49 --> 00:14:55
The speed cannot change.
The force cannot do any work,

213
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00
cannot change the kinetic
energy, because F is always

214
00:14:58 --> 00:15:04
perpendicular to the plane
through V and B,

215
00:15:02 --> 00:15:08
because it's a cross product.
And since the force is always

216
00:15:08 --> 00:15:14
perpendicular to the velocity,
you cannot change the kinetic

217
00:15:13 --> 00:15:19
energy, because you're never
doing any work.

218
00:15:16 --> 00:15:22
The only thing that the force
is doing is make it go around.

219
00:15:21 --> 00:15:27
It changes the direction of the
velocity.

220
00:15:24 --> 00:15:30
It doesn't change the magnitude
of the velocity.

221
00:15:27 --> 00:15:33
It doesn't change the speed.
All right?

222
00:15:30 --> 00:15:36
So let this radius be little R.
Combining 8.02 with

223
00:15:35 --> 00:15:41
8.01, we now have that M V

224
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
squared over R -- M being the
mass of the electron -- is that

225
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
force.
And since V is perpendicular to

226
00:15:47 --> 00:15:53
B, the sine of the angle between
them is one, and so I simply get

227
00:15:53 --> 00:15:59
here Q V B.
This is the magnitude of the

228
00:15:56 --> 00:16:02
force.
We already know the direction.

229
00:16:00 --> 00:16:06
And so one V goes,
and so I get that the radius of

230
00:16:04 --> 00:16:10
that circle is M V / Q
B.

231
00:16:08 --> 00:16:14
This being the momentum of the
electron.

232
00:16:11 --> 00:16:17
So V is the velocity of the
electron, speed.

233
00:16:14 --> 00:16:20
Q is the charge.
B is the magnetic field.

234
00:16:17 --> 00:16:23
M is the mass of the electron.
And as long as this velocity is

235
00:16:22 --> 00:16:28
reasonably smaller than the
speed of light,

236
00:16:25 --> 00:16:31
we don't have to make a
relativistic correction here.

237
00:16:29 --> 00:16:35
If it's not much smaller than
the speed of light,

238
00:16:33 --> 00:16:39
we have to make a relativistic
correction.

239
00:16:36 --> 00:16:42
I discussed the relativistic
correction in my lectures,

240
00:16:41 --> 00:16:47
but I also mentioned that that
would not be part of exams,

241
00:16:46 --> 00:16:52
so I will not further elaborate
on that.

242
00:16:50 --> 00:16:56
So we will just assume that
this is completely

243
00:16:54 --> 00:17:00
non-relativistic.
The time for this electron to

244
00:16:58 --> 00:17:04
go around, capital T,
is 2 pi R divided by V.

245
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
But I know R,
so I get 2 pi times M V

246
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
divided by Q B.
And then I have this V,

247
00:17:10 --> 00:17:16
and I lose this V,
and that is not so intuitive,

248
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
but you see that the time is
independent of the velocity of

249
00:17:18 --> 00:17:24
the electron,
assuming that it's

250
00:17:20 --> 00:17:26
non-relativistic.
And we discussed that in the

251
00:17:23 --> 00:17:29
framework of cyclotrons,
time for these particles to go

252
00:17:27 --> 00:17:33
around is independent of the
velocity.

253
00:17:30 --> 00:17:36
Suppose I have a magnetic field
B which is 7.8

254
00:17:34 --> 00:17:40
times 10 to the -4
tesla.

255
00:17:37 --> 00:17:43
Now I know what you're
thinking.

256
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
You're thinking,
why the hell do you take this

257
00:17:44 --> 00:17:50
crazy value?
There is a reason for that,

258
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
because I have a demonstration
here.

259
00:17:50 --> 00:17:56
And the magnetic field is 7.8 times 10 to the

260
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
-4 tesla.
If that is the field,

261
00:17:57 --> 00:18:03
I can calculate how long it
takes to go around,

262
00:18:01 --> 00:18:07
because I know the mass of the
electron, I know the charge of

263
00:18:05 --> 00:18:11
the electron,
I know the magnetic field.

264
00:18:08 --> 00:18:14
So in that case,
T is about 46

265
00:18:11 --> 00:18:17
nanoseconds.
And so the number of times that

266
00:18:14 --> 00:18:20
it
goes around,

267
00:18:17 --> 00:18:23
F, which is the frequency in
hertz, is one over the period,

268
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
is about 22 megahertz.
So it goes around,

269
00:18:30 --> 00:18:36
this electron,
22 million times per

270
00:18:35 --> 00:18:41
second.
The demonstration that I will

271
00:18:39 --> 00:18:45
show you.
We have a, a glass container,

272
00:18:44 --> 00:18:50
spherical.
It's about yea big.

273
00:18:49 --> 00:18:55
You can see it there.
There is low pressure gas in

274
00:18:53 --> 00:18:59
there, so that some of the
electrons can go around in a

275
00:18:57 --> 00:19:03
circle before they ionize the
gas.

276
00:19:00 --> 00:19:06
We will accelerate the
electrons over a potential

277
00:19:04 --> 00:19:10
difference, which I can vary
from 0 to

278
00:19:08 --> 00:19:14
volts.
And so I can give them a

279
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
certain velocity.
Suppose I gave them a potential

280
00:19:15 --> 00:19:21
difference of 100 volts,
then Q times delta V,

281
00:19:19 --> 00:19:25
which is the
potential difference,

282
00:19:23 --> 00:19:29
would then be one half M V
squared, and so if I make this

283
00:19:29 --> 00:19:35
100 volts,
I can calculate what V is,

284
00:19:33 --> 00:19:39
and I've found that the
velocity of the electrons then

285
00:19:38 --> 00:19:44
is about 5.9 times
10 to the 6 meters per

286
00:19:43 --> 00:19:49
second.
So that's the velocity if I

287
00:19:46 --> 00:19:52
have a potential difference of
100 volts.

288
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
And so I can use that velocity,
substitute that in this

289
00:19:56 --> 00:20:02
equation, and then I get the
radius of these electrons in

290
00:20:00 --> 00:20:06
that magnetic field,
and that radius turns out then

291
00:20:04 --> 00:20:10
to be about 4.3
centimeters.

292
00:20:07 --> 00:20:13
And that is a little smaller
than the sphere that I have.

293
00:20:11 --> 00:20:17
How can I create a uniform
magnetic field of that

294
00:20:15 --> 00:20:21
magnitude, that's indeed
perpendicular to the orbit of

295
00:20:19 --> 00:20:25
the electrons?
We do that using Helmholtz

296
00:20:22 --> 00:20:28
coals- uh, coils.
We never discussed that in

297
00:20:25 --> 00:20:31
detail
during our lectures.

298
00:20:28 --> 00:20:34
You see here coils,
and you see here coils.

299
00:20:32 --> 00:20:38
And when you have two sets of
coils like that,

300
00:20:35 --> 00:20:41
and you have a proper distance
between them,

301
00:20:39 --> 00:20:45
you can create between them a
magnetic field which is almost

302
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
constant.
In this case,

303
00:20:45 --> 00:20:51
this is the field,
fifteen times larger than the

304
00:20:49 --> 00:20:55
Earth's magnetic field.
Perhaps some of you remember

305
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
that I linked you on the 8.02

306
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
website a few weeks ago to a
very nice program that I

307
00:21:01 --> 00:21:07
received from Professor Belcher
which allowed you to calculate

308
00:21:06 --> 00:21:12
magnetic field configurations
with current loops.

309
00:21:09 --> 00:21:15
And one of the things I asked
you on the website is,

310
00:21:12 --> 00:21:18
try to create what we call a
magnetic bottle.

311
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
This is a magnetic bottle.
It's also referred to as

312
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
Helmholtz coils,
whereby you can create between

313
00:21:22 --> 00:21:28
two coils a near-uniform
magnetic field.

314
00:21:25 --> 00:21:31
And so that's what we have
here, and I'm going to show you

315
00:21:29 --> 00:21:35
now how
beautiful these electrons go

316
00:21:33 --> 00:21:39
around in circles.
They ionize the gas inside,

317
00:21:38 --> 00:21:44
and then through de-excitation
of the ionization,

318
00:21:42 --> 00:21:48
you will see light.
Just the same idea that you see

319
00:21:46 --> 00:21:52
from Aurora.
So in that sense,

320
00:21:49 --> 00:21:55
you're seeing an artificial
Aurora inside a glass tube.

321
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
I have to make it very dark for
this, because the light is not

322
00:22:00 --> 00:22:06
very bright.
So we have to turn this off.

323
00:22:05 --> 00:22:11
And I have to turn all this
off.

324
00:22:07 --> 00:22:13
And I have to turn this off.
And some of you who are close

325
00:22:13 --> 00:22:19
can actually see the light
immediately in the,

326
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
in the sphere right here in
front of me.

327
00:22:21 --> 00:22:27
But if not, then you will see
it there on the screen.

328
00:22:25 --> 00:22:31
So this is the -- let me make
sure that I can have my -- so

329
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
this is the electron gun here.
It has a potential difference

330
00:22:37 --> 00:22:43
which I set roughly at
volts.

331
00:22:40 --> 00:22:46
And here you see these
electrons going around.

332
00:22:43 --> 00:22:49
And they go around roughly
22 million times per

333
00:22:48 --> 00:22:54
second.
And the gas pressure is low so

334
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57
that some of them make it all
the way before they ionize the

335
00:22:55 --> 00:23:01
gas.
And I can change the delta V.

336
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
I now make the speed lower by
making the potential difference

337
00:23:02 --> 00:23:08
over which I accelerate the
electrons, by making that lower.

338
00:23:08 --> 00:23:14
The radius is proportional to
the square root of that

339
00:23:13 --> 00:23:19
potential difference.
So now you see here,

340
00:23:17 --> 00:23:23
when I increase the potential
difference, the radius goes up.

341
00:23:22 --> 00:23:28
See how beautiful that circle
is?

342
00:23:25 --> 00:23:31
It's absolutely amazing.
Very, very nice demonstration.

343
00:23:30 --> 00:23:36
And then we reach the edge of
the -- we are now very close to

344
00:23:36 --> 00:23:42
the diameter of the,
of the glass sphere,

345
00:23:42 --> 00:23:48
so we can't go much further.
So now I want to discuss with

346
00:23:49 --> 00:23:55
you Faraday's Law.
Faraday's Law comes in many

347
00:23:55 --> 00:24:01
different ways.
Faraday's Law -- I will get up

348
00:24:02 --> 00:24:08
the, get the Maxwell's equations
up again.

349
00:24:07 --> 00:24:13
Faraday's Law --
Faraday's Law tells you that

350
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
the induced EMF is -d phi/dt.

351
00:24:17 --> 00:24:23
 d phi/dt is the magnetic flux
change through an open surface

352
00:24:23 --> 00:24:29
attached to a loop.
The loop could be somewhere in

353
00:24:29 --> 00:24:35
your brains or it could be a
real loop.

354
00:24:33 --> 00:24:39
You can imagine any loop in
space.

355
00:24:36 --> 00:24:42
That is always correct,
that statement.

356
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
So the EMF induced equals
-d phi/dt, -d/dt of the

357
00:24:46 --> 00:24:52
integral
of B dot dA,

358
00:24:50 --> 00:24:56
open surface.
You can think of many ways of

359
00:24:54 --> 00:25:00
changing the magnetic flux.
One way is a stationary loop

360
00:24:59 --> 00:25:05
and having a changing magnetic
field.

361
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
Another way is of having B
constant but changing the

362
00:25:07 --> 00:25:13
geometry so that the magnetic
flux is changing through the

363
00:25:13 --> 00:25:19
surface, if you rotate it around
or you move things around.

364
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
Let's look at both today.
Let's first take the stationary

365
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
loop.
I spent a major part of one

366
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
lecture on that.
Say this is a conducting wire

367
00:25:32 --> 00:25:38
and it has a resistance capital
R.

368
00:25:35 --> 00:25:41
This is net resistance of the
entire wire.

369
00:25:39 --> 00:25:45
And suppose here I have a
changing magnetic field,

370
00:25:44 --> 00:25:50
and this area right here is A.
And the magnetic field,

371
00:25:49 --> 00:25:55
let's say, is perpendicular to
the blackboard.

372
00:25:55 --> 00:26:01
And the strength of the field
is B, and so the magnetic flux

373
00:26:01 --> 00:26:07
phi of B is then simply A times
B.

374
00:26:04 --> 00:26:10
And so d phi/dt is then A times
dB/dt.

375
00:26:07 --> 00:26:13
Remember we were going to keep
the geometry constant.

376
00:26:12 --> 00:26:18
It's a s- it's a stationary
system, but we're going to

377
00:26:17 --> 00:26:23
change the magnetic field.
So this magnetic field is

378
00:26:22 --> 00:26:28
changing.
Perhaps it's coming out of the

379
00:26:27 --> 00:26:33
blackboard now,
and maybe it's increasing.

380
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
And so you induce then in this
conducting wire an EMF,

381
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
and the EMF has this magnitude.
This is the magnitude of the

382
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
induced EMF.
And so the current that is

383
00:26:46 --> 00:26:52
going to flow,
that is the induced current,

384
00:26:51 --> 00:26:57
is the induced EMF divided by
the resistance of that whole

385
00:26:56 --> 00:27:02
conducting loop.
The direction is never an

386
00:27:01 --> 00:27:07
issue, because you all can
handle Lenz's Law.

387
00:27:05 --> 00:27:11
Notice I didn't even put a
minus sign here,

388
00:27:08 --> 00:27:14
because the EMF is of course
-d phi/dt.

389
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
That's not important for me if
you put a minus sign here,

390
00:27:15 --> 00:27:21
but I put these bars there,
so get rid of minus signs.

391
00:27:19 --> 00:27:25
Because if the magnetic field
is coming out of the board and

392
00:27:24 --> 00:27:30
if it were increasing,
then Lenz's Law will run a

393
00:27:28 --> 00:27:34
current in this direction to
oppose

394
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
that increase.
And so minus signs in general

395
00:27:35 --> 00:27:41
are for the birds.
You can always reason in which

396
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
direction the current is going.
So that's a case whereby we

397
00:27:43 --> 00:27:49
have a stationary loop and
whereby the magnetic field is

398
00:27:48 --> 00:27:54
changing but not the geometry.
Now we'll have a case whereby

399
00:27:52 --> 00:27:58
the magnetic field,
say, is constant.

400
00:27:55 --> 00:28:01
So we have here a conducting
wire and we have a magnetic

401
00:28:00 --> 00:28:06
field, for instance,
coming out of the

402
00:28:04 --> 00:28:10
blackboard, uniform -- uniform
is always nice when we do

403
00:28:09 --> 00:28:15
integration to get this flux.
It's always nice to have B

404
00:28:14 --> 00:28:20
uniform.
And we have a bar here which

405
00:28:17 --> 00:28:23
has length L.
This is length L here.

406
00:28:20 --> 00:28:26
And we move the bar with
velocity V to the right.

407
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
So this is a very simple case.
V is here perpendicular to the

408
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
bar.
That makes it always easier.

409
00:28:32 --> 00:28:38
And B is perpendicular to the
plane through V and L,

410
00:28:37 --> 00:28:43
so that makes all sines of
theta that we may have,

411
00:28:43 --> 00:28:49
or cosines of theta,
all one.

412
00:28:46 --> 00:28:52
Magnetic field is constant,
and so the magnetic flux,

413
00:28:52 --> 00:28:58
phi of B, is the area times the
magnetic field.

414
00:28:57 --> 00:29:03
The angles are just wonderful,
so that is B times X times L if

415
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
this distance is X.
So the magnetic flux change in

416
00:29:09 --> 00:29:15
time,
d phi B/dt -- notice I don't

417
00:29:14 --> 00:29:20
care about minus signs.
I don't need n- minus signs.

418
00:29:19 --> 00:29:25
That d phi/dt is there for L
times B times dX/dt,

419
00:29:24 --> 00:29:30
and dX/dt is the velocity.
So the magnitude of the EMF is

420
00:29:30 --> 00:29:36
L B V.
And so the current that is

421
00:29:33 --> 00:29:39
going to flow,
the induced current,

422
00:29:36 --> 00:29:42
is that value,
L B V, divided by the

423
00:29:40 --> 00:29:46
resistance R,
and that is the resistance,

424
00:29:44 --> 00:29:50
then, that is in this entire
loop.

425
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
Whatever there is and where it
is I don't care,

426
00:29:50 --> 00:29:56
but that is the magnitude of
the current.

427
00:29:53 --> 00:29:59
The direction is again easy,
it's non-negotiable.

428
00:29:56 --> 00:30:02
If I move this bar to the
right, the magnetic flux is

429
00:30:00 --> 00:30:06
increasing.
It's pointing in this

430
00:30:02 --> 00:30:08
direction, the magnetic field,
so the current is going to flow

431
00:30:07 --> 00:30:13
in such a direction that it
opposes that change,

432
00:30:10 --> 00:30:16
and so the current will flow in
this direction.

433
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
That's the induced current,
and this is the magnitude.

434
00:30:20 --> 00:30:26
In 1996,
NASA attached a twenty

435
00:30:24 --> 00:30:30
kilometer conducting wire called
a tether to the shuttle,

436
00:30:29 --> 00:30:35
so L was twenty kilometers.
The magnetic field of the Earth

437
00:30:34 --> 00:30:40
is about half a gauss.
Even at a distance of

438
00:30:39 --> 00:30:45
miles,
that is not much different from

439
00:30:43 --> 00:30:49
here.
So that is 5 times 10 to

440
00:30:47 --> 00:30:53
the -5 tesla.
And the shuttle,

441
00:30:50 --> 00:30:56
as you should know from 8.01, like any near-Earth

442
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
satellite, they all fly with a
speed of about 8 kilometers

443
00:30:58 --> 00:31:04
per second.
If they go much faster,

444
00:31:01 --> 00:31:07
then they will leave the
gravitational field of the

445
00:31:04 --> 00:31:10
Earth.
So V is about,

446
00:31:06 --> 00:31:12
in circular orbit,
is about 8 kilometers per

447
00:31:09 --> 00:31:15
second.
So here you have it in meters

448
00:31:12 --> 00:31:18
per second.
If I calculate for this tether,

449
00:31:16 --> 00:31:22
moved around,
if I calculate L B V,

450
00:31:19 --> 00:31:25
I would get 8 kilovolts.
However, keep in mind that that

451
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
is only correct if B were
perpendicular to the plane

452
00:31:27 --> 00:31:33
through L V, and also if the
velocity of the shuttle were

453
00:31:32 --> 00:31:38
perpendicular to the direction
of the wire.

454
00:31:35 --> 00:31:41
None of that is the case.
The magnetic field where they

455
00:31:39 --> 00:31:45
were is not exactly
perpendicular to the plane

456
00:31:43 --> 00:31:49
through V and L.
And so what they observed was

457
00:31:47 --> 00:31:53
3.5 kilovolts,
about half of the maximum that

458
00:31:52 --> 00:31:58
you could achieve.
You may say,

459
00:31:55 --> 00:32:01
gee, this is strange,
because if you just drag a

460
00:31:58 --> 00:32:04
conducting wire through space,
you don't have a closed loop

461
00:32:03 --> 00:32:09
circuit, so you can't talk about
the idea of a magnetic flux,

462
00:32:07 --> 00:32:13
because you have no surface.
Well, at the altitude where the

463
00:32:12 --> 00:32:18
shuttle is flying,
there is still a teeny-weeny

464
00:32:15 --> 00:32:21
little bit of air,
very little but some,

465
00:32:18 --> 00:32:24
and that is highly ionized
because

466
00:32:22 --> 00:32:28
of the ultraviolet light from
the sun.

467
00:32:25 --> 00:32:31
We call that the ionosphere.
It's a plasma.

468
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
And so in the surrounding of
this wire, here and here,

469
00:32:33 --> 00:32:39
you have a conducting medium.
And so current can flow through

470
00:32:38 --> 00:32:44
that medium, this way or this
way, and that's exactly what

471
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
will happen.
So that you don't know

472
00:32:45 --> 00:32:51
precisely the path.
Current will flow,

473
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
so you do have closed loops.
And so it is meaningful to talk

474
00:32:54 --> 00:33:00
about magnetic flux change and
about the EMF,

475
00:32:57 --> 00:33:03
the induced EMF that is
generated as a result of that.

476
00:33:00 --> 00:33:06
The thing that NASA could not
predict very well was the

477
00:33:04 --> 00:33:10
current, because you do not
quite know what the resistance

478
00:33:07 --> 00:33:13
is of that closed loop.
You know what the resistance is

479
00:33:11 --> 00:33:17
of the cable,
but you don't know what the

480
00:33:13 --> 00:33:19
resistance is of the currents as
they flow through the

481
00:33:17 --> 00:33:23
ionosphere.
But the net result was that

482
00:33:19 --> 00:33:25
they had a current I in their
wire

483
00:33:23 --> 00:33:29
of about one ampere.
It was very tragic,

484
00:33:26 --> 00:33:32
because this current was so
high that the conducting wire

485
00:33:31 --> 00:33:37
melted, and the tether broke
off, and very early on in that

486
00:33:36 --> 00:33:42
experiment, the tether separated
from the shuttle.

487
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
But this is a marvelous example
of where you have motional EMF

488
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
in space.
I want you to think about it at

489
00:33:50 --> 00:33:56
home.
Where does the energy come

490
00:33:52 --> 00:33:58
from?
Because you're generating

491
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
current.
You could have lit a light

492
00:33:59 --> 00:34:05
bulb.
The energy must come from

493
00:34:01 --> 00:34:07
somewhere.
Think about that.

494
00:34:03 --> 00:34:09
Conceptually interesting
question.

495
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
By the way, I linked you on the
website to the tether.

496
00:34:10 --> 00:34:16
All you have to do is click on
it and you will get some more

497
00:34:15 --> 00:34:21
information on this incredible
experiment.

498
00:34:18 --> 00:34:24
All right.
Let's continue with the most

499
00:34:21 --> 00:34:27
important contribution,
Faraday to our economy.

500
00:34:26 --> 00:34:32
And that is the situation
whereby we rotate a loop,

501
00:34:31 --> 00:34:37
a current loop,
conducting loop -- could be

502
00:34:34 --> 00:34:40
rectangular, could be circular
-- and we rotate it round with

503
00:34:40 --> 00:34:46
angular frequency omega.
And for simplicity,

504
00:34:44 --> 00:34:50
let's have the magnetic field
just straight up.

505
00:34:48 --> 00:34:54
This is supposed to be three
dimensional.

506
00:34:52 --> 00:34:58
That's my idea.
And let this side be length A

507
00:34:56 --> 00:35:02
and this B.
So if you look at it from this

508
00:35:02 --> 00:35:08
direction, you will only see the
line.

509
00:35:06 --> 00:35:12
B here is rotating like this,
with angular velocity omega.

510
00:35:12 --> 00:35:18
And a little later in time
would be here.

511
00:35:16 --> 00:35:22
And so this length here is B.
And so this length is B cosine

512
00:35:22 --> 00:35:28
theta.
And let's assume -- we call

513
00:35:26 --> 00:35:32
this angle theta --
let's assume that it is here at

514
00:35:32 --> 00:35:38
T equals 0 when theta is
0.

515
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
I can choose that arbitrarily
any way I want to,

516
00:35:40 --> 00:35:46
of course.
And there could be a resistance

517
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
R in this entire loop.
And so the magnetic flux,

518
00:35:48 --> 00:35:54
phi of B, through a surface
attached to this loop is B --

519
00:35:53 --> 00:35:59
that's constant,
that's not changing -- and we

520
00:35:58 --> 00:36:04
have A times B,
but remember since it is a dot

521
00:36:04 --> 00:36:10
product between B dot dA then
you get a cosine theta in there,

522
00:36:10 --> 00:36:16
so you get A times B times
cosine theta.

523
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
So that's the flux.
But cosine theta is changing

524
00:36:20 --> 00:36:26
with time.
Theta is omega T,

525
00:36:23 --> 00:36:29
constant angular frequency
omega, so the magnetic flux is A

526
00:36:29 --> 00:36:35
B B cosine omega T.
So d phi/dT,

527
00:36:33 --> 00:36:39
Take the derivative,
I get an omega,

528
00:36:36 --> 00:36:42
I get A, I get B,
I get B, I get sine of omega T.

529
00:36:40 --> 00:36:46
If you're really interested in
that minus sign,

530
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
you get that automatically,
there's nothing I can do about

531
00:36:47 --> 00:36:53
it.
You get a minus sign there,

532
00:36:50 --> 00:36:56
but I'm not too much interested
in minus signs.

533
00:36:53 --> 00:36:59
But since I get it,
I can't shove it under the rug.

534
00:36:57 --> 00:37:03
So I put a minus sign here and
I change that into a +1.

535
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
The advantage is then that I
have immediately the induced

536
00:37:06 --> 00:37:12
EMF.
Notice that the induced EMF

537
00:37:10 --> 00:37:16
itself is linearly proportional
with omega.

538
00:37:14 --> 00:37:20
And so my induced current that
is going to run in that loop is

539
00:37:19 --> 00:37:25
the induced EMF divided by the
resistance of that loop.

540
00:37:24 --> 00:37:30
And so if the induced EMF is
proportional to omega,

541
00:37:28 --> 00:37:34
so is the induced current.
So if you go faster around,

542
00:37:33 --> 00:37:39
you get a higher current for
the same resistor.

543
00:37:38 --> 00:37:44
You built motors,
and during the prize ceremony I

544
00:37:42 --> 00:37:48
told you that the faster your
motor rotates,

545
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
the larger an induced EMF is
which is generated in the loop.

546
00:37:50 --> 00:37:56
You had a magnetic field which
let's assume is more or less

547
00:37:54 --> 00:38:00
constant.
Of course, it wasn't in your

548
00:37:57 --> 00:38:03
case, but let's assume for the
sake of argument.

549
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
And as your motor was going to
rotate, there was an induced

550
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
current generated by Mr.
Faraday, which is proportional

551
00:38:10 --> 00:38:16
to omega, so the current is
larger when your motor goes

552
00:38:14 --> 00:38:20
faster.
And that induced current

553
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
opposes the current which was
produced by your battery.

554
00:38:20 --> 00:38:26
And perhaps you remember that I
did a demonstration with the

555
00:38:24 --> 00:38:30
winning motor.
I blocked the rotor and I

556
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
showed you that the current
through the rotor when it was

557
00:38:30 --> 00:38:36
blocked, when omega was 0,
was 1.6 amperes.

558
00:38:34 --> 00:38:40
Simply Ohm's Law.
Battery, voltage V,

559
00:38:37 --> 00:38:43
resistance R,
the current is V divided by R.

560
00:38:41 --> 00:38:47
Then we ran the motor,
and the current went down

561
00:38:45 --> 00:38:51
enormously, by a factor of
40.

562
00:38:47 --> 00:38:53
It was only 40 milliamperes,
the time-averaged current,

563
00:38:52 --> 00:38:58
when the motor was running.
The reason is what you see

564
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
here.
You get an induced EMF,

565
00:38:58 --> 00:39:04
an induced current,
which opposes the current from

566
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
the battery.
L R circuits.

567
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
I prefer to stay on this center
board, although I could go

568
00:39:08 --> 00:39:14
there, but I don't think we need
these

569
00:39:13 --> 00:39:19
anymore.
Can I cover this?

570
00:39:15 --> 00:39:21
Most of you are happy with
that.

571
00:39:18 --> 00:39:24
I could work there,
but I prefer to stay at the

572
00:39:22 --> 00:39:28
center.
L R circuits.

573
00:39:24 --> 00:39:30
With L R circuits,
we have the embarrassment --

574
00:39:29 --> 00:39:35
not for us but for some others
-- that almost all textbooks,

575
00:39:34 --> 00:39:40
college physics,
do not understand Faraday's

576
00:39:38 --> 00:39:44
Law, and therefore they treat
the subject incorrectly.

577
00:39:44 --> 00:39:50
Embarrassing,
but of course since they know

578
00:39:49 --> 00:39:55
the answer, their answers are
correct.

579
00:39:52 --> 00:39:58
But their physics is totally
wrong.

580
00:39:56 --> 00:40:02
I will address a problem which
I found on, on the website when

581
00:40:01 --> 00:40:07
I looked at Professor Belcher's
exams.

582
00:40:05 --> 00:40:11
He has one very nice problem of
an L R circuit.

583
00:40:09 --> 00:40:15
And I will go through that with
you.

584
00:40:12 --> 00:40:18
We have an AC power supply,
V equals V0 cosine omega T.

585
00:40:17 --> 00:40:23
The frequency is 60 hertz.
It just comes out of the wall.

586
00:40:25 --> 00:40:31
And so omega,
which is 2 pi F,

587
00:40:29 --> 00:40:35
is about 377 radians per

588
00:40:34 --> 00:40:40
second.
And V0 in this case,

589
00:40:37 --> 00:40:43
100 volts.
And we have here a

590
00:40:41 --> 00:40:47
self-inductor,
and here we have a light bulb.

591
00:40:46 --> 00:40:52
And the light bulb has a
resistance which is

592
00:40:52 --> 00:40:58
ohms.
And this self-inductor is

593
00:40:55 --> 00:41:01
variable.
We don't know yet how you make

594
00:41:01 --> 00:41:07
a variable self-inductor,
but we will learn that very

595
00:41:06 --> 00:41:12
shortly, either Friday or next
week, I forgot.

596
00:41:11 --> 00:41:17
This self-inductance can be
increased over a certain range.

597
00:41:17 --> 00:41:23
And the first question that
Professor Belcher is asking is,

598
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
what is the energy dissipation
in this light bulb?

599
00:41:27 --> 00:41:33
The closed loop integral of E
dot dL is not 0,

600
00:41:33 --> 00:41:39
because Kirchhoff's loop rule
does not apply here.

601
00:41:38 --> 00:41:44
There is a self-inductor.
If you attach an open surface

602
00:41:43 --> 00:41:49
to this closed loop,
there is a magnetic flux going

603
00:41:47 --> 00:41:53
through there,
so you must deal with the third

604
00:41:52 --> 00:41:58
equation there.
You must deal with Faraday's

605
00:41:56 --> 00:42:02
Law, no matter what your
textbooks tell you.

606
00:42:00 --> 00:42:06
Kirchhoff's loop rule does not
hold.

607
00:42:03 --> 00:42:09
And if you do that correctly,
you end up with the right

608
00:42:09 --> 00:42:15
differential equation,
which happens to be the same

609
00:42:13 --> 00:42:19
one that those people find who
do not understand the physics,

610
00:42:18 --> 00:42:24
but they get the same equation.
They massage things in such a

611
00:42:23 --> 00:42:29
way that they get the same
answer.

612
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
And the I- answer then is that
the current that is going to

613
00:42:30 --> 00:42:36
flow as a result of this
voltage, variable voltage,

614
00:42:35 --> 00:42:41
that current I is a maximum
value times the cosine omega T

615
00:42:39 --> 00:42:45
minus phi.
That the maximum current itself

616
00:42:45 --> 00:42:51
is V0 divided by the s-
square root of R squared +

617
00:42:52 --> 00:42:58
omega L squared.
And that the tangent of phi is

618
00:42:58 --> 00:43:04
omega L divided by R.
I spent quite some time on this

619
00:43:05 --> 00:43:11
during one of my lectures.
And so the maximum current that

620
00:43:12 --> 00:43:18
will
flow depends on omega and

621
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
depends on L,
on the self-inductor -- of

622
00:43:20 --> 00:43:26
course on the resistor as
well.

623
00:43:23 --> 00:43:29
In Professor Belcher's problem,
he starts off with L equals

624
00:43:29 --> 00:43:35
0, and he asks you what is
the power dissipated in this

625
00:43:34 --> 00:43:40
light bulb.
If L equals 0,

626
00:43:37 --> 00:43:43
this term is not there,
and so you simply have Ohm's

627
00:43:41 --> 00:43:47
Law, I equals V0 divided by
R.

628
00:43:45 --> 00:43:51
So I max is 100/100, is 1 ampere.

629
00:43:51 --> 00:43:57
But then he asks you something
that would give you the hiccups,

630
00:43:56 --> 00:44:02
and that is what is now the
time-averaged power dissipated

631
00:44:01 --> 00:44:07
in that light bulb?
And you will remember,

632
00:44:04 --> 00:44:10
or should remember,
that one half I squared R is

633
00:44:08 --> 00:44:14
the power dissipated in the
light bulb if I is the current

634
00:44:12 --> 00:44:18
through the light bulb and R is
the resistance of the light

635
00:44:17 --> 00:44:23
bulb.
And we will assume that the

636
00:44:21 --> 00:44:27
resistance is independent of the
current, independent of

637
00:44:25 --> 00:44:31
temperature.
But I is changing with time,

638
00:44:28 --> 00:44:34
in a cosinusoidal fashion.
And so now you have to be able

639
00:44:32 --> 00:44:38
to evaluate the time average of
a cosine squared omega T

640
00:44:37 --> 00:44:43
function.
And the time average of a

641
00:44:39 --> 00:44:45
cosine squared or sine squared
omega T function is always one

642
00:44:44 --> 00:44:50
half.
You'd like to remember that,

643
00:44:46 --> 00:44:52
rather than spending five
minutes on deriving that.

644
00:44:50 --> 00:44:56
And so this,
time averaged,

645
00:44:54 --> 00:45:00
is then going to be one half
times I max squared times R --

646
00:44:58 --> 00:45:04
and by the way,
sorry, the -- I was,

647
00:45:01 --> 00:45:07
I was ahead of myself with my,
my -- I squared R is the energy

648
00:45:06 --> 00:45:12
that is dissipated,
right, in the,

649
00:45:09 --> 00:45:15
in the resistor,
not one half I squared R.

650
00:45:12 --> 00:45:18
It is I squared R.
And because of the time-average

651
00:45:16 --> 00:45:22
of the cosine squared function I
get my one half there.

652
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
And so it's very easy now.
I max is 1 ampere,

653
00:45:26 --> 00:45:32
R is 100,
and this factor of one half,

654
00:45:29 --> 00:45:35
which comes from the time
average of the square of this

655
00:45:34 --> 00:45:40
function -- the phi has nothing
to do with that -- the average

656
00:45:39 --> 00:45:45
of co- of the cosine squared of
this function is one half,

657
00:45:43 --> 00:45:49
and you get 50 watts.
And now he calls this device a

658
00:45:48 --> 00:45:54
light dimmer.
Now he is going to increase L

659
00:45:51 --> 00:45:57
to 300 millihenries.
So L now becomes

660
00:45:56 --> 00:46:02
millihenry.
At 300 millihenry,

661
00:46:01 --> 00:46:07
omega L is
ohms.

662
00:46:05 --> 00:46:11
I multiply 300 by the
377.

663
00:46:10 --> 00:46:16
And now I find that this
time-averaged value,

664
00:46:14 --> 00:46:20
which is now one half times
this, I find that I max -- I put

665
00:46:20 --> 00:46:26
in for omega L 113 squared, 100 squared,

666
00:46:26 --> 00:46:32
I max is now 0.67 amperes.

667
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
I put that in this equation and
I find that the power is now

668
00:46:37 --> 00:46:43
about 22 watts.
So that's what a light dimmer

669
00:46:43 --> 00:46:49
is doing for you.
So you turn up the

670
00:46:46 --> 00:46:52
self-inductance,
and now your light is dimmer.

671
00:46:51 --> 00:46:57
Now a very deep,
very deep, maybe nasty,

672
00:46:55 --> 00:47:01
conceptual question.
Why would one want to build a

673
00:47:00 --> 00:47:06
light
dimmer with a self-inductor?

674
00:47:03 --> 00:47:09
Why not put in here a variable
resistor and then turning up the

675
00:47:07 --> 00:47:13
resistor so that the current,
which, when the resistor is

676
00:47:11 --> 00:47:17
0, the current is one ampere,
so you get you 50 watts,

677
00:47:15 --> 00:47:21
but then you increase that
resistor so that the current

678
00:47:18 --> 00:47:24
goes down to 0.67
amperes, and then the light bulb

679
00:47:22 --> 00:47:28
will dissipate 22 joules
per second.

680
00:47:25 --> 00:47:31
Why would you not put here a
variable resistor,

681
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
but why a variable
self-inductor?

682
00:47:30 --> 00:47:36
If you can answer that
question, that shows that you

683
00:47:33 --> 00:47:39
have a deep
insight already in 8.02.

684
00:47:37 --> 00:47:43
I promise you I will not ask

685
00:47:39 --> 00:47:45
this question Wednesday,
but I may ask it on the final.

686
00:47:43 --> 00:47:49
Displacement current.
Displacement current is always

687
00:47:47 --> 00:47:53
a little bit problematic in the
sense that there are not too

688
00:47:52 --> 00:47:58
many problems that you can do
with displacement current.

689
00:47:56 --> 00:48:02
This is here this displacement
current term,

690
00:47:59 --> 00:48:05
that Amp- that,
uh, Maxwell added to Ampere's

691
00:48:02 --> 00:48:08
Law.
The only application at this

692
00:48:05 --> 00:48:11
stage in 8.02 that I can
think of

693
00:48:09 --> 00:48:15
is the one that I hit very hard
during my lectures.

694
00:48:14 --> 00:48:20
You have plate capacitor disks.
They are circular plates.

695
00:48:19 --> 00:48:25
And you charge the capacitor or
discharge the capacitor,

696
00:48:24 --> 00:48:30
and you can calculate now,
using this law,

697
00:48:27 --> 00:48:33
what the magnetic field is in
between the capacitor plates.

698
00:48:33 --> 00:48:39
I advise you to check your
notes from that lecture or watch

699
00:48:38 --> 00:48:44
the lecture again on the web.
The lecture is on the web.

700
00:48:44 --> 00:48:50
Then some fatherly advice when
it comes to the exam itself.

701
00:48:48 --> 00:48:54
I would advise you to read a
problem at least twice to make

702
00:48:53 --> 00:48:59
sure that you fully understand
the text.

703
00:48:55 --> 00:49:01
If you read fast -- at least
that happens to me -- you

704
00:48:59 --> 00:49:05
sometimes misread.
At least, I often misread.

705
00:49:02 --> 00:49:08
I would then advise you to do
the easiest problems first.

706
00:49:06 --> 00:49:12
What may be the easiest for you
may not be, be the easiest for

707
00:49:10 --> 00:49:16
you.
But do the easiest for you

708
00:49:13 --> 00:49:19
first.
If you get stuck on a problem,

709
00:49:16 --> 00:49:22
never spend more than ten
minutes on one problem.

710
00:49:19 --> 00:49:25
Immediately abandon it then,
when you see that it's grinding

711
00:49:23 --> 00:49:29
yourself into a hole,
and go to another problem.

712
00:49:26 --> 00:49:32
Between now and Wednesday,
I would suggest you see tutors

713
00:49:30 --> 00:49:36
if you need them.
You can see your instructor.

714
00:49:33 --> 00:49:39
I have office hours this
afternoon.

715
00:49:35 --> 00:49:41
I'll make myself as much
available today as I can.

716
00:49:39 --> 00:49:45
Tomorrow afternoon I will be in
26-100 working

717
00:49:43 --> 00:49:49
on
the demonstrations for you for

718
00:49:46 --> 00:49:52
next week, so I'm not available
tomorrow.

719
00:49:49 --> 00:49:55
I wish you luck,
and I'll see you on Wednesday.
