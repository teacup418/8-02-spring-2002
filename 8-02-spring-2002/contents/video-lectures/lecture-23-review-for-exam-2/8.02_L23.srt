00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,354



2
00:00:00,354 --> 00:00:03,587
Here are the topics the way I
see them.

3
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:07,756
They're on the web.
Look on the lecture supplement

4
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:10,65
of today and you can download
them.

5
00:00:10,65 --> 00:00:14,819
I want to point out that,
uh, the discount is very

6
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:20,265
reasonable because these magnets
are broken, and when you break a

7
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:24,86
magnet, you end up with two
monopoles, so you get fifty

8
00:00:24,86 --> 00:00:28,008
percent off.
You should know better by

9
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:32,152
looking at
the key equation there,

10
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:37,061
that magnetic monopoles don't
exist, but that's a detail.

11
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:42,145
I want you to appreciate that I
cannot possibly cover today

12
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:46,879
these topics in any depth,
nor can I cover all of these

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,875
during a fifty minute exam.
So please understand that this

14
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:56,872
review is highly incomplete,
and what is not covered today

15
00:00:56,872 --> 00:01:02,682
can and will be on the exam.
I'm interested in concepts.

16
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:07,46
I'm not interested in math.
There will be seven problems.

17
00:01:07,46 --> 00:01:11,641
Five of the seven problems have
only one question.

18
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,286
Two problems have two
questions.

19
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:19,32
I don't think that time with
the length of the exam is going

20
00:01:19,32 --> 00:01:23,159
to be an issue.
This exam was taken by several

21
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,146
instructors.
It took them fifteen to

22
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:29,473
eighteen minutes,
and that's normally my

23
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:33,983
objective.
Courtesy of Professor Belcher,

24
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:36,428
we have old tests on the
website.

25
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:40,782
I don't have the solutions.
There's only so much I can do.

26
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:45,518
I'm very grateful to Professor
Belcher that he made these exams

27
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:48,344
available.
If you can't do some of the

28
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:52,927
problems, I would suggest you
see your tutors or you see your

29
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:55,907
instructor.
I will also be available all

30
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,969
day afternoon,
not tomorrow,

31
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:01,789
because tomorrow afternoon I'll
be

32
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,916
in twenty-six one hundred all
afternoon to work on

33
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,265
demonstrations for the next
week.

34
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:14,659
Many of these problems are
straightforward.

35
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:19,473
You may also want to consult
your study guides.

36
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,822
All right.
Let's first start with

37
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:27,321
Biot-Savart.
There are not too many problems

38
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,67
that one can do with
Biot-Savart.

39
00:02:30,67 --> 00:02:36,007
DB equals mu zero divided by
four pi

40
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:41,544
times the current DL cross R
divided by R squared.

41
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:46,856
That's the formalism.
A classic problem that you

42
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:51,829
probably have done.
We have point P here at a

43
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:57,48
distance D from a wire,
and the current through the

44
00:02:57,48 --> 00:03:01,774
wire is I.
If you want to know what the

45
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:08,443
magnetic field at P is,
you can use Biot-Savart.

46
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:12,833
It would be a stupid thing to
do, but you can do it.

47
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:17,052
You take then a small element
DL here of the wire.

48
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:20,926
This distance is R.
This is the unit vector R,

49
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:23,595
which you have in this
equation.

50
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:28,072
And you can calculate,
then, what the contribution to

51
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:32,721
the magnetic field right here is
-- it comes out of the

52
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:35,82
blackboard -- due to this
section DL.

53
00:03:35,82 --> 00:03:39,78
This angle is theta,
and the sine of theta is D

54
00:03:39,78 --> 00:03:42,351
divided
by R.

55
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:47,897
And then you have to do an
integral over the whole wire,

56
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:52,535
theta zero to pi.
And then you get the magnetic

57
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:56,367
field here.
Not very smart thing to do.

58
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:00,905
A waste of time.
Because clearly the way to do

59
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:06,754
this is to use Ampere's Law,
which is the one at the bottom

60
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:08,77
there.
In which case,

61
00:04:08,77 --> 00:04:15,022
you would construct a closed
loop with radius D.

62
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:18,112
This loop is perpendicular to
the blackboard.

63
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:21,412
I'll try to make you see it
three dimensionally.

64
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:25,203
You have to attach an open
surface to that closed loop.

65
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:28,854
Any open surface will do.
Let's make the open surface

66
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:31,382
flat.
And then we apply Ampere's Law,

67
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:33,909
which is the one at the bottom
there.

68
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:37,49
We don't have the second
portion because there is no

69
00:04:37,49 --> 00:04:41,141
changing electric flux.
We don't deal with kappa M at

70
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,528
all.
So we simply have that B times

71
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:47,531
two pi D, that is going around
in this

72
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:52,552
circle, because I know that B
is tangentially to that circle.

73
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:57,323
I also even know the direction
according to the right-hand

74
00:04:57,323 --> 00:05:00,922
corkscrew rule,
coming out of the blackboard

75
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:03,768
here.
So as I go around the circle,

76
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:08,789
B and the DL that you see there
at the bottom are in the same

77
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:11,719
direction.
So I get two pi B times D

78
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:16,824
equals mu zero times the current
that penetrates that surface,

79
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:21,418
and that is I.
And so the answer is very

80
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:24,625
simple, mu zero I divided by two
pi D.

81
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:28,091
That's the way you would do
this problem,

82
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:31,558
and you would stay away from
Biot-Savart.

83
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:36,931
There is one particular problem
whereby Ampere's Law will fail.

84
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:41,438
Of course, Ampere's Law in
general works when we have

85
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:45,771
cylindrical symmetry.
This is cylindrical symmetry.

86
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:50,017
There is one problem where
Ampere's

87
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:54,134
Law bitterly fails and where
Biot-Savart is highly superior.

88
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:57,203
I have here a conducting loop.
It's a circle.

89
00:05:57,203 --> 00:06:00,761
And you're being asked,
it runs a certain current I,

90
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:04,18
and you're being asked,
what is the magnetic field

91
00:06:04,18 --> 00:06:07,599
right at the center?
It only works for the center.

92
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,087
You could not find what the
magnetic field is here.

93
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:14,645
We did that in class.
You probably also did that for

94
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,575
your homework.
Biot-Savart will immediately

95
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:23,476
give you the answer.
And I will leave you with that.

96
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:29,58
And Ampere's Law won't work.
So let's now turn to Ampere's

97
00:06:29,58 --> 00:06:34,185
Law and do a few problems with
Ampere's Law.

98
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:39,968
We need cylindrical symmetry,
with very few exceptions.

99
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:44,251
I have a hollow cylinder here,
radius R1.

100
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:48,749
Concentric another cylinder
with radius R2.

101
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:55,563
These are very long cylinders.
And assume that there is a

102
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:59,395
current flowing,
I, in this direction on the

103
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:04,742
surface of the inner cylinder,
and the current I is returning

104
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:09,821
on the surface of the outer
cylinder, and the two currents

105
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:14,811
are the same in magnitude.
And I want to know what is the

106
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,841
magnetic field everywhere in
space.

107
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,673
I will make a,
a drawing whereby we only see

108
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:27,197
the cross-section.
So this is R1 and this is R2.

109
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,495
And let's first calculate the
magnetic field for R being

110
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:34,933
larger than R2.
It's immediately obvious that

111
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:39,856
your closed loop that you choose
itself is going to be a circle.

112
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:41,732
That is a must.
Radius R.

113
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:46,186
We use a symmetry argument.
Whatever the magnetic field is

114
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:49,937
at that distance R,
little R, it must be the same

115
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,218
everywhere.
It cannot be any different here

116
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:58,766
in terms of magnitude than there
because of the symmetry

117
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:02,289
of the problem.
We have cylindrical symmetry.

118
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:06,131
We also know that if there is
any magnetic field,

119
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:09,973
that it is going to be
tangential, either in this

120
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:14,055
direction or in that direction.
And so we go around.

121
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:18,378
We make the closed loop
integral, use the equation that

122
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:22,94
we have there at the bottom,
and so you get B times two pi

123
00:08:22,94 --> 00:08:27,023
little R equals mu zero.
And now I have to attach an

124
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:30,118
open
surface to this loop.

125
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:33,116
I will use the surface in the
blackboard.

126
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:37,164
I could use any surface,
but I might as well use a flat

127
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:40,012
surface.
And now I have to know what is

128
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:42,861
the current going through that
surface.

129
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:47,134
Right here, on this surface,
the current is going into the

130
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:50,357
blackboard, and right here,
on this surface,

131
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:53,58
the current is coming out of
the blackboard.

132
00:08:53,58 --> 00:08:57,553
The two magnitudes are the
same, so the net current is

133
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,802
zero.
And so the magnetic field

134
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:04
outside the second cylinder is
zero.

135
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10,418
So let's now look at the area
in between the two cylinders.

136
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:16,504
These are hollow cylinders,
now, this is completely open

137
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:20,046
here and this is completely
open.

138
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:23,144
They are thin,
thin material,

139
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:26,575
thin shells,
are both cylinders.

140
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:32,993
Now of course the closed loop
is going to be one inside the

141
00:09:32,993 --> 00:09:37,993
opening
between the two cylinders.

142
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:42,387
And again, I pick radius R.
And here I go.

143
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:48,175
I get B times two pi R equals
mu zero, but now there is

144
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:54,391
current going through this
surface, and the current that is

145
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:57,821
going through is I.
Not this one,

146
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:00,929
but this one.
And so we get I.

147
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:07,36
And so now we get that B is mu
zero times I divided by two pi

148
00:10:07,36 --> 00:10:10,35
R.
One over R field.

149
00:10:10,35 --> 00:10:14,553
The direction you will find
from the right-hand corkscrew

150
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:17,029
rule.
That's the way I normally do

151
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,356
it.
You take a corkscrew and you

152
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:22,808
turn it clockwise,
it goes into the blackboard,

153
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:26,335
so the magnetic field here is
in this direction.

154
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:30,012
If you're not used to turning
corkscrews in corks,

155
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:33,689
think about when you try to
tighten a screw with a

156
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:36,09
screwdriver.
If you go clockwise,

157
00:10:36,09 --> 00:10:41,193
the screw goes in.
At least, that is the case with

158
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:45,871
ninety-nine point nine nine
percent of all screws that you

159
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,564
find in this country.
They have a right-handed

160
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:52,519
thread.
You could make one that has a

161
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,196
left-handed threa- thread,
but that's not done in general.

162
00:10:57,196 --> 00:11:00,725
So now we can go to the area R
less than R1.

163
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:04,09
So that's inside this thin
shell cylinder,

164
00:11:04,09 --> 00:11:08,193
and again, you would take a
surface, a closed loop,

165
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:12,543
that is a circle with radius
little R,

166
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:17,773
and this is your surface
attached, open surface attached

167
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:22,527
to that closed loop.
And you will find for the same

168
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:28,328
reason that you found here that
B is zero, because there is no

169
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:31,561
current going through that
surface.

170
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:36,982
And so if you now make a plot
of the magnetic field B as a

171
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:40,5
function of R,
here is R1, here is R2,

172
00:11:40,5 --> 00:11:45,67
then it is
zero here, it's zero there,

173
00:11:45,67 --> 00:11:51,083
it has some value here,
which is this value if you

174
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:57,491
substitute for little R R1 and
right here it is this value,

175
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:01,136
if you substitute for little R
R2.

176
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:07,101
And this is a curve that is
proportional to one over R.

177
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:12,073
And so this is the magnetic
field, and inside,

178
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:17,859
seen from where you were
sitting, it is clockwise.

179
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:21,19
There is one case,
and we did that in lectures,

180
00:12:21,19 --> 00:12:25,317
whereby we wanted to calculate
the magnetic field inside a

181
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:28,502
solenoid, where Ampere's Law
works very well,

182
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:32,918
even though we don't have then
closed loops which are circles,

183
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,394
we chose a rectangle.
I want you to revisit that.

184
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:40,448
It's undoubtedly in your book,
and I covered it during my

185
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:43,127
lectures.
We assumed that the magnetic

186
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:47,254
field was uniform inside the
solenoid and

187
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:53,476
zero outside the solenoid,
which was not a bad assumption,

188
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:58,17
and that allows you then,
with Ampere's Law,

189
00:12:58,17 --> 00:13:03,301
even though you go rectangular
and not circular,

190
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:07,996
to get the magnetic field
inside a solenoid.

191
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,362
Very classic.
Check your lecture notes or

192
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:17,93
watch my lecture again,
which you can do on the web.

193
00:13:17,93 --> 00:13:22,078
So now I want to turn to
Lorentz force.

194
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:29,174
The Lorentz force,
F, is Q times E plus V cross B.

195
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:33,616
This is the charge which is
moving with velocity V in a

196
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:38,222
magnetic field B and at the
location of that charge there

197
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:41,348
happens to be also an electric
field E.

198
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:45,131
Let's take a situation that I
have an electron.

199
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:49,737
I put a minus sign there to
remind you that the charge is

200
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:53,027
negative.
And let this be the velocity of

201
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:56,564
that electron.
And let the magnetic field be

202
00:13:56,564 --> 00:14:02,65
uniform, perpendicular to the
blackboard in this direction,

203
00:14:02,65 --> 00:14:07,233
going into the blackboard.
There is no electric field,

204
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,518
so we only deal with Q times V
cross B.

205
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:15,792
V cross B -- you should be able
to do that cross product -- is

206
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:19,336
in this direction,
but since the charge is

207
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:24,091
negative, the force on this
charge is in this direction.

208
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:29,451
And so the electron is going to
turn over in this direction and

209
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:35,59
is going to get a circle if the
magnetic field is uniform.

210
00:14:35,59 --> 00:14:40,321
And the force is right at the
center of that circle.

211
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:44,867
A little later in time,
when the electron is here,

212
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:49,228
going with the same speed,
the force is like so.

213
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:54,145
The speed cannot change.
The force cannot do any work,

214
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:58,97
cannot change the kinetic
energy, because F is always

215
00:14:58,97 --> 00:15:02,867
perpendicular to the plane
through V and B,

216
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:08,96
because it's a cross product.
And since the force is always

217
00:15:08,96 --> 00:15:13,429
perpendicular to the velocity,
you cannot change the kinetic

218
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,686
energy, because you're never
doing any work.

219
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:21,155
The only thing that the force
is doing is make it go around.

220
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:24,185
It changes the direction of the
velocity.

221
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:27,745
It doesn't change the magnitude
of the velocity.

222
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:30,623
It doesn't change the speed.
All right?

223
00:15:30,623 --> 00:15:35,017
So let this radius be little R.
Combining eight oh two with

224
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:39,068
eight oh
one, we now have that M V

225
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:44,428
squared over R -- M being the
mass of the electron -- is that

226
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:47,734
force.
And since V is perpendicular to

227
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:53,451
B, the sine of the angle between
them is one, and so I simply get

228
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:56,936
here Q V B.
This is the magnitude of the

229
00:15:56,936 --> 00:16:00,152
force.
We already know the direction.

230
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:04,529
And so one V goes,
and so I get that the radius of

231
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:08,817
that circle is M V divided by Q
B.

232
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:11,745
This being the momentum of the
electron.

233
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:14,972
So V is the velocity of the
electron, speed.

234
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:17,975
Q is the charge.
B is the magnetic field.

235
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:22,553
M is the mass of the electron.
And as long as this velocity is

236
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:25,706
reasonably smaller than the
speed of light,

237
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:29,609
we don't have to make a
relativistic correction here.

238
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:33,211
If it's not much smaller than
the speed of light,

239
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:36,289
we have to make a relativistic
correction.

240
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:41,936
I discussed the relativistic
correction in my lectures,

241
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:46,91
but I also mentioned that that
would not be part of exams,

242
00:16:46,91 --> 00:16:50,314
so I will not further elaborate
on that.

243
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:54,241
So we will just assume that
this is completely

244
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:58,256
non-relativistic.
The time for this electron to

245
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:02,271
go around, capital T,
is two pi R divided by V.

246
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,587
But I know R,
so I get two pi times M V

247
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:10,212
divided by Q B.
And then I have this V,

248
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:13,718
and I lose this V,
and that is not so intuitive,

249
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:18,044
but you see that the time is
independent of the velocity of

250
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:20,357
the electron,
assuming that it's

251
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:23,713
non-relativistic.
And we discussed that in the

252
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:27,741
framework of cyclotrons,
time for these particles to go

253
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,501
around is independent of the
velocity.

254
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:34,901
Suppose I have a magnetic field
B which is seven point eight

255
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:37,363
times ten to the minus four
tesla.

256
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:39,675
Now I know what you're
thinking.

257
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:44,495
You're thinking,
why the hell do you take this

258
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:47,466
crazy value?
There is a reason for that,

259
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,133
because I have a demonstration
here.

260
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:54,628
And the magnetic field is seven
point eight times ten to the

261
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:57,524
minus four tesla.
If that is the field,

262
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:01,028
I can calculate how long it
takes to go around,

263
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:05,6
because I know the mass of the
electron, I know the charge of

264
00:18:05,6 --> 00:18:08,571
the electron,
I know the magnetic field.

265
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:11,314
So in that case,
T is about forty-six

266
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:14,59
nanoseconds.
And so the number of times that

267
00:18:14,59 --> 00:18:17,691
it
goes around,

268
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:24,576
F, which is the frequency in
hertz, is one over the period,

269
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:30,275
is about twenty-two megahertz.
So it goes around,

270
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:35,261
this electron,
twenty-two million times per

271
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:39,534
second.
The demonstration that I will

272
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:44,046
show you.
We have a, a glass container,

273
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:49,031
spherical.
It's about yea big.

274
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:53,116
You can see it there.
There is low pressure gas in

275
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:57,617
there, so that some of the
electrons can go around in a

276
00:18:57,617 --> 00:19:00,367
circle before they ionize the
gas.

277
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:04,368
We will accelerate the
electrons over a potential

278
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:08,869
difference, which I can vary
from zero to three hundred

279
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:11,37
volts.
And so I can give them a

280
00:19:11,37 --> 00:19:15,371
certain velocity.
Suppose I gave them a potential

281
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:19,455
difference of hundred volts,
then Q times delta V,

282
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:23,829
which is the
potential difference,

283
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:29,045
would then be one half M V
squared, and so if I make this

284
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:33,144
one hundred volts,
I can calculate what V is,

285
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:38,08
and I've found that the
velocity of the electrons then

286
00:19:38,08 --> 00:19:43,204
is about five point nine times
ten to the six meters per

287
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:46,371
second.
So that's the velocity if I

288
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:50,842
have a potential difference of
one hundred volts.

289
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:56,751
And so I can use that velocity,
substitute that in this

290
00:19:56,751 --> 00:20:00,932
equation, and then I get the
radius of these electrons in

291
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:04,666
that magnetic field,
and that radius turns out then

292
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,652
to be about four point three
centimeters.

293
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:11,834
And that is a little smaller
than the sphere that I have.

294
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:15,418
How can I create a uniform
magnetic field of that

295
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:19,375
magnitude, that's indeed
perpendicular to the orbit of

296
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,362
the electrons?
We do that using Helmholtz

297
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:25,572
coals- uh, coils.
We never discussed that in

298
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:28,972
detail
during our lectures.

299
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:32,346
You see here coils,
and you see here coils.

300
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:35,962
And when you have two sets of
coils like that,

301
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:39,417
and you have a proper distance
between them,

302
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:44,158
you can create between them a
magnetic field which is almost

303
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,926
constant.
In this case,

304
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:49,702
this is the field,
fifteen times larger than the

305
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:53,8
Earth's magnetic field.
Perhaps some of you remember

306
00:20:53,8 --> 00:20:58,058
that I linked you on the eight
oh two

307
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:01,715
website a few weeks ago to a
very nice program that I

308
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:06,004
received from Professor Belcher
which allowed you to calculate

309
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:09,379
magnetic field configurations
with current loops.

310
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:12,965
And one of the things I asked
you on the website is,

311
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:16,058
try to create what we call a
magnetic bottle.

312
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:19,574
This is a magnetic bottle.
It's also referred to as

313
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:22,808
Helmholtz coils,
whereby you can create between

314
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:25,551
two coils a near-uniform
magnetic field.

315
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:29,558
And so that's what we have
here, and I'm going to show you

316
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,939
now how
beautiful these electrons go

317
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:38,042
around in circles.
They ionize the gas inside,

318
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:42,418
and then through de-excitation
of the ionization,

319
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:46,977
you will see light.
Just the same idea that you see

320
00:21:46,977 --> 00:21:49,621
from Aurora.
So in that sense,

321
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:54,544
you're seeing an artificial
Aurora inside a glass tube.

322
00:21:54,544 --> 00:22:00,106
I have to make it very dark for
this, because the light is not

323
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:05,121
very bright.
So we have to turn this off.

324
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:07,998
And I have to turn all this
off.

325
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:13,29
And I have to turn this off.
And some of you who are close

326
00:22:13,29 --> 00:22:17,467
can actually see the light
immediately in the,

327
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:21,088
in the sphere right here in
front of me.

328
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:25,915
But if not, then you will see
it there on the screen.

329
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:31,3
So this is the -- let me make
sure that I can have my -- so

330
00:22:31,3 --> 00:22:37,545
this is the electron gun here.
It has a potential difference

331
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:40,498
which I set roughly at a hundred
volts.

332
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:43,994
And here you see these
electrons going around.

333
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:48,191
And they go around roughly
twenty-two million times per

334
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:51,066
second.
And the gas pressure is low so

335
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:55,65
that some of them make it all
the way before they ionize the

336
00:22:55,65 --> 00:22:58,215
gas.
And I can change the delta V.

337
00:22:58,215 --> 00:23:02,877
I now make the speed lower by
making the potential difference

338
00:23:02,877 --> 00:23:08,782
over which I accelerate the
electrons, by making that lower.

339
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:13,592
The radius is proportional to
the square root of that

340
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:17,384
potential difference.
So now you see here,

341
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:22,933
when I increase the potential
difference, the radius goes up.

342
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,893
See how beautiful that circle
is?

343
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:30,887
It's absolutely amazing.
Very, very nice demonstration.

344
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:36,436
And then we reach the edge of
the -- we are now very close to

345
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:42,191
the diameter of the,
of the glass sphere,

346
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:49,892
so we can't go much further.
So now I want to discuss with

347
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:55,973
you Faraday's Law.
Faraday's Law comes in many

348
00:23:55,973 --> 00:24:02,053
different ways.
Faraday's Law -- I will get up

349
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:07,593
the, get the Maxwell's equations
up again.

350
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:14,096
Faraday's Law --
Faraday's Law tells you that

351
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:17,62
the induced EMF is minus D phi
DT.

352
00:24:17,62 --> 00:24:23,921
D phi DT is the magnetic flux
change through an open surface

353
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:29,154
attached to a loop.
The loop could be somewhere in

354
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:33,212
your brains or it could be a
real loop.

355
00:24:33,212 --> 00:24:36,736
You can imagine any loop in
space.

356
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:40,794
That is always correct,
that statement.

357
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:46,988
So the EMF induced equals minus
D phi DT, minus D DT of the

358
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:50,665
integral
of B dot DA,

359
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:54,562
open surface.
You can think of many ways of

360
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:59,666
changing the magnetic flux.
One way is a stationary loop

361
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:03,007
and having a changing magnetic
field.

362
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:07,739
Another way is of having B
constant but changing the

363
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:13,028
geometry so that the magnetic
flux is changing through the

364
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:18,411
surface, if you rotate it around
or you move things around.

365
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:25,036
Let's look at both today.
Let's first take the stationary

366
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:28,139
loop.
I spent a major part of one

367
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:32,503
lecture on that.
Say this is a conducting wire

368
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:35,704
and it has a resistance capital
R.

369
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:39,68
This is net resistance of the
entire wire.

370
00:25:39,68 --> 00:25:44,432
And suppose here I have a
changing magnetic field,

371
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:49,572
and this area right here is A.
And the magnetic field,

372
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:55,391
let's say, is perpendicular to
the blackboard.

373
00:25:55,391 --> 00:26:01,031
And the strength of the field
is B, and so the magnetic flux

374
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:04,185
phi of B is then simply A times
B.

375
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:07,723
And so D phi DT is then A times
DB DT.

376
00:26:07,723 --> 00:26:12,694
Remember we were going to keep
the geometry constant.

377
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:17,76
It's a s- it's a stationary
system, but we're going to

378
00:26:17,76 --> 00:26:22,636
change the magnetic field.
So this magnetic field is

379
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:27,702
changing.
Perhaps it's coming out of the

380
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:31,819
blackboard now,
and maybe it's increasing.

381
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:37,141
And so you induce then in this
conducting wire an EMF,

382
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:43,066
and the EMF has this magnitude.
This is the magnitude of the

383
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:46,882
induced EMF.
And so the current that is

384
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:51,099
going to flow,
that is the induced current,

385
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:56,823
is the induced EMF divided by
the resistance of that whole

386
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:01,658
conducting loop.
The direction is never an

387
00:27:01,658 --> 00:27:05,044
issue, because you all can
handle Lenz's Law.

388
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:08,276
Notice I didn't even put a
minus sign here,

389
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:11,585
because the EMF is of course
minus D phi DT.

390
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:15,894
That's not important for me if
you put a minus sign here,

391
00:27:15,894 --> 00:27:19,972
but I put these bars there,
so get rid of minus signs.

392
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,512
Because if the magnetic field
is coming out of the board and

393
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:28,206
if it were increasing,
then Lenz's Law will run a

394
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:32,131
current in this direction to
oppose

395
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:35,534
that increase.
And so minus signs in general

396
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:39,333
are for the birds.
You can always reason in which

397
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:43,924
direction the current is going.
So that's a case whereby we

398
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:48,278
have a stationary loop and
whereby the magnetic field is

399
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:52,948
changing but not the geometry.
Now we'll have a case whereby

400
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:55,797
the magnetic field,
say, is constant.

401
00:27:55,797 --> 00:28:00,15
So we have here a conducting
wire and we have a magnetic

402
00:28:00,15 --> 00:28:04,346
field, for instance,
coming out of the

403
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:09,037
blackboard, uniform -- uniform
is always nice when we do

404
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:14,069
integration to get this flux.
It's always nice to have it be

405
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:17,14
uniform.
And we have a bar here which

406
00:28:17,14 --> 00:28:20,125
has length L.
This is length L here.

407
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,219
And we move the bar with
velocity V to the right.

408
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:29,336
So this is a very simple case.
V is here perpendicular to the

409
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:32,066
bar.
That makes it always easier.

410
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:37,78
And B is perpendicular to the
plane through V and L,

411
00:28:37,78 --> 00:28:43,236
so that makes all sines of
theta that we may have,

412
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:46,353
or cosines of theta,
all one.

413
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:52,143
Magnetic field is constant,
and so the magnetic flux,

414
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:57,264
phi of B, is the area times the
magnetic field.

415
00:28:57,264 --> 00:29:04,056
The angles are just wonderful,
so that is B times X times L if

416
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:09,511
this distance is X.
So the magnetic flux change in

417
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:14,354
time,
D phi B DT -- notice I don't

418
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:19,523
care about minus signs.
I don't need n- minus signs.

419
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:24,389
That D phi DT is there for L
times B times DX DT,

420
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:30,065
and DX DT is the velocity.
So the magnitude of the EMF is

421
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:33,309
L B V.
And so the current that is

422
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:36,755
going to flow,
the induced current,

423
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:40,303
is that value,
L B V, divided by the

424
00:29:40,303 --> 00:29:44,958
resistance R,
and that is the resistance,

425
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,302
then, that is in this entire
loop.

426
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:50,57
Whatever there is and where it
is I don't care,

427
00:29:50,57 --> 00:29:53,412
but that is the magnitude of
the current.

428
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:56,822
The direction is again easy,
it's non-negotiable.

429
00:29:56,822 --> 00:30:00,516
If I move this bar to the
right, the magnetic flux is

430
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:02,79
increasing.
It's pointing in this

431
00:30:02,79 --> 00:30:07,124
direction, the magnetic field,
so the current is going to flow

432
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:10,463
in such a direction that it
opposes that change,

433
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:15,08
and so the current will flow in
this direction.

434
00:30:15,08 --> 00:30:20,049
That's the induced current,
and this is the magnitude.

435
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,267
In nineteen ninety-six,
NASA attached a twenty

436
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:29,516
kilometer conducting wire called
a tether to the shuttle,

437
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:34,953
so L was twenty kilometers.
The magnetic field of the Earth

438
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:39,359
is about half a gauss.
Even at a distance of two

439
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,577
hundred miles,
that is not much different from

440
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:47,307
here.
So that is five times ten to

441
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:50,005
the minus five tesla.
And the shuttle,

442
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:54,089
as you should know from eight
oh one, like any near-Earth

443
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:58,538
satellite, they all fly with a
speed of about eight kilometers

444
00:30:58,538 --> 00:31:01,018
per second.
If they go much faster,

445
00:31:01,018 --> 00:31:04,665
then they will leave the
gravitational field of the

446
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,123
Earth.
So V is about,

447
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:09,551
in circular orbit,
is about eight kilometers per

448
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:12,177
second.
So here you have it in meters

449
00:31:12,177 --> 00:31:16,625
per second.
If I calculate for this tether,

450
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,306
moved around,
if I calculate L B V,

451
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:23,958
I would get eight kilovolts.
However, keep in mind that that

452
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:27,979
is only correct if B were
perpendicular to the plane

453
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:32,395
through L V, and also if the
velocity of the shuttle were

454
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:35,706
perpendicular to the direction
of the wire.

455
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:39,964
None of that is the case.
The magnetic field where they

456
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,512
were is not exactly
perpendicular to the plane

457
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:47,06
through V and L.
And so what they observed was

458
00:31:47,06 --> 00:31:52,81
three and a half kilovolts,
about half of the maximum that

459
00:31:52,81 --> 00:31:55,09
you could achieve.
You may say,

460
00:31:55,09 --> 00:31:58,662
gee, this is strange,
because if you just drag a

461
00:31:58,662 --> 00:32:03,07
conducting wire through space,
you don't have a closed loop

462
00:32:03,07 --> 00:32:07,631
circuit, so you can't talk about
the idea of a magnetic flux,

463
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:12,115
because you have no surface.
Well, at the altitude where the

464
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:15,687
shuttle is flying,
there is still a teeny-weenie

465
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:18,651
little bit of air,
very little but some,

466
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:22,452
and that is highly ionized
because

467
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:25,512
of the ultraviolet light from
the sun.

468
00:32:25,512 --> 00:32:28,985
We call that the ionosphere.
It's a plasma.

469
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:33,369
And so in the surrounding of
this wire, here and here,

470
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:38,331
you have a conducting medium.
And so current can flow through

471
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:43,046
that medium, this way or this
way, and that's exactly what

472
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,858
will happen.
So that you don't know

473
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:48,918
precisely the path.
Current will flow,

474
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:54,468
so you do have closed loops.
And so it is meaningful to talk

475
00:32:54,468 --> 00:32:57,297
about magnetic flux change and
about the EMF,

476
00:32:57,297 --> 00:33:00,704
the induced EMF that is
generated as a result of that.

477
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:04,176
The thing that NASA could not
predict very well was the

478
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:07,841
current, because you do not
quite know what the resistance

479
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:11,313
is of that closed loop.
You know what the resistance is

480
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:13,885
of the cable,
but you don't know what the

481
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:17,293
resistance is of the currents as
they flow through the

482
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:19,736
ionosphere.
But the net result was that

483
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:23,079
they had a current I in their
wire

484
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:26,555
of about one ampere.
It was very tragic,

485
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:31,545
because this current was so
high that the conducting wire

486
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:36,713
melted, and the tether broke
off, and very early on in that

487
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:41,08
experiment, the tether separated
from the shuttle.

488
00:33:41,08 --> 00:33:46,515
But this is a marvelous example
of where you have motional EMF

489
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:50,08
in space.
I want you to think about it at

490
00:33:50,08 --> 00:33:52,842
home.
Where does the energy come

491
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:56,594
from?
Because you're generating

492
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:59,271
current.
You could have lit a light

493
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,634
bulb.
The energy must come from

494
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:03,761
somewhere.
Think about that.

495
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:06,36
Conceptually interesting
question.

496
00:34:06,36 --> 00:34:10,534
By the way, I linked you on the
website to the tether.

497
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:15,181
All you have to do is click on
it and you will get some more

498
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:18,41
information on this incredible
experiment.

499
00:34:18,41 --> 00:34:21,403
All right.
Let's continue with the most

500
00:34:21,403 --> 00:34:26,523
important contribution,
Faraday to our economy.

501
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:31,125
And that is the situation
whereby we rotate a loop,

502
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,991
a current loop,
conducting loop -- could be

503
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:40,514
rectangular, could be circular
-- and we rotate it round with

504
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:44,472
angular frequency omega.
And for simplicity,

505
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:48,707
let's have the magnetic field
just straight up.

506
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:52,389
This is supposed to be three
dimensional.

507
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:56,439
That's my idea.
And let this side be length A

508
00:34:56,439 --> 00:35:02,043
and this B.
So if you look at it from this

509
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:06,003
direction, you will only see the
line.

510
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:12,103
B here is rotating like this,
with angular velocity omega.

511
00:35:12,103 --> 00:35:16,383
And a little later in time
would be here.

512
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:22,697
And so this length here is B.
And so this length is B cosine

513
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:26,229
theta.
And let's assume -- we call

514
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:32,507
this angle theta --
let's assume that it is here at

515
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:35,563
T equals zero when theta is
zero.

516
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:40,052
I can choose that arbitrarily
any way I want to,

517
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:43,967
of course.
And there could be a resistance

518
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:48,456
R in this entire loop.
And so the magnetic flux,

519
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:53,804
phi of B, through a surface
attached to this loop is B --

520
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:58,102
that's constant,
that's not changing -- and we

521
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:04,142
have A times B,
but remember since it is a dot

522
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:10,792
product between B dot DA then
you get a cosine theta in there,

523
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:15,044
so you get A times B times
cosine theta.

524
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:20,168
So that's the flux.
But cosine theta is changing

525
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:23,112
with time.
Theta is omega T,

526
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:29,435
constant angular frequency
omega, so the magnetic flux is A

527
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:33,727
B B cosine omega T.
So D phi DT.

528
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:36,387
Take the derivative,
I get an omega,

529
00:36:36,387 --> 00:36:40,036
I get A, I get B,
I get B, I get sine of omega T.

530
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:43,533
If you're really interested in
that minus sign,

531
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:47,866
you get that automatically,
there's nothing I can do about

532
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:50,147
it.
You get a minus sign there,

533
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:53,644
but I'm not too much interested
in minus signs.

534
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:57,445
But since I get it,
I can't shove it under the rug.

535
00:36:57,445 --> 00:37:02,006
So I put a minus sign here and
I change that into a plus one.

536
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:06,263
The advantage is then that I
have immediately the induced

537
00:37:06,263 --> 00:37:10,493
EMF.
Notice that the induced EMF

538
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:14,234
itself is linearly proportional
with omega.

539
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:19,668
And so my induced current that
is going to run in that loop is

540
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:24,478
the induced EMF divided by the
resistance of that loop.

541
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:28,932
And so if the induced EMF is
proportional to omega,

542
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:33,654
so is the induced current.
So if you go faster around,

543
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:38,909
you get a higher current for
the same resistor.

544
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:42,584
You built motors,
and during the prize ceremony I

545
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:45,876
told you that the faster your
motor rotates,

546
00:37:45,876 --> 00:37:50,393
the larger an induced EMF is
which is generated in the loop.

547
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,833
You had a magnetic field which
let's assume is more or less

548
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,666
constant.
Of course, it wasn't in your

549
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:01,264
case, but let's assume for the
sake of argument.

550
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:05,704
And as your motor was going to
rotate, there was an induced

551
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:10,759
current generated by Mr.
Faraday, which is proportional

552
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:14,485
to omega, so the current is
larger when your motor goes

553
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:16,624
faster.
And that induced current

554
00:38:16,624 --> 00:38:20,349
opposes the current which was
produced by your battery.

555
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:24,42
And perhaps you remember that I
did a demonstration with the

556
00:38:24,42 --> 00:38:27,11
winning motor.
I blocked the rotor and I

557
00:38:27,11 --> 00:38:30,974
showed you that the current
through the rotor when it was

558
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:34,768
blocked, when omega was zero,
was one point six amperes.

559
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,252
Simply Ohm's Law.
Battery, voltage V,

560
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:41,53
resistance R,
the current is V divided by R.

561
00:38:41,53 --> 00:38:45,215
Then we ran the motor,
and the current went down

562
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:47,723
enormously, by a factor of
forty.

563
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:52,193
It was only forty milliamperes,
the time-averaged current,

564
00:38:52,193 --> 00:38:56,348
when the motor was running.
The reason is what you see

565
00:38:56,348 --> 00:38:58,543
here.
You get an induced EMF,

566
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:02,385
an induced current,
which opposes the current from

567
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:04,345
the battery.
L R circuits.

568
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:08,814
I prefer to stay on this center
board, although I could go

569
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:13,126
there, but I don't think we need
these

570
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:15,519
anymore.
Can I cover this?

571
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,485
Most of you are happy with
that.

572
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:22,886
I could work there,
but I prefer to stay at the

573
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:24,8
center.
L R circuits.

574
00:39:24,8 --> 00:39:29,202
With L R circuits,
we have the embarrassment --

575
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:34,847
not for us but for some others
-- that almost all textbooks,

576
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:38,962
college physics,
do not understand Faraday's

577
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:44,033
Law, and therefore they treat
the subject incorrectly.

578
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:49,574
Embarrassing,
but of course since they know

579
00:39:49,574 --> 00:39:52,982
the answer, their answers are
correct.

580
00:39:52,982 --> 00:39:56,113
But their physics is totally
wrong.

581
00:39:56,113 --> 00:40:01,731
I will address a problem which
I found on, on the website when

582
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:05,139
I looked at Professor Belcher's
exams.

583
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:09,375
He has one very nice problem of
an L R circuit.

584
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:12,599
And I will go through that with
you.

585
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,94
We have an AC power supply,
V equals V zero cosine omega T.

586
00:40:17,94 --> 00:40:25,503
The frequency is sixty hertz.
It just comes out of the wall.

587
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:29,035
And so omega,
which is two pi F,

588
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:34,391
is about three hundred
seventy-seven radians per

589
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,923
second.
And V zero in this case,

590
00:40:37,923 --> 00:40:41,569
hundred volts.
And we have here a

591
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:46,583
self-inductor,
and here we have a light bulb.

592
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:52,394
And the light bulb has a
resistance which is hundred

593
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:55,813
ohms.
And this self-inductor is

594
00:40:55,813 --> 00:41:01,637
variable.
We don't know yet how you make

595
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:06,794
a variable self-inductor,
but we will learn that very

596
00:41:06,794 --> 00:41:11,256
shortly, either Friday or next
week, I forgot.

597
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:17,008
This self-inductance can be
increased over a certain range.

598
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:22,76
And the first question that
Professor Belcher is asking is,

599
00:41:22,76 --> 00:41:27,62
what is the energy dissipation
in this light bulb?

600
00:41:27,62 --> 00:41:33,67
The closed loop integral of E
dot DL is not zero,

601
00:41:33,67 --> 00:41:38,144
because Kirchoff's loop rule
does not apply here.

602
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:43,178
There is a self-inductor.
If you attach an open surface

603
00:41:43,178 --> 00:41:47,839
to this closed loop,
there is a magnetic flux going

604
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,034
through there,
so you must deal with the third

605
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:56,043
equation there.
You must deal with Faraday's

606
00:41:56,043 --> 00:42:00,051
Law, no matter what your
textbooks tell you.

607
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,221
Kirchoff's loop rule does not
hold.

608
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:09,382
And if you do that correctly,
you end up with the right

609
00:42:09,382 --> 00:42:13,502
differential equation,
which happens to be the same

610
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:18,446
one that those people find who
do not understand the physics,

611
00:42:18,446 --> 00:42:23,39
but they get the same equation.
They massage things in such a

612
00:42:23,39 --> 00:42:26,109
way that they get the same
answer.

613
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:30,888
And the I- answer then is that
the current that is going to

614
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:35,008
flow as a result of this
voltage, variable voltage,

615
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:39,704
that current I is a maximum
value times the cosine omega T

616
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:45,791
minus phi.
That the maximum current itself

617
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:52,917
is V zero divided by the s-
square root of R squared plus

618
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:58,77
omega L squared.
And that the tangent of phi is

619
00:42:58,77 --> 00:43:05,387
omega L divided by R.
I spent quite some time on this

620
00:43:05,387 --> 00:43:12,64
during one of my lectures.
And so the maximum current that

621
00:43:12,64 --> 00:43:16,78
will
flow depends on omega and

622
00:43:16,78 --> 00:43:20,647
depends on L,
on the self-inductance -- of

623
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:23,666
course on the resistance as
well.

624
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:29,137
In Professor Belcher's problem,
he starts off with L equals

625
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:34,514
zero, and he asks you what is
the power dissipated in this

626
00:43:34,514 --> 00:43:37,155
light bulb.
If L equals zero,

627
00:43:37,155 --> 00:43:41,966
this term is not there,
and so you simply have Ohm's

628
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:45,078
Law, I equals V zero divided by
R.

629
00:43:45,078 --> 00:43:51,294
So I max is hundred divided by
hundred, is one ampere.

630
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:56,354
But then he asks you something
that would give you the hiccups,

631
00:43:56,354 --> 00:44:01,005
and that is what is now the
time-averaged power dissipated

632
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:04,351
in that light bulb?
And you will remember,

633
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:08,186
or should remember,
that one half I squared R is

634
00:44:08,186 --> 00:44:12,837
the power dissipated in the
light bulb if I is the current

635
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:17,57
through the light bulb and R is
the resistance of the light

636
00:44:17,57 --> 00:44:21,204
bulb.
And we will assume that the

637
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:25,448
resistance is independent of the
current, independent of

638
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:28,535
temperature.
But I is changing with time,

639
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:32,856
in a cosinusoidal fashion.
And so now you have to be able

640
00:44:32,856 --> 00:44:37,1
to evaluate the time average of
a cosine squared omega T

641
00:44:37,1 --> 00:44:39,724
function.
And the time average of a

642
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:44,354
cosine squared or sine squared
omega T function is always one

643
00:44:44,354 --> 00:44:46,901
half.
You'd like to remember that,

644
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:50,759
rather than spending five
minutes on deriving that.

645
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:54,231
And so this,
time averaged,

646
00:44:54,231 --> 00:44:58,939
is then going to be one half
times I max squared times R --

647
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:01,78
and by the way,
sorry, the -- I was,

648
00:45:01,78 --> 00:45:06,731
I was ahead of myself with my,
my -- I squared R is the energy

649
00:45:06,731 --> 00:45:09,409
that is dissipated,
right, in the,

650
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:12,737
in the resistor,
not one half I squared R.

651
00:45:12,737 --> 00:45:16,714
It is I squared R.
And because of the time-average

652
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:21,096
of the cosine squared function I
get my one half there.

653
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:26,128
And so it's very easy now.
I max is one ampere,

654
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:29,821
R is one hundred,
and this factor of one half,

655
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:34,253
which comes from the time
average of the square of this

656
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:39,259
function -- the phi has nothing
to do with that -- the average

657
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:43,936
of co- of the cosine squared of
this function is one half,

658
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:48,367
and you get fifty watts.
And now he calls this device a

659
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:51,814
light dimmer.
Now he is going to increase L

660
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:56,738
to three hundred millihenries.
So L now becomes three hundred

661
00:45:56,738 --> 00:46:01,723
millihenry.
At three hundred millihenry,

662
00:46:01,723 --> 00:46:05,389
omega L is hundred and thirteen
ohms.

663
00:46:05,389 --> 00:46:10,378
I multiply three hundred by the
three seven seven.

664
00:46:10,378 --> 00:46:14,859
And now I find that this
time-averaged value,

665
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:20,867
which is now one half times
this, I find that I max -- I put

666
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:26,569
in for omega L hundred thirteen
squared, hundred squared,

667
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:31,769
I max is now oh
point six seven amperes.

668
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:37,792
I put that in this equation and
I find that the power is now

669
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:43,101
about twenty-two watts.
So that's what a light dimmer

670
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:46,674
is doing for you.
So you turn up the

671
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:51,268
self-inductance,
and now your light is dimmer.

672
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:55,249
Now a very deep,
very deep, maybe nasty,

673
00:46:55,249 --> 00:47:00,252
conceptual question.
Why would one want to build a

674
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:03,965
light
dimmer with a self-inductor?

675
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:07,892
Why not put in here a variable
resistor and then turning up the

676
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:11,439
resistor so that the current,
which, when the resistor is

677
00:47:11,439 --> 00:47:15,176
zero, the current is one ampere,
so you get you fifty watts,

678
00:47:15,176 --> 00:47:18,596
but then you increase that
resistor so that the current

679
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:22,586
goes down to oh point six seven
amperes, and then the light bulb

680
00:47:22,586 --> 00:47:25,31
will dissipate twenty-two joules
per second.

681
00:47:25,31 --> 00:47:28,223
Why would you not put here a
variable resistor,

682
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:30,25
but why a variable
self-inductor?

683
00:47:30,25 --> 00:47:33,48
If you can answer that
question, that shows that you

684
00:47:33,48 --> 00:47:37,456
have a deep
insight already in eight oh

685
00:47:37,456 --> 00:47:39,84
two.
I promise you I will not ask

686
00:47:39,84 --> 00:47:43,865
this question Wednesday,
but I may ask it on the final.

687
00:47:43,865 --> 00:47:47,665
Displacement current.
Displacement current is always

688
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:52,062
a little bit problematic in the
sense that there are not too

689
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:56,161
many problems that you can do
with displacement current.

690
00:47:56,161 --> 00:47:59,366
This is here this displacement
current term,

691
00:47:59,366 --> 00:48:02,645
that Amp- that,
uh, Maxwell added to Ampere's

692
00:48:02,645 --> 00:48:05,03
Law.
The only application at this

693
00:48:05,03 --> 00:48:09,427
stage in eight oh two that I can
think of

694
00:48:09,427 --> 00:48:14,004
is the one that I hit very hard
during my lectures.

695
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:19,132
You have plate capacitor disks.
They are circular plates.

696
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:24,167
And you charge the capacitor or
discharge the capacitor,

697
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,921
and you can calculate now,
using this law,

698
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:33,232
what the magnetic field is in
between the capacitor plates.

699
00:48:33,232 --> 00:48:38,542
I advise you to check your
notes from that lecture or watch

700
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:44,86
the lecture again on the web.
The lecture is on the web.

701
00:48:44,86 --> 00:48:48,961
Then some fatherly advice when
it comes to the exam itself.

702
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:53,062
I would advise you to read a
problem at least twice to make

703
00:48:53,062 --> 00:48:55,819
sure that you fully understand
the text.

704
00:48:55,819 --> 00:48:59,567
If you read fast -- at least
that happens to me -- you

705
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:02,678
sometimes misread.
At least, I often misread.

706
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:06,638
I would then advise you to do
the easiest problems first.

707
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:10,951
What may be the easiest for you
may not be, be the easiest for

708
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:13,072
you.
But do the easiest for you

709
00:49:13,072 --> 00:49:16,684
first.
If you get stuck on a problem,

710
00:49:16,684 --> 00:49:19,861
never spend more than ten
minutes on one problem.

711
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:23,765
Immediately abandon in then,
when you see that it's grinding

712
00:49:23,765 --> 00:49:26,876
yourself into a hole,
and go to another problem.

713
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:30,582
Between now and Wednesday,
I would suggest you see tutors

714
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:33,56
if you need them.
You can see your instructor.

715
00:49:33,56 --> 00:49:35,81
I have office hours this
afternoon.

716
00:49:35,81 --> 00:49:39,053
I'll make myself as much
available today as I can.

717
00:49:39,053 --> 00:49:43,09
Tomorrow afternoon I will be in
twenty-six one hundred working

718
00:49:43,09 --> 00:49:46,411
on
the demonstrations for you for

719
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:49,074
next week, so I'm not available
tomorrow.

720
00:49:49,074 --> 49:54
I wish you luck,
and I'll see you on Wednesday.
