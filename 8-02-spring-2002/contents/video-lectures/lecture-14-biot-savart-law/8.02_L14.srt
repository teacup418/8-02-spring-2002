1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,061



2
00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:07,383
Well, we have a current  going
through a wire,

3
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:13,078
like so.
And we look at the magnetic

4
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:21,702
field in the vicinity of this
wire , then we know from

5
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:33,744
experiment that if you put
pieces of magnetite around

6
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:37,405
the wire that they line up in a
circle.

7
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:42,32
Put around like this.
If that circle has a radius R,

8
00:00:42,32 --> 00:00:47,428
then the magnetic fields,
that's an experimental fact,

9
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:52,246
is proportional with the
current I and is inversely

10
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:56,39
proportional with the radius of
that circle.

11
00:00:56,39 --> 00:01:00,534
By convention,
the direction of the magnetic

12
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:05,738
fields given by the right-hand
corkscrew,

13
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:08,707
rotate this way,
the current goes up.

14
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:12,09
You've seen before,
with electric charges,

15
00:01:12,09 --> 00:01:16,957
when you have a wire which is
uniformly distributed say with

16
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:20,751
positive charge,
you've also seen that electric

17
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:25,701
fields in the vicinity of that
straight wire falls off as one

18
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:30,568
over R, whereas the direction is
different than the magnetic

19
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:35,435
field but it also falls off as
one over R, and the reason is

20
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:40,1
that electric monopoles,
individual charges,

21
00:01:40,1 --> 00:01:43,909
the electric fields fall off as
one over R squared.

22
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:48,633
And so when you integrate that
out over a straight wire you get

23
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:51,3
the one over R field.
So by analogy,

24
00:01:51,3 --> 00:01:55,947
it would be very plausible that
if you took magnetic monopoles

25
00:01:55,947 --> 00:02:00,214
that the magnetic field would
also fall off as one over R

26
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:04,861
squared, but magnetic monopoles
as far as we know don't exist.

27
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:10,33
In principle they could exist,
but we've never seen one,

28
00:02:10,33 --> 00:02:15,495
and if any one of you ever find
one, that would certainly be a

29
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:18,882
Nobel Prize.
It's by no means impossible.

30
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:24,131
And so the simple fact that the
magnetic field around a current

31
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:28,958
wire falls off as one over R,
sort of suggests that if you

32
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:33,784
carve this wire up in little
elements DL, that each one of

33
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:38,949
those elements contributes to
the magnetic fields

34
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:44,251
in inverse R-squared law,
and by integrating out over the

35
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:48,702
whole wire you'd then get the
one over R fields.

36
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:54,005
And this behind the idea of the
formalism by Biot-Savart,

37
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:59,308
who introduced the idea that if
you have a little current

38
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:03,853
element DL, and the current is
in this direction,

39
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:08,304
and you want to know what the
magnetic field is,

40
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:12,566
This is small contribution DB
to

41
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:16,283
that little current element,
and the distance is R,

42
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:20,521
and the unit vector from the
element DL to the point where

43
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:23,867
you want to know the magnetic
field is R roof.

44
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:27,659
Then the idea here is DB,
it's a little bit of curr-

45
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,194
little bit of magnetic fields.
In this case it would be in the

46
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:36,06
blackboards because of the
right-hand corkscrew rule.

47
00:03:36,06 --> 00:03:39,629
The current is in this
direction, so these little

48
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,239
elements would contribute to
magnetic fields in

49
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,648
this direction perpendicular to
the blackboard.

50
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:51,28
It's some constant,
proportional to the current no

51
00:03:51,28 --> 00:03:54,986
doubt, and then it's
proportional to the lengths of

52
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:58,396
that little element DL,
if it's longer than the

53
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:01,954
magnetic field is larger,
and in order to get the

54
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:06,327
direction right perpendicular to
the blackboard you take the

55
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,996
cross product with the unit
vector R.

56
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:13,443
The unit vector R has length
one so you only do that in order

57
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:19,069
to get the direction right.
And this, and that inversely

58
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:23,039
proportional to R squared.
That's of course key.

59
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,417
And this is,
the formalism by Biot-Savart

60
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:31,4
and you can do experiments and
measure the magnetic field in

61
00:04:31,4 --> 00:04:35,286
the vicinity of wires and this
formalism works,

62
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:40,015
so you then calculate the
individual contributions of all

63
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:46,687
these little elements DL and
then you do an integration and

64
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:51,351
this formalism works.
You can then also measure what

65
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:55,557
C is, in SI units.
C is ten to the minus seven.

66
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:59,488
But we write for C something
quite peculiar.

67
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:05,066
We write for C mu zero divided
by four pi, and we call this mu

68
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:08,266
zero the permeability of free
space.

69
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:13,387
You've seen earlier with
Coulomb's law that this constant

70
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:20,213
nine times ten to the ninth,
we call that one over four pi

71
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:23,714
epsilon zero.
What is in the name?

72
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:29,126
And so here we call this mu
zero divided by four pi.

73
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:34,644
So now you can apply
Biot-Savart's Law and you can go

74
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:40,904
to a straight wire and you have
a current I, and suppose you

75
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:47,589
want to know what the magnetic
field at that location

76
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:52,814
is at a distant capital R,
and so what you now have to do,

77
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:57,489
if you carve this up,
in an infinite number of small

78
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:02,806
elements DL, and this distance
is R, and the unit vector is

79
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:06,472
then like so,
and you calculate the small

80
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:11,788
amount of magnetic field due to
this little element and you

81
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,905
integrate this over the whole
wire.

82
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:19,122
It's mathematics.
You've done it.

83
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:23,209
You've done it before,
where we had uniformly electric

84
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,757
charge on the wire.
So I'm not going to do this

85
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:29,919
again for you.
It's a very straightforward

86
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,852
piece of mathematics.
The magnetic field by the way,

87
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,474
in this case,
would come out of the

88
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:39,251
blackboards.
Thus it's the right-hand

89
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,644
corkscrew rule.
And what you find when you do

90
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:46,346
this, we will find that B equals
mu zero times I,

91
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:50,514
divided by two pi R,
this being R,

92
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:56,478
and so you indeed see that the
inverse one over R comes out.

93
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,208
And so if you,
for instance,

94
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:04,565
take a radius of oh point one
meters, ten centimeters,

95
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:10,328
and you have a current through
the wire of about a hundred

96
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:14,877
amperes, then you would end up
with a B field.

97
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:20,841
You use this equation two times
ten to the minus four Tesla.

98
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:25,841
That is about two Gauss.
Hundred amperes.

99
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:28,809
Ten centimeter distance is only
two Gauss.

100
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:31,995
Think about it.
The Earth's magnetic field is

101
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:34,89
half a Gauss.
So if you go one meter away

102
00:07:34,89 --> 00:07:37,859
from the wire,
so we have a magnetic field

103
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:41,478
which is ten times lower
[inaudible] is one over R,

104
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,315
than the magnetic field of the
Earth already dominates

105
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:48,501
substantially.
So you need very high current,

106
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,324
actually, when you do these
experiments.

107
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:57,106
It's nice to see that out of
Biot-Savart's formalism the one

108
00:07:57,106 --> 00:08:00,743
over R pops out,
but of course you must realize

109
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:05,566
that Biot-Savart knew that the
magnetic field falls off as one

110
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:08,491
over R.
That was an experimental fact.

111
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:12,84
So the fact that it falls out
is logical, because it was

112
00:08:12,84 --> 00:08:16,714
cooked into that formalism.
If you think about it,

113
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:21,063
it all goes back to Newton.
Newton was the one who first

114
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:26,519
suggested that the gravitational
field falls off as one

115
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,447
over R squared.
And then later a logical

116
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:33,877
extension was that the electric
fields would fall off as one

117
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:38,532
over R squared and out of that
came the idea that the fields of

118
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:41,461
magnetic monopole,
if they only existed,

119
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:45,816
would fall off as one over R
squared, and that's all behind

120
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,796
this and so the person who
really deserves most of the

121
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,799
credit for all this in my book
is Newton.

122
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,28
Using  Biot-Savart,
we can calculate now easily the

123
00:08:58,28 --> 00:09:02,59
magnetic fields at the center
of a current loop.

124
00:09:02,59 --> 00:09:07,633
Let this be a wire circle and
let the current go in this

125
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:13,318
direction, and I would ask you
what is the magnetic field right

126
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:17,353
at the center.
Well, the magnetic field right

127
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:21,296
at the center of course is
pointing upwards.

128
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:25,239
Each little element along the
line here, DL,

129
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:31,109
each little element will
contribute a little bit

130
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:36,709
magnetic field at that point
right in this direction.

131
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,555
And if this radius is R,
with Biot-Savart now,

132
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:47,91
we can calculate quite easily
the total field that you would

133
00:09:47,91 --> 00:09:53,079
get at this location,
because that total field is

134
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:59,002
then the integral of DB
factorially over the entire wire

135
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:04,711
so the entire loop...
So if you go there,

136
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:09,574
so you would get your mu zero,
divided by four pi,

137
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:15,133
you get your current and you
get your one over R squared,

138
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:20,493
and now we have to do an
integral over that DL cross R.

139
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:25,158
Well, R is of course always
perpendicular to DL.

140
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:31,014
Any element DL that you choose,
the unit vector R is exactly

141
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:37,069
perpendicular to the element DL,
because that's characteristic

142
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,493
of a
circle.

143
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:44,967
And so the sine of the angle
between DL and R is one,

144
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:50,23
and so all we have to do is do
an integral over DL,

145
00:10:50,23 --> 00:10:55,282
which is the integral of the
circle, which is the

146
00:10:55,282 --> 00:11:00,44
circumference of the circle,
and that is two pi R.

147
00:11:00,44 --> 00:11:05,177
And so now you find,
lose a pi, you lose an R,

148
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:11,072
so we find mu zero times I
divided by two R.

149
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:15,079
Just to show you an example,
how in this case how easy it is

150
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:19,359
to use Biot-Savart and calculate
the magnetic field right at the

151
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,601
center.
If you were asked what the

152
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:25,065
magnetic field was here or
there, that would be also

153
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:27,307
relatively easy.
You've done that.

154
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:30,703
I've given you a problem
earlier where we had point

155
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:34,983
charges uniformly distributed on
a wire and I asked you what the

156
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:38,515
electric field was here.
So that can also be done now

157
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:43,067
with magnetic fields.
If I ever asked you what the

158
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:46,616
magnetic fields would be here,
that of course is an

159
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:50,592
impossibility to do that with
Biot-Savart, practically an

160
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:53,787
impossibility.
I wouldn't know how to do that.

161
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:57,55
But in principle it could be
done and certainly with a

162
00:11:57,55 --> 00:12:00,887
computer you can do it.
So we can go to our same

163
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:05,431
situation, we can take a hundred
amperes for I and you can take R

164
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:09,833
oh point one meters and then the
B field, the strength of the B

165
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,951
field right at the center of
this loop that I found is then

166
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,671
six times ten to
the minus four Tesla.

167
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:23,668
And that would be six Gauss.
It's clear that if you want to

168
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:27,545
put in some field lines,
magnetic field lines,

169
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:32,025
as a result of this current
going around in a circle,

170
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:37,194
that the- through the center
there would be a field line like

171
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:39,779
so.
If you're very close to the

172
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:44,948
wire here, which goes into the
blackboards, I want you to see

173
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:50,981
this three-dimensionally,
then the magnetic fields would

174
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:53,029
go like this,
clockwise.

175
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:58,284
Here the current comes to you,
so would be counterclockwise.

176
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:02,025
If the magnetic field line is
here like so,

177
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:06,835
and here it is curled up,
then clearly I expect them to

178
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:10,13
be here, sort of like so,
and like so,

179
00:13:10,13 --> 00:13:13,693
and like so.
This is the kind of magnetic

180
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:17,612
field line configuration that I
would expect,

181
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:21,531
then, in the vicinity of such a
current loop.

182
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,758

183
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:28,576
And I want to show this to you
in a little bit more detail.

184
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:33,31
I have here a transparency,
and you see there on the right

185
00:13:33,31 --> 00:13:38,045
side, current goes into the
paper and here it comes out of

186
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:40,953
the paper.
There is a circular loop.

187
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,691
And you see here the field line
configuration.

188
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:49,343
It's not too different from
what I have on the blackboard

189
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:53,663
there.
Very close to the wires,

190
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:58,598
of course, you get circles
because the one over R dominates

191
00:13:58,598 --> 00:14:01,662
there.
It's so close to the wire that

192
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:06,513
the one over R relationship
makes it come out like circles

193
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:10,258
and here too,
but then if you're farther away

194
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:13,662
you get configurations like I
have there.

195
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:17,491
When you're very far away from
a current loop,

196
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:21,746
the magnetic field
configuration is very similar to

197
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:27,844
that of an electric dipole.
I can show you that in the

198
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:30,465
following way.
Let's first look at the

199
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:33,087
electric dipole that you see up
there.

200
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:36,772
This is a positive charge,
this is a negative charge.

201
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:39,322
Don't look anywhere near the
charges.

202
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:41,661
Don't look in between the
charges.

203
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:44,566
Look far away.
Here you see electric field

204
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:48,605
lines and you see them here.
Now look at your current loop

205
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:51,014
here.
The current is going into the

206
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:53,494
paper here, coming out of the
paper.

207
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:57,957
There is a loop.
And look, you see the same

208
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:59,868
configuration,
field lines,

209
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:02,073
field lines.
This goes like so.

210
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:05,895
This one goes like so.
Here, the electric field lines

211
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:09,203
coming in, magnetic field lines
are coming in.

212
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,702
Electric field lines are going
out.

213
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,2
Magnetic field lines are going
out.

214
00:15:14,2 --> 00:15:18,022
They look very similar.
Gauss's Law tells me that the

215
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:22,212
closed surface integral of the
electric flux is the charge

216
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,005
inside the box divided by
epsilon zero,

217
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:28,974
and so if you have a closed
surface

218
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:33,075
here, it looks like a line but
I meant it to be a surface,

219
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:37,104
then that closed surface
integral of the electric flux is

220
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,558
now zero because there's a
charge inside the box.

221
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:45,019
No matter where in the magnetic
field you make a closed surface

222
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:49,264
there is never any magnetic flux
going through that surface.

223
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:53,437
Never, unless you come into
twenty-six one hundred and show

224
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:56,747
me a magnetic monopole.
Only then will there be

225
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:01,889
magnetic
flux coming out of a closed

226
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:07,959
surface, if we put the magnetic
monopole inside.

227
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,77
And this, now,
brings us to the second of four

228
00:16:13,77 --> 00:16:19,84
Maxwell's equations,
the first one being Gauss's

229
00:16:19,84 --> 00:16:27,719
Law, the second one is that the
closed surface- closed surface

230
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:35,338
integral of B dot DA  is always
zero, unless you come with a

231
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:39,883
magnetic
monopole.

232
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:45,526
So we now have two of
Maxwell's four equations in

233
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,759
place.
Historic day.

234
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:55,047
I want to show you the magnetic
field in the vicinity of a wire

235
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,396
like this.
I have to use a few hundred

236
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:04,215
amperes through that wire.
I told you why,

237
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:10,327
because magnetic field falls
off

238
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:13,842
quite rapidly,
and I do that with iron file

239
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:19,031
which I will sprinkle around the
wire and these magnetites will

240
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:23,633
orient themselves in that
magnetic field and then I will

241
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:28,487
try to also make you see this
field configuration by having

242
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:33,591
one wire going into the paper
and one coming out of the paper.

243
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:37,441
So let's first look at the
single current wire.

244
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:41,458
It's coming towards you and it
goes

245
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,37
into of course.
It is a wire that goes like

246
00:17:44,37 --> 00:17:48,669
this and the reason why you see
it here is of course we have to

247
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:52,482
get the current in somehow.
But it really is a wire like

248
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:55,603
this, and this platform I'm
going to show you.

249
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:58,584
I'm going to put some iron file
around this.

250
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:02,329
We've got magnetites and when
they see magnetic fields,

251
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:06,004
they will try to orient
themselves in the direction of

252
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:09,332
the magnetic fields,
so you're going to see these

253
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,828
circles.
But appreciate the fact that

254
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:17,46
you need huge currents for this.
Hundreds of amperes we do.

255
00:18:17,46 --> 00:18:21,087
That's why we have car battery
here, remember,

256
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:25,52
that was capable of delivering
many hundreds of amperes.

257
00:18:25,52 --> 00:18:29,227
So I close the current now.
I tap, you can see,

258
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:33,579
these circular configurations.
I hope you can see that.

259
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,206
Looks like circles.
I want to do the same now.

260
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:40,672
This is a little bit more
exciting, perhaps,

261
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:45,669
with one wire going into the
plane and the other

262
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:49,357
one coming out.
Even though it's not a circle,

263
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:53,865
the idea is that you get a
field configuration very much

264
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:57,226
like you see there.
Boy, it's already hot.

265
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:02,144
These cables are already hot.
They don't like the two hundred

266
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,849
amperes.
OK, let's do it this way.

267
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:09,85
So you're going to see a field
configuration similar to what I

268
00:19:09,85 --> 00:19:15,342
have on the blackboard,
similar to what you have here.

269
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:19,998
Oh, not, not this one.
Similar to this.

270
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:25,021
Yeah, actually,
it was also the one that I

271
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:30,045
have, but this is nicer way to
look at it.

272
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:37,152
So we have one wire going in
and one wire coming out of the

273
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:41,563
plane.
All right, so  let's first put

274
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:48,303
some iron file on.
All right,

275
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:52,382
and now a few hundred amperes
through it, tap it,

276
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:57,057
and you can see close to the
wire that goes in  here and

277
00:19:57,057 --> 00:20:00,966
here, you see circles.
Those are the one over R

278
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,281
relationship.
They dominate the magnetic

279
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:07,001
fields, but look in between
here.

280
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:11,165
With a little bit of
imagination you can see these

281
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:16,01
field lines going like this,
just like I have today on the

282
00:20:16,01 --> 00:20:19,75
blackboard.
All right.

283
00:20:19,75 --> 00:20:24,702
We don't need it anymore,
and we don't need that anymore.

284
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:29,832
So this gives you a little bit
of insight into the magnetic

285
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:34,961
field configurations that we
have about these wires when we

286
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:39,118
run a current through.
I will return to magnetic

287
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:43,01
fields next lecture and we will
expand on it.

288
00:20:43,01 --> 00:20:48,051
We will learn techniques to
calculate magnetic fields in a

289
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:53,623
way which is highly superior to
Biot-Savart's law.

290
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:58,01
In fact, that wil get us to the
third Maxwell equation,

291
00:20:58,01 --> 00:21:00,934
almost.
But I now want you to relax a

292
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:05,728
little bit because this may
already have been a little rough

293
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:10,684
on you, so now I want to discuss
something entirely different,

294
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:14,746
something very practical,
and it has to do with the

295
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:19,377
transport of electrical energy.
So we have a power station

296
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:23,358
somewhere at location A,
and they deliver electric

297
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:27,258
power, electric energy to
Boston.

298
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:29,38
Here is Boston,
location B.

299
00:21:29,38 --> 00:21:32,809
And A is the location of the
power station.

300
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,402
This could be a thousand miles,
the distance.

301
00:21:36,402 --> 00:21:40,484
There's a cable going from the
power station to us,

302
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:44,239
and the potential here in this
line, say, is B,

303
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:47,424
a field B.
Here's a cable for the return

304
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:51,751
current, so the current goes
like this, and the return

305
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:56,241
current is in this direction,
and, and here you use this

306
00:21:56,241 --> 00:22:01,054
energy.
You hook up your computer,

307
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:05,443
you hook up your hairdryer,
your heaters,

308
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:11,369
electric toothbrush and what
have you, your TV station,

309
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:15,54
everything.
And so you are the consumer

310
00:22:15,54 --> 00:22:19,051
here.
You take the energy that is

311
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:25,526
provided by this power station.
I will call the potential of

312
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:33,866
this line zero and so this is V
of A higher than this line here.

313
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:40,586
Well, according to Ohm's Law,
VA minus VB is the current

314
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:48,161
times capital R which is now not
radius, but that is resistance

315
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:54,392
in the wire, this wire.
This cable, however thick it

316
00:22:54,392 --> 00:23:00,989
may be, has a finite resistance.
And so VB, that is the

317
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:06,104
potential that we
receive in Boston,

318
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:11,38
equals VA minus IR.
So if there's no current going

319
00:23:11,38 --> 00:23:16,226
through the wire,
no one is using any electric

320
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:19,779
energy, then VB is the same as
VA.

321
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:23,979
Now I want to know if we
consume energy,

322
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:30,117
so we're dealing now with
power, so the power that we take

323
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:38,37
off at Boston is I times V of B.
That's the number of joules per

324
00:23:38,37 --> 00:23:45,061
second that we are consuming.
So that then equals VA times I

325
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:48,35
minus I square R.
That's fine.

326
00:23:48,35 --> 00:23:53,113
What is this?
This is the energy per second

327
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:57,082
that we are consuming.
What is this?

328
00:23:57,082 --> 00:24:03,206
This is the energy per second
that the power station is

329
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:07,749
delivering to us.
What is this?

330
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:12,573
That's lost energy.
It's the I square R that is the

331
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:17,88
heat produced in this cable that
goes into the universe.

332
00:24:17,88 --> 00:24:21,739
It's gone.
So the economy demands that we

333
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:25,309
try to make this as small as
possible.

334
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:31,099
Uh, this is the power that is
available but you get a loss of

335
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:35,344
power in terms of heats,
the minus sign here,

336
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:42,377
so you get less  in Boston.
And so how can you make this I

337
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:45,898
square R low?
Well, what is the resistance of

338
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:49,42
a wire that is rho,
which is the resistivity,

339
00:24:49,42 --> 00:24:54,142
times the length of the wire
divided by the cross-section of

340
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:57,023
the wire.
So we have several options.

341
00:24:57,023 --> 00:25:01,265
You could make A very large,
a very thick copper wire,

342
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:05,267
and that's expensive.
You could also make the wires

343
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:10,789
out of gold, which has a lower
resistivity than copper.

344
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:15,545
That's also expensive.
People are thinking of making

345
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:20,393
these transmission wires of
superconducting material.

346
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:24,776
They have to cool them at very
low temperatures.

347
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:30,277
That's outrageously expensive
but that's a way you could get

348
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:34,939
the resistance down.
Let's now look at the current.

349
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:37,83
What can we do with the
current?

350
00:25:37,83 --> 00:25:42,788
Suppose we consume a hundred
megawatts.

351
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:49,145
Not an unreasonable number,
so we are consuming a hundred

352
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:54,594
megawatts, and just for the sake
of the argument,

353
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:59,589
suppose at VB the potential is
hundred volts,

354
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:05,606
so V of B is a hundred volts.
What now is the current?

355
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:10,601
Well, current times potential
gives me power,

356
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:16,845
and so my current is now a
million amperes.

357
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:21,09
Alternatively,
suppose that the potential at B

358
00:26:21,09 --> 00:26:24,769
in the wire is a hundred
thousand volts,

359
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:29,391
a thousand times higher.
Now the current is only a

360
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:33,259
thousand amperes,
gives me the same power.

361
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,315
In both cases,
am I consuming at a rate of a

362
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:40,429
hundred million joules per
second.

363
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:44,579
But I square R,
the heat loss on the way from

364
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:50,265
the power station to me,
is a million times lower in

365
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:54,501
this case than in that case,
because I is a thousand times

366
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:57,771
lower, and the heat loss goes
with I squared,

367
00:26:57,771 --> 00:27:01,635
and so now you understand why
electricity, when it is

368
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:06,168
transported from one place to
another, why this is done at the

369
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:09,735
highest voltage possible.
When you get to Boston,

370
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:13,823
you've obviously got to do
something about this enormous

371
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:18,058
potential, because if you were
to deliver a

372
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:20,841
hundred thousand potential
difference there,

373
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:24,658
then half the population in
Boston would electrocute itself,

374
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:28,475
so now you've got to come down
in voltage, which you do with

375
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:31,192
transformers.
We will talk about that later

376
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,974
in the course.
And so you bring it down to a

377
00:27:33,974 --> 00:27:37,145
comfortable voltage,
which is in the United States

378
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:40,768
about a hundred and ten volts.
In Europe it's two twenty.

379
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:44,132
Now comes the question,
how high can you make V of A.

380
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:47,82
The higher you could make it,
the less loss there would be

381
00:27:47,82 --> 00:27:49,96
along
the way.

382
00:27:49,96 --> 00:27:54,076
Well, you've got to stay away
from the breakdown electric

383
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:57,677
field, which is the three
million volts per meter.

384
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:01,646
If at the surface of these
cables you get three million

385
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,659
volts per meter,
you get corona discharge.

386
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:08,555
That's a big loss and you want
to stay away from that,

387
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:11,715
and so typical cables have
about a radius R.

388
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:14,875
This is now,
R is the radius of the cable of

389
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:19,285
about two centimeters that gives
him a cross-sectional area I

390
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:24,449
think of
about ten to the minus three

391
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:27,306
meters squared,
that's correct.

392
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:32,923
And the potential V at A is
roughly three hundred kilovolts,

393
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:38,351
and with that configuration you
stay comfortably below the

394
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:42,826
electric field of three million
volts per meter,

395
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:46,444
but you don't get the corona
discharge.

396
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:51,966
If the length of that cable,
L, if that were something like

397
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:57,816
thousand kilometers,
not an unreasonable number,

398
00:28:57,816 --> 00:29:03,332
thousand kilometer distance
from if we get our electricity

399
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:08,752
from Niagara Falls to Boston,
not an unreasonable number,

400
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:14,558
you can calculate now what the
resistance of that cable would

401
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:20,461
be, because that resistance R
equals rho times L divided by A.

402
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:25,106
If you take copper,
that has a resistivity of two

403
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:29,944
times ten to the minus eight SI
units.

404
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:35,698
We have a length of ten to the
sixth meters of the cable and we

405
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:41,172
have a cross-sectional area of
ten to the minus three square

406
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:46,183
meters so that thousand
kilometer cable would only have

407
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:51,101
a resistance of twenty ohms.
And to make the numbers a

408
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:56,019
little easy, if we have a
current say of three hundred

409
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,566
amperes, then the power that the
power

410
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:05,627
station produces,
if you take the three hundred

411
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:10,798
kilovolts for now,
that power would be the three

412
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:17,069
hundred kilovolts times the
three hundred amperes and that

413
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:23,34
is about ninety megawatts.
That's close to my hundred that

414
00:30:23,34 --> 00:30:28,951
I had in mind earlier.
So you can calculate now what

415
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:34,232
the loss is.
The loss is I squared R.

416
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:38,33
You know R is twenty ohms,
you know I, three hundred

417
00:30:38,33 --> 00:30:43,393
amperes, and so you'll find now
that you have about two megawatt

418
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45
loss.
That's not bad.

419
00:30:45 --> 00:30:48,696
Two out of ninety.
So we have about two percent

420
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:53,597
energy loss in transportation.
You can also calculate now what

421
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:58,338
the difference is in potential
between the power station and

422
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:02,356
Boston, VA minus VB is IR.
You know that I is three

423
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:06,615
hundred amperes and you know
that R is

424
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:10,312
twenty ohms,
so VA minus VB  is about six

425
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:12,623
kilovolts.
In other words,

426
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:17,8
if the power station puts it on
the line at three hundred

427
00:31:17,8 --> 00:31:22,884
kilovolts, then you would get it
here with only four six

428
00:31:22,884 --> 00:31:27,136
kilovolts less.
So it's not a very unreasonable

429
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:30,556
situation.
I told you that these power

430
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:36,657
lines have to stay away from the
three

431
00:31:36,657 --> 00:31:40,435
million volts per meter
electric field because then you

432
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:44,492
get corona discharge and when
there is thunderstorms in the

433
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:48,828
area it can actually push up the
electric field on the wire and

434
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:53,025
you can get corona discharge.
I have seen that several times,

435
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:57,012
not only seen it at night,
with my naked eyes that you see

436
00:31:57,012 --> 00:32:00,09
the power lines glow,
but I've also heard it,

437
00:32:00,09 --> 00:32:03,518
because you can here this
cracking noise of corona

438
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:05,756
discharge.
It's very fascinating,

439
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:08,973
actually.
I have a slide here

440
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:12,787
which shows that.
So here you see a high voltage

441
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:17,735
power line, transmission line,
and you clearly see the glowing

442
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:22,035
of the corona discharge.
They compare that with what's

443
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,631
called a [inaudible] kite
string.

444
00:32:24,631 --> 00:32:29,58
Kite strings at night when you
fly them near thunderstorms can

445
00:32:29,58 --> 00:32:32,744
also produce corona discharge
and light.

446
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:36,882
That's why the call [inaudible]
kite string candles.

447
00:32:36,882 --> 00:32:41,019
Benjamin Franklin did quite a
bit of

448
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:47,155
experiments at night with,
uh, kites near thunderstorms.

449
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:52,843
Dangerous business by the way.
So you see that these

450
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:58,978
high-voltage power lines can go
into a corona discharge.

451
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:02,994
I now want to revisit our
Leyden jar.

452
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:09,575
We had a truly absurd situation
whereby we did an experiment

453
00:33:09,575 --> 00:33:13,87
with a
jar which you still see here,

454
00:33:13,87 --> 00:33:16,599
and I will redo the
demonstration,

455
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:20,818
but it's crying for an
explanation because it looked

456
00:33:20,818 --> 00:33:24,374
like there was something wrong
with physics,

457
00:33:24,374 --> 00:33:28,758
and I want to refresh your
memory of what we have seen

458
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:32,397
before and what this Leyden jar
is all about.

459
00:33:32,397 --> 00:33:37,608
The Leyden jar is nothing but a
capacitor, which is a dielectric

460
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:41,661
between two conductors in the
form,

461
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:46,128
in the shape of a- of a bottle,
the jar.

462
00:33:46,128 --> 00:33:50,711
And so the inner portion,
which is glass,

463
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:54,835
say has this shape.
You see it there,

464
00:33:54,835 --> 00:34:01,021
you're going to see it shortly
there, and then  we have

465
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:06,52
conductors, the conducting
beaker around it here,

466
00:34:06,52 --> 00:34:14,513
and we have a conducting
beaker on the inside.

467
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:18,935
And we charge these up with the
Wimshurst.

468
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:24,327
This is the Wimshurst machine.
And when we do that,

469
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:30,366
we get free charge on the
conductor, and so you get sigma

470
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:37,052
free  right here and you get it
here, opposite signs of course,

471
00:34:37,052 --> 00:34:41,689
and you get sigma induced on
the dielectric.

472
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:48,315
Why do you get it?
Because the dielectric sees an

473
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:53,848
external field due to this sigma
free, so it begins to polarize,

474
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:59,03
and so you get here induced
charge and you get there induced

475
00:34:59,03 --> 00:35:01,841
charge.
If this side is positive,

476
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:05,793
then the induced charge here
will be negative,

477
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:09,482
and vice-versa.
We have here  a metal hook,

478
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,083
so that we can lift out the
inner portion.

479
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:19,167
And so what we did,
we charged it up with the

480
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:23,276
Wimshurst, and then there is a
certain amount of energy.

481
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:27,609
The electrostatic potential
energy of this configuration is

482
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:31,045
one-half Q free times the
potential difference,

483
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:35,528
and the Q free is the charge
which is on the outer conductor.

484
00:35:35,528 --> 00:35:38,666
And what I then did,
I disassembled it very

485
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:43,073
carefully after we had charged
it up, took the inner portion

486
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:47,331
out, took the glass out,
the outer portion,

487
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:50,534
and I took all the free charge
off.

488
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:54,679
I touched the conductors and
discharged them,

489
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,164
so there is no Q free left.
It's gone.

490
00:35:58,164 --> 00:36:03,816
The moment that that is gone,
the induced charge must also go

491
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:09,374
away because the induced charge
is only there because of the

492
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:13,048
free charge.
Remember the induced charge

493
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:17,946
density is one minus one over
kappa times sigma free.

494
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:22,373
So if glass has a kappa of
five,

495
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:26,73
then the induced surface charge
density is about oh point eight

496
00:36:26,73 --> 00:36:29,329
times the free surface charge
density.

497
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:33,194
The moment that the free one
goes, the induced one goes.

498
00:36:33,194 --> 00:36:37,48
And then I assembled it again,
and much to our surprise when I

499
00:36:37,48 --> 00:36:40,993
short out the inner portion with
the outer portion,

500
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:44,295
we saw a huge spark.
That means there was energy

501
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:48,37
left and that is very puzzling.
There can not be any energy

502
00:36:48,37 --> 00:36:52,938
left unless there is something
wrong with physics.

503
00:36:52,938 --> 00:37:00,053
So I first want to show that
again, to remind you of what you

504
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:05,745
have seen before,
and then I will make a proposal

505
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:11,792
for a- for an explanation.
Let me check my- my light

506
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:17,01
configuration.
Ah, we're going to make it all

507
00:37:17,01 --> 00:37:21,279
dark.
I can charge it up while you're

508
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:24,244
seeing it, actually.
Yeah.

509
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,615

510
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:35,195
Make it dark now.
And now I will disassemble it.

511
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:45,965
I take the inner portion out.
The glass is a good insulator,

512
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:56,188
so I don't mind touching that
with my hand.

513
00:37:56,188 --> 00:38:00,919
OK, and so now I take the inner
conductor, touch it,

514
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:04,722
lick it, kiss it,
take all the charge off.

515
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:08,247
There it is.
Do the same with the outer

516
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:13,627
conductor, have it in my hand.
For sure, there is no Q free

517
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:16,596
left on anymore,
on that anymore.

518
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:21,605
I put the glass back in again,
and then I put the inner

519
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:27,356
[inaudible], and now I'll make
it a little darker

520
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:31,326
for you because I want you to
see that when I short this out

521
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:35,161
that you're going to see a
spark, so I'm going to turn the

522
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:37,382
lights down, so look very
closely.

523
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:40,409
I'm going to tell you when I'm
going to do it.

524
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:43,033
Three, two, one,
I'm approaching it now,

525
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:45,052
zero.
And there's a huge spark.

526
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:47,407
That means energy,
and that's crazy.

527
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:50,838
There shouldn't be any.
And so some of you must have

528
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:54,269
had sleepless nights not being
able to explain this.

529
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:58,844
Some of uh- some of you
actually wrote me e-mail.

530
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:03,898
Uh, you didn't have sleepless
nights, I can tell that.

531
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:08,378
So what's going on?
There's only one possibility

532
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:13,145
and that is there must be free
charge on the glass.

533
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:17,34
How did it get there?
Well, corona discharge.

534
00:39:17,34 --> 00:39:20,773
That's the only way it can get
there.

535
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:24,872
Keep in mind that the electric
field in air,

536
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:30,688
in air, can be no larger than
three times ten to the six volts

537
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:34,735
per meter.
If it gets larger,

538
00:39:34,735 --> 00:39:38,987
you get corona discharge.
In glass, by the way,

539
00:39:38,987 --> 00:39:43,332
it's a bit higher.
It's ten to the seventh volts

540
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:46,105
per meter.
I will now make some

541
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:49,895
calculations based on certain
assumptions.

542
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:55,256
And those assumptions may not
be exactly accurate because I

543
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:59,508
don't know the exact dimensions
of this system,

544
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:04,072
but the exact dimensions
don't matter.

545
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:08,682
What matters is the idea behind
it, why it does such crazy

546
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:10,542
things.
So first of all,

547
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,828
I will assume that this
capacitor is just two parallel

548
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:18,305
plain plates.
That's a simplifying situation

549
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:21,217
because it has the shape of a
bottle.

550
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:25,503
I will assume that the
Wimshurst produces about thirty

551
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:28,738
kilovolts.
I know that it's approximately

552
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:31,326
right, but it may be
twenty-five.

553
00:40:31,326 --> 00:40:37,753
It may be thirty-five.
I will assume that the air gap

554
00:40:37,753 --> 00:40:44,031
between the outer conductor and
the glass is one millimeter,

555
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:49,989
that both are one millimeter,
and I would assume that the

556
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:55,629
glass thickness is three
millimeters, and I take kappa

557
00:40:55,629 --> 00:41:01,055
equal five for the glass.
So that is the basis of my

558
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:04,78
calculations.
So now I have here the

559
00:41:04,78 --> 00:41:09,983
conductor on the outside.
This is the glass,

560
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:13,78
and this is the conductor on
the inside, so this is one

561
00:41:13,78 --> 00:41:17,016
millimeter thick.
This is the glass and this is

562
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,744
the conductor on the inside,
so this is one millimeter

563
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:24,541
thick, this is three millimeters
thick, and this is one

564
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:27,706
millimeter thick,
and the potential difference

565
00:41:27,706 --> 00:41:31,364
over the whole thing is going to
be thirty kilovolts.

566
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:35,584
But I know that the potential
difference is always E times D.

567
00:41:35,584 --> 00:41:40,155
That holds for this gap the
local E times this D,

568
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:44,766
the local E times this D,
and the local E times that D.

569
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:50,059
I also know that E glass is the
same as E in the air divided by

570
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:54,413
that kappa, which is five.
And I know that the total

571
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:59,193
potential difference between
here and here must be thirty

572
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:02,864
thousand volts.
And so this allows me now to

573
00:42:02,864 --> 00:42:07,218
calculate in a very
straightforward way the electric

574
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:11,829
field here in the air,
the electric field

575
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,91
here in the air,
and the electric field in the

576
00:42:15,91 --> 00:42:20,899
glass because I get simple
equation with one unknown and

577
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:25,616
that's the following.
I first go over this gap and so

578
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:30,333
I get E in the air times the
distance D, which is one

579
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:33,961
millimeter.
But of course later on I have

580
00:42:33,961 --> 00:42:39,313
to go through this gap again so
I'll multiply it by two now.

581
00:42:39,313 --> 00:42:43,577
And now I have to add the
electric

582
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:47,087
field in the glass,
which is the same as air

583
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:50,597
divided by five,
times its distance which is

584
00:42:50,597 --> 00:42:54,271
three millimeters,
and that must now be thirty

585
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:58,843
thousand, because that's the
potential difference between

586
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:02,353
here and there.
That's one equation with one

587
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:04,884
unknown.
And I can calculate the

588
00:43:04,884 --> 00:43:09,7
electric field in the air gap.
And the electric field in the

589
00:43:09,7 --> 00:43:16,639
air gap turns out to be eleven
point five times  ten to the six

590
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,479
volts per meter.
It's here the same,

591
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:23,616
of course, eleven point five
times ten to the sixth,

592
00:43:23,616 --> 00:43:27,834
and here it is five times
smaller, so I find here two

593
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:30,592
point three times ten to the
sixth.

594
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:34,162
To show you that I did my
homework correctly,

595
00:43:34,162 --> 00:43:38,461
the potential difference here
is now eleven point five

596
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:41,463
kilovolts.
I put it here in kilovolts.

597
00:43:41,463 --> 00:43:46,411
The potential difference here
is now about seven kilovolts and

598
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:50,367
the
potential difference here is

599
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:53,701
the same, is eleven point five
kilovolts.

600
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:56,868
And if you add them up,
you get thirty.

601
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:59,869
If you look at this,
this can not be,

602
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:04,953
because a field of eleven point
five times ten to the sixth is

603
00:44:04,953 --> 00:44:08,12
way above the breakdown electric
field.

604
00:44:08,12 --> 00:44:12,455
And so what are you going to-
what's going to happen,

605
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:17,205
you're going to get corona
discharge from the conductor to

606
00:44:17,205 --> 00:44:21,099
the glass,
and so what you're doing is

607
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,998
you're spraying charge on the
glass, and that's the key to the

608
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:27,108
solution of this bizarre
behavior.

609
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:30,432
And so when you later
disassemble it and you take the

610
00:44:30,432 --> 00:44:34,332
free charge of the conductors.
There is still this free charge

611
00:44:34,332 --> 00:44:36,57
which you have sprayed on the
glass.

612
00:44:36,57 --> 00:44:39,383
I never remove that.
It's very hard to remove

613
00:44:39,383 --> 00:44:41,492
because the glass is an
insulator.

614
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:44,753
It's very difficult to take
charge off an insulator.

615
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:48,269
It's easy to take it off a
conductor but I've never even

616
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:52,233
attempted that because I made
you believe,

617
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:58,085
as I believed myself for years,
that once you take the Q free

618
00:44:58,085 --> 00:45:03,645
of the conductor that there can
be no charge on the glass.

619
00:45:03,645 --> 00:45:07,156
That is wrong,
because there's corona

620
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:10,668
discharge.
So now comes the question,

621
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:15,642
before we disassemble,
what now is the configuration

622
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:19,641
of the electric fields and the
potentials.

623
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:27,054
I'll make a drawing here and so
now I draw again the conductor,

624
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:31,252
the glass, and the conductor.
I resume now that after the

625
00:45:31,252 --> 00:45:36,049
corona discharge this field here
is three times ten to the sixth.

626
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:39,872
Maybe a little lower,
but that's the maximum that it

627
00:45:39,872 --> 00:45:44,669
can be, and so the field here in
the air will be also three times

628
00:45:44,669 --> 00:45:47,068
ten to the sixth volts per
meter.

629
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:51,04
But since I know that the
potential difference between

630
00:45:51,04 --> 00:45:55,537
here and here must be thirty
kilovolts, I can now immediately

631
00:45:55,537 --> 00:46:00,409
conclude that the electric field
here is now eight

632
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:03,228
times ten to the sixth volts
per meter.

633
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:07,381
That is the only way that it
adds up to thirty kilovolts,

634
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:11,83
because the three million volts
per meter gives me here three

635
00:46:11,83 --> 00:46:14,352
kilovolts.
This here gives me three

636
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:16,948
kilovolts.
So now I need a potential

637
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:21,397
difference here of twenty-four
kilovolts, and that over three

638
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:25,847
millimeters requires this field.
Look, this field is stronger

639
00:46:25,847 --> 00:46:30,222
than that field,
whereas earlier we made the

640
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:34,407
assumption that this field was
five times lower than that

641
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,798
field.
Yah, why is it now higher?

642
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:40,534
Because we have sprayed right
here on this surface,

643
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:44,793
we have sprayed free charge.
It's no longer the field that

644
00:46:44,793 --> 00:46:48,753
is dictated by the external
field and then the induced

645
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:51,293
charges.
That's no longer the case.

646
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:53,759
It carries now itself free
charge.

647
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:57,42
You now have all the tools,
maybe not the courage,

648
00:46:57,42 --> 00:47:02,277
to calculate how much free
charge there is right

649
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,312
here on the glass to get these
fields.

650
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:08,512
It's a very straightforward
calculation.

651
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:13,435
And you will find that there is
twelve times more free charge

652
00:47:13,435 --> 00:47:17,783
here on the glass than there is
here on the conductor,

653
00:47:17,783 --> 00:47:21,475
twelve times more,
and so if I disassemble and

654
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:26,316
remove the free charge on the
conductors, I have almost done

655
00:47:26,316 --> 00:47:30,828
nothing because most of the free
charge is on the glass,

656
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:35,094
and I have not touched that.
So now, if I reassemble,

657
00:47:35,094 --> 00:47:40,515
I have almost all energy left.
I have not lost much.

658
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:44,538
Lost some, but not lost much.
And so what I should have

659
00:47:44,538 --> 00:47:47,965
really have done,
I should also have discharged

660
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,349
the inner glass.
That's not easy,

661
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:54,596
but I will try that today.
It's not easy because it's very

662
00:47:54,596 --> 00:47:58,247
hard to take that charge off,
but I will try that.

663
00:47:58,247 --> 00:48:01,897
And then there shouldn't be
much energy left if we

664
00:48:01,897 --> 00:48:05,771
reassemble it again and try to
get a spark out of it.

665
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:09,646
So I go through the same
routine and

666
00:48:09,646 --> 00:48:15,899
I'm going to charge it up now.
OK, take this cable off,

667
00:48:15,899 --> 00:48:20,069
take that cable off.
I take it apart,

668
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:25,164
do everything that I did before
the same way,

669
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:30,144
gone, whole charge gone,
whatever there was.

670
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:35,472
Whole charge gone.
Now, this is more difficult.

671
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:42,304
This is not enough if I do
this.

672
00:48:42,304 --> 00:48:46,152
I have to get in there.
Ooh, I could actually feel it.

673
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:48,548
It's really,
it's a great feeling.

674
00:48:48,548 --> 00:48:52,687
I can feel a sort of corona
discharge with my -- I have to

675
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:55,954
really get everything out and
that's not easy.

676
00:48:55,954 --> 00:48:58,785
It's not.
In fact, when I rub in with my

677
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:03,359
shirt, I may even make it worse.
I may be charging it up through

678
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,973
friction.
But I'll do the best I can.

679
00:49:05,973 --> 00:49:08,441
It's very indecent,
what I'm doing.

680
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:12,072
OK.
So I try to get a charge now,

681
00:49:12,072 --> 00:49:15,567
something that we ignored
completely before.

682
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:20,688
This is really where the energy
was, and I'm trying to kill that

683
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:24,102
now, and so now I'm going to
reassemble it,

684
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:28,329
and I'll go through the same
routine [clink] [whoop].

685
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:32,394
Good thing I didn't break it.
Put it back in again.

686
00:49:32,394 --> 00:49:36,295
I'll make it dark,
so that you can see where the-

687
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:39,71
perhaps there may be a little
bit of spark,

688
00:49:39,71 --> 00:49:45,887
if I didn't succeed to remove
all the charges from the glass.

689
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:49,224
So I'm going to short it out
again, three,

690
00:49:49,224 --> 00:49:52,887
two, one, zero,
and I saw a teeny-weeny little

691
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:55,817
spark.
You may not even have seen it,

692
00:49:55,817 --> 00:50:00,862
so we have to conclude now that
the physics behind this lies in

693
00:50:00,862 --> 00:50:05,99
the glass and physics works even
when it sometimes surprises us.

694
00:50:05,99 --> 50:11
See you Wednesday.
