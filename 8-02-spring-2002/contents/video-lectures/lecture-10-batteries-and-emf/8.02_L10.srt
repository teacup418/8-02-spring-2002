1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,424



2
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:04,332
We have often talked about
power supplies,

3
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:09,288
which are devices which
maintain a constant potential

4
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:12,815
difference.
Here, we have such a power

5
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:17,867
supply, potential difference V,
this be the plus side,

6
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:22,92
and this be the minus side.
I'm going to connect this,

7
00:00:22,92 --> 00:00:27,686
I have a resistor here,
R, and as a result of this,

8
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:31,88
current will start to flow in
this direction,

9
00:00:31,88 --> 00:00:35,892
this direction,
this direction,

10
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:39,579
so in the power supply,
the current flows in this

11
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,19
directions.
Through the resistance,

12
00:00:42,19 --> 00:00:44,879
the current flows in this
direction.

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,875
In what direction is the
electric field?

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:52,407
The electric field always runs
from plus to minus potential.

15
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:54,788
So right here,
in this resistor,

16
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:59,32
the electric field is in this
direction, from plus to minus.

17
00:00:59,32 --> 00:01:04,927
But inside the supply it must
also go from plus to minus.

18
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:09,677
And so inside the supply,
the electric field is in the

19
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:12,724
direction that opposes the
current.

20
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:17,563
So some kind of a pump
mechanism must force the current

21
00:01:17,563 --> 00:01:22,133
to go inside the supply,
against the electric field.

22
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:25,09
A boulder does not,
all by itself,

23
00:01:25,09 --> 00:01:29,033
move up a hill.
And so something is needed to

24
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:30,915
push it.
You remember,

25
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:36,117
with the VandeGraaff,
we were spraying charge onto a

26
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:39,938
belt, and then we rotated the
belt, and the belt forces the

27
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:42,77
charge into the dome.
It had to overcome the

28
00:01:42,77 --> 00:01:46,13
repelling force of the dome.
So work had to be done.

29
00:01:46,13 --> 00:01:48,634
So the energy must come from
somewhere.

30
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:52,125
And in the case of the
VandeGraaff, it was clearly the

31
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,233
motor that kept the belt
running.

32
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:58,054
In the case of the Wimshurst it
was I who turned the crank,

33
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:00,36
so I did work.
In the case of common

34
00:02:00,36 --> 00:02:03,324
batteries, the ones that you buy
in the store,

35
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:06,947
it is chemical energy that
provides

36
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:12,201
the energy.
And I will discuss now with you

37
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:18,705
and demonstrate a particular
kind of chemical energy,

38
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:25,959
which is one whereby we have a
zinc and a copper plate in a

39
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,086
solution.
So we have here,

40
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:32,713
H two S O 4,
and we have here,

41
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:39,592
zinc plate, and we have here a
copper plate.

42
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,228
This side will become positive,
and this side will become

43
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:46,96
negative.
You will get a potential

44
00:02:46,96 --> 00:02:49,858
difference between these two
plates.

45
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:53,914
To understand that really takes
quantum mechanics,

46
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:58,633
this goes beyond this course.
But the potential difference

47
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:02,772
that you get is normally
something around one volt.

48
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:06,415
The secret, really,
is not necessarily in the

49
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:10,389
solution, because if you take
two

50
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:15,491
conductors, two different
conductors, and you touch them,

51
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:19,591
metal on metal,
there will also be a potential

52
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:23,053
difference.
So let's look at his now in

53
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:27,244
some more detail.
We have here a porous barrier

54
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:32,346
that the ions can flow freely
from one side to the other.

55
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,808
I reconnect them here,
with a resistor,

56
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,633
and so a current is now
flowing.

57
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:44,226
A current is flowing in this
direction, through the

58
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:48,872
resistor, from the plus side of
the battery to the minus side,

59
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:53,214
that means inside the battery,
the current is flowing like

60
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:57,479
this, and the electric field,
here, is in this direction,

61
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,059
from plus to minus,
but also inside the battery,

62
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:04,486
the electric field must be from
plus to minus,

63
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:06,924
so you see again,
as we saw here,

64
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:11,341
that the electric field is in
the opposite direction of the

65
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:14,236
current.
You will have here S O 4 minus

66
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:18,939
ions,
and you have copper plus ions

67
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:23,824
in this solution,
and here you have zinc plus and

68
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:28,913
you have S O 4 minus.
And as current starts to run,

69
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:32,373
S O 4 minus ions,
which are now the

70
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:38,378
current-carrier inside this
battery, is going from the right

71
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,754
-- they're going from the right
to the left.

72
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:49,291
Now why would S O 4 minus ions
travel through an electric

73
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:53,641
field that opposes them?
That opposes their motion?

74
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,86
And they do that because,
in doing so,

75
00:04:56,86 --> 00:05:01,297
they engage in a chemical
reaction which yields more

76
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:05,387
energy than it costs to climb
the electric hill.

77
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:10,694
And while a current is flowing,
while the S O 4 minus is going

78
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:15,653
from the right to the left,
you get fewer S O 4 minus ions

79
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:19,267
here,
this liquid here remains

80
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:22,372
neutral, so copper plus must
disappear.

81
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,64
And it precipitates onto this
copper bar.

82
00:05:25,64 --> 00:05:29,071
So it is like copper-plating.
On this side,

83
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:33,809
you get an increase of S O 4
minus, therefore you also must

84
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:37,404
get an increase of zinc plus,
because, again,

85
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:41,734
this liquid there remains
neutral, and that means that

86
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:45,737
some of the zinc is being
dissolved, so you get an

87
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:50,177
increase in the
concentration of the zinc.

88
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:53,259
So the charge carriers inside
this battery,

89
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:56,855
the S O 4 minus ions,
travel through this barrier,

90
00:05:56,855 --> 00:06:00,891
and they go from here to here,
so they travel through an

91
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,826
electric field that opposes
their motion.

92
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:07,495
And this happens at the expense
of chemical energy.

93
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:11,091
Now, when the copper solution
becomes very dilute,

94
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:15,053
because all the copper has been
plated onto the copper,

95
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:18,723
and when this becomes
concentrated

96
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:22,531
zinc plus, then the battery
stops, and now what you can do,

97
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:25,617
you can run a current in the
opposite direction,

98
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:28,769
so you can run a current,
now, in this direction,

99
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:32,512
you can force a current to run
with another external power

100
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:35,862
supply, and now the chemical
reactions will reverse,

101
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,817
so now, copper will go back
into the solution,

102
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:41,706
so it will dissolve,
and now the zinc will be

103
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:45,514
precipitated onto the zinc,
and so now, if you do this long

104
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:50,472
enough, you can run the battery
again the way it is here.

105
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:53,722
A car battery is exactly this
kind of battery,

106
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:57,982
except that you have lead and
lead oxide instead of zinc and

107
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:00,799
copper, but you also have
sulfuric acid,

108
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:04,41
like you have here,
and a nickel-cadmium battery is

109
00:07:04,41 --> 00:07:08,743
well-known, you can charge that,
too, those are the ones that

110
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:12,498
are readily available in the
stores, you can run your

111
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,892
flashlights with these
nickel-cadmium batteries.

112
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:20,37
The symbol for battery that we
will be using in our circuits is

113
00:07:20,37 --> 00:07:25,259
this,
this is the positive side,

114
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,591
and this is the negative side,
this is a symbol that

115
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:38,419
symbolizes that we are dealing
with a -- with a battery.

116
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:44,254
So let this point be B,
and let this point be A,

117
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:51,456
and here, we have a resistor R.
So we have a current going,

118
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:58,531
the current is going in this
direction, a current I.

119
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:03,45
This could be a light bulb,
could be your laptop,

120
00:08:03,45 --> 00:08:08,471
could be a hair dryer,
whatever,  that you supply.

121
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:13,903
If this R is not there,
that means that the resistance

122
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:18,719
is infinitely large,
that means that the current

123
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:23,946
that is running zero,
then the voltage that we would

124
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:31,23
measure over this battery,
which is V B minus V A -- for

125
00:08:31,23 --> 00:08:36,297
which I will simply write down,
V of the battery -- that

126
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:40,72
voltage we call a curled E,
which stands for EMF,

127
00:08:40,72 --> 00:08:45,88
which is electromotive force.
I will show you that later.

128
00:08:45,88 --> 00:08:50,947
If I put a resistance R in
here, which is not infinitely

129
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,462
large, then a current will start
to flow, but now,

130
00:08:55,462 --> 00:09:00,253
we should never forget,
that between the points A and

131
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:04,081
B,
invisible to the human eye,

132
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:09,225
there is always an internal
resistance which I call little R

133
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:13,497
of I, and so if a current starts
to flow, it goes,

134
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:18,205
not only through capital R,
but it will also go through

135
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:22,128
this little R,
and so, according to Ohm's Law,

136
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:26,836
the EMF is now I times the
external resistance plus the

137
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:30,236
internal one.
The voltage that you would

138
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,805
measure
between point B and A is now

139
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:37,642
going to change.
That voltage,

140
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:42,63
according to Ohm's Law,
is I R, and so it's also the

141
00:09:42,63 --> 00:09:48,107
EMF minus I times R of I.
And you see it's a little lower

142
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:52,411
than the EMF.
And the reason is this internal

143
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:56,812
resistance here.
If I shorted out this battery

144
00:09:56,812 --> 00:10:02,974
-- stupid thing to do -- but if
I make R equal zero -- so I take

145
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:08,389
the battery and I just
short it out -- then,

146
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:13,889
the maximum current that I can
draw, then -- so R is now zero,

147
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:19,48
so you can see that the maximum
I that you can get is E divided

148
00:10:19,48 --> 00:10:23,988
by R of I -- and V of B,
the voltage that you would

149
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:28,226
measure now, between point B and
A goes to zero.

150
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:32,554
It doesn't mean that there is
no current running,

151
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:37,332
but it means that between these
points, your potential

152
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:41,156
difference
goes down to zero.

153
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:46,043
Shorting out a battery,
of course, is not a very smart

154
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:49,363
thing to do.
You can put batteries in

155
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:54,803
series, and thereby getting a
higher potential difference --

156
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:59,506
this is the negative side,
and this is the positive,

157
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:03,563
I have an independent one,
negative positive,

158
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:07,436
and an independent one,
negative, positive,

159
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:13,394
each one, with an EMF E,
and I can connect the positive

160
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:17,239
side of one with the negative
side of the other,

161
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:21,492
just a conducting wire,
and the positive side of this

162
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:26,155
with the negative side of the
other, and now the potential

163
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:30,246
difference between these two
points is now three E,

164
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:33,6
open circuit,
if I don't draw any current.

165
00:11:33,6 --> 00:11:36,545
If I draw a current,
then, of course,

166
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:40,062
I have to deal with the
internal resistance.

167
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:44,971
I'm going to build with you a
copper-zinc battery of the kind

168
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:49,212
that
we just discussed.

169
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:55,044
You see it here.
Here's the copper -- copper

170
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:59,52
sulfate solution,
which H 2 S O 4,

171
00:11:59,52 --> 00:12:05,624
and here are my plates,
this is my zinc plate,

172
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:13,219
and this is my copper plate,
and you are going to see the

173
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:19,865
voltage displayed,
I think, over there,

174
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:25,045
that is correct -- there's no
potential difference now,

175
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:30,512
because they're not in place
yet, and so here comes my  my

176
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:36,363
zinc, and here comes my copper,
and they go into the solution,

177
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:41,447
and you see about one volt.
In general these potential

178
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:45,283
difference are of that order of
one volt.

179
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:51,038
Oh point nine five.
So now what I will do,

180
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:57,396
I'm going to create a double
one, so I have two independent

181
00:12:57,396 --> 00:13:03,753
batteries, I have here  one
whereby I have copper and zinc,

182
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:09,562
and I have another one whereby
I have copper and zinc,

183
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:16,029
and I'm going to connect this
one, and you will see now that

184
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:24,688
the EMF will double.
If we're ready for that  --

185
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:27,862
this is my second one,
it's going to be completely

186
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:30,906
independent, so here comes the
other two plates,

187
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:34,598
make sure that I have the
copper and the zinc not confused

188
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:38,484
-- there we go -- and now you
should see twice the potential.

189
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,945
And you do see that.
It's open circuit,

190
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,443
there is no current running.
Well, there is a s- minute

191
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:48,264
little small current running
through the volt meter that you

192
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:50,531
see.
But that's so small that that's

193
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:54,093
-- can always be ignored.
And you see you get double the

194
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:57,487
EMF.
Now what I will do -- so I

195
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:01,222
have, now, about two volts
between these two plates,

196
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:05,176
two batteries in series,
I now have a little light bulb

197
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:08,472
here, and I'm going to turn on
the light bulb.

198
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:12,353
And now what you will see is
that the voltage that you

199
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:17,041
measure right here -- that's all
you can do, you can only measure

200
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:21,728
the voltage at the plates of the
battery -- that now this voltage

201
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:26,048
will drop, because of the
internal resistance

202
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:29,088
of the battery,
in addition you will see some

203
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:31,921
light, but that's really not my
objective.

204
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,546
For those of you who are
sitting close,

205
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:37,516
you can see this light bulb
going to be lit.

206
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:40,418
So I do this now,
I can see the light bulb,

207
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:43,803
a little bit of light,
and notice that the voltage

208
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:46,29
goes down.
And so this value that you

209
00:14:46,29 --> 00:14:49,813
measure now, V of B,
is now lower than the one point

210
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:53,889
nine volts because of this term.
You lose inside the battery

211
00:14:53,889 --> 00:15:00,873
through the internal resistance,
you lose there potential

212
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:03,9
difference.
All right?

213
00:15:03,9 --> 00:15:11,542
So let's take this out,
because this produces a lot of

214
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:15,146
a lot of smelly fumes.
OK.

215
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:21,202
That's fine.
If a charge moves from point A

216
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:27,113
to point B, and here the
potential is V A,

217
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:36,933
and here the potential is V B,
and a charge D Q moves -- and

218
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,545
let's suppose,
for simplicity,

219
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:44,589
that V B minus V A -- yes,
let's make the A larger than V

220
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,633
B, that's just a little bit
easier to think in that -- in

221
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,425
those terms.
It's not necessary,

222
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:56,028
of course.
So let's make V A large than V

223
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:59
B.
So the electric field is from A

224
00:15:59 --> 00:16:02,153
to B.
And I move charge from A to B,

225
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:07,017
then the electric field is
doing work.

226
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:11,057
And the work that the electric
field is doing,

227
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:15,457
D W, is the charge times the
potential difference,

228
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:19,857
which is V A minus V B.
This work can be positive,

229
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:24,436
if the charge is positive,
it can be negative if the

230
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:28,656
charge is negative,
because we have assumed that

231
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,35
this is positive,
in this case.

232
00:16:31,35 --> 00:16:36,289
I can now do something that you
shouldn't tell your math

233
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:41,017
teachers,
but physicists do it all the

234
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:44,51
time, we divide by D T,
and now we say,

235
00:16:44,51 --> 00:16:47,635
"Aha!
What we have on the left side

236
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:51,22
is now work per unit time.
That's power.

237
00:16:51,22 --> 00:16:55,08
Joules per second." So this,
now, is power.

238
00:16:55,08 --> 00:16:59,401
D Q D T is current,
how many Coulombs per second

239
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,607
flow.
So this is current,

240
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:04,456
I.
And the potential difference,

241
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:09,42
I simply call -- I use that
symbol, V.

242
00:17:09,42 --> 00:17:14,195
So you see down here that the
power delivered by a power

243
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:19,144
supply is the current that it
produces times the potential

244
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:22,356
difference.
And this is independent of

245
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:27,479
Ohm's Law, this always holds.
If you also include Ohm's Law,

246
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,862
if you can use it -- last time,
we discussed the limitations of

247
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:37,376
Ohm's Law -- but if you can use
it, and V equals I R,

248
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:43,457
then of course,
you can also write down for the

249
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:49,813
power, that it is I squared R,
and it is also V squared

250
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:54,522
divided by R.
Power is joules per second,

251
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:59,348
but we write,
for that, joules per second,

252
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:04,292
we write for that,
watts, just a capital W,

253
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:10,178
but it's named after the
physicist Watt.

254
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:14,785
So we always express the power
in terms of watts.

255
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:20,735
So suppose we have a resistance
R, and we run a current through

256
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:26,494
it -- this is the resistance --
e run a current I through it,

257
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:31,485
and let us take an example,
that the current I is one

258
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:36,284
ampere, and that the resistance
is one hundred ohm.

259
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:41,467
Then the power which is
dissipated in this resistor has

260
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:45,558
to be provided
by your battery,

261
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,027
that power P is now one hundred
watts.

262
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,308
I square R, if you want to use
this.

263
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:56,527
If it is two amperes,
and you don't change the

264
00:18:56,527 --> 00:19:00,839
resistance, then it becomes four
hundred watts.

265
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,057
Because it's I square R.
I doubles, the power,

266
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:09,932
and four times higher.
Now, this energy is dissipated

267
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:15,651
in the form of heat,
and if it gets hot enough,

268
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:20,493
then maybe you can produce
light, that's the idea behind a

269
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,551
light bulb.
The filament into -- in a

270
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:27,799
tungsten incandescent light bulb
becomes very high,

271
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,472
twenty five hundred degrees
Centigrade, maybe even three

272
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:36,89
thousand -- not so high,
of course, that the tungsten

273
00:19:36,89 --> 00:19:40,203
melts -- and so,
you begin to see light.

274
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:44,026
So, for instance,
a hundred watt light bulb --

275
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:49,293
oh, unintelligible work on here
-- so if we have a hundred watt

276
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:53,765
light
bulb in your dormitory,

277
00:19:53,765 --> 00:20:00,782
and the voltage is hundred ten
volts, you just plug it into the

278
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:07,346
wall, then the current that will
run is about oh point nine

279
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:09,722
amperes.
P equals V I.

280
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:16,399
This product must be a hundred.
And then the resistance that

281
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:22,51
you have is about a hundred and
twenty ohms.

282
00:20:22,51 --> 00:20:26,116
V equals I R.
So even though it's quite hot

283
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:31,094
-- a light bulb -- the amount of
light that it produces is,

284
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:35,73
in general, not more than
twenty percent of this power.

285
00:20:35,73 --> 00:20:40,279
It's not a very efficient
thing, an incandescent light

286
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,94
bulb.
A fluorescent tube is much

287
00:20:42,94 --> 00:20:45,859
better.
So if you have a forty watt

288
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:49,721
fluorescent tube,
you can much more light that

289
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:54,958
you get out of a forty watt
incandescent bulb.

290
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:59,477
If we take your heaters that
you have in your dormitories -

291
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:03,529
typically two kilowatts,
but let's make it twenty two

292
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,724
hundred watts,
because that divides nicely

293
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:11,633
through a hundred and ten volts
-- so then you would have twenty

294
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:14,282
amperes -- that's a lot of
amperes.

295
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:18,646
If the dormitory is very old,
chances are that your fuses

296
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,373
will go.
Twenty amperes is more than

297
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:25,425
many houses can handle.
But nowadays,

298
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:29,627
I think most outlets are good
for twenty five amperes or so.

299
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:33,4
But not for much more.
And so, now you have a resistor

300
00:21:33,4 --> 00:21:36,961
in your heater which is about
five point five ohms.

301
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:40,022
Just to give you a feeling for
some numbers.

302
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:44,366
N ow, you want heat out of your
heater, and you want light out

303
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:47,356
of your light bulb,
so you want to keep the

304
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:51,486
temperature of your heater
modest, not so high that you get

305
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:54,69
a lot of light.
If you make it two thousand or

306
00:21:54,69 --> 00:21:59,329
twenty five hundred degrees,
then you would get a lot of

307
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:02,091
light out of your heater.
And so suppose that half of

308
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:04,376
that power would come out in
terms of light,

309
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:07,51
and you turn on your heater it
night, would be like having a

310
00:22:07,51 --> 00:22:10,857
thousand-watt light bulb in your
dormitory, you don't want that.

311
00:22:10,857 --> 00:22:12,876
So how do you do -- what do you
do now?

312
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:15,161
Well, you simply keep the
temperature about,

313
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,87
maybe, thousand degrees
Centigrade, it gets a little

314
00:22:17,87 --> 00:22:20,951
red-hot, very little light is
produced, and how do you keep

315
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,501
the temperature low?
Well, you could cool it with

316
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:27,327
air, some of these heaters have
fans that cool them.

317
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:30,334
Or you just make the
resistance, you do both,

318
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:33,546
very large, huge surface area
of the resistance,

319
00:22:33,546 --> 00:22:36,894
not small, but large,
and so now they have a large

320
00:22:36,894 --> 00:22:40,585
surface area so they can radiate
their heat, and so the

321
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:43,934
temperature remains low.
So if you look at your --

322
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:47,351
things that you have at home,
you have light bulbs,

323
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:50,084
forty to two hundred watts,
your toaster,

324
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:53,775
maybe three hundred watts.
Your cooking plates and your

325
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:57,534
heaters, something like two
kilowatts,

326
00:22:57,534 --> 00:23:00,482
TV, a few hundred watts,
your electric toothbrush

327
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:02,754
probably only four watts,
very modest.

328
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:06,378
Your own body produces about
hundred watts heat -- of course

329
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:09,203
that's -- energy.
You have a very large surface

330
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:12,827
area, so you don't get nearly as
hot as a hundred-watt light

331
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:16,451
bulb, because your surface area
is large, so you only have a

332
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:19,644
modest ninety-eight degrees
Fahrenheit, unless you're

333
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:22,531
running a fever.
So you don't produce any light,

334
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:25,786
because you're not hot enough
for that, so you produce

335
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:29,733
infrared
radiation, and that's very

336
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:33,343
noticeable.
You hold someone in your arms,

337
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:37,128
the good feeling is,
you feel the body heat.

338
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:41,882
That's the infrared radiation.
That radiates at about a

339
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:45,404
hundred joules per second.
Hundred watts.

340
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:48,837
An electric blanket is only
fifty watts.

341
00:23:48,837 --> 00:23:53,591
So a partner is about twice as
effective as an electric

342
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:57,376
blanket.
Maybe also more fun.

343
00:23:57,376 --> 00:24:03,372
The power delivered by a
battery is the current that the

344
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:08,058
battery delivers times E,
which is this EMF.

345
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:13,944
And so when a current is
running, it is I squared times

346
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:20,048
the sum of the two resistances.
The external one plus the

347
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:24,191
internal one.
We can never bypass that.

348
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:28,877
The heat that is produced in
the

349
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:34,07
external one is I squared
capital R, but the heat that is

350
00:24:34,07 --> 00:24:38,614
produced inside the battery is I
squared little R,

351
00:24:38,614 --> 00:24:42,972
you can't avoid that.
And so if you make R zero,

352
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:48,442
by shorting out the battery,
then you get a current which is

353
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:54,377
the maximum current that you can
get, which is the EMF divided by

354
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:59,199
R of I -- so you've killed the
capital R,

355
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:05,375
it's zero now -- and so -- so
you get a power which is the

356
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:10,143
maximum power,
which is now E squared divided

357
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:14,585
by R of I.
I maximum squared times R of I.

358
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:19,461
It's the same thing,
it is the maximum current

359
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:24,337
square times R of I,
and all of that comes out

360
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:29,538
inside the battery.
Nothing comes out outside it.

361
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:34,414
If you have a nine-volt
Duracell

362
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:39,029
battery, the ones that we're
all so familiar with,

363
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:43,833
so then E is about nine volts,
the EMF, the internal

364
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:48,165
resistance of such a battery is
about two ohms,

365
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:53,439
and so the maximum current that
you can ever get out of a

366
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:58,619
Duracell battery would be about
four and a half amperes,

367
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,763
that is I Max,
would be about four and a half

368
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:07,377
amperes, and so P Max would be
about

369
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:10,56
forty watts.
So if you take a nine-volt

370
00:26:10,56 --> 00:26:15,334
battery, and you short it out,
then the battery should get

371
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:19,605
warm, because all that heat,
all that forty watts is

372
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:24,547
generated inside your battery.
The value for V of B that you

373
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:29,488
measured would go down to zero,
if you really could short it

374
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:33,341
out, with a resistor which has
zero resistance.

375
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:38,534
Now it's, of course,
a pretty stupid thing to do,

376
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:42,088
to short out a battery,
but it's not dangerous.

377
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:45,256
Forty watts,
the thing gets a little warm,

378
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:47,11
big deal.
So let's do it.

379
00:26:47,11 --> 00:26:49,274
So I have, here,
the voltage,

380
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,674
that you can see,
that we measure a nine-volt

381
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:55,842
Duracell battery,
I have the battery here.

382
00:26:55,842 --> 00:27:00,092
And you can read it here.
I hope the decimal point is in

383
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:03,337
there, but it's about nine point
six volts.

384
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:06,505
And now I am going to do
something stupid,

385
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:09,98
but,
again, it's not dangerous --

386
00:27:09,98 --> 00:27:13,557
I'm going to take my car keys
and I'm going to short out the

387
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,861
battery.
So simply connect point A with

388
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:19,681
point B, and so the voltage that
you're going to see is going --

389
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,833
maybe not go to zero,
exactly, because my key may not

390
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,744
have zero resistance,
but it goes very low -- and

391
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,775
what you cannot experience is
something that I can,

392
00:27:28,775 --> 00:27:32,17
that this battery will get hot.
These forty watts will be

393
00:27:32,17 --> 00:27:34,413
generated inside here.
It is possible,

394
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:37,809
though, that when the battery
gets hot, that the internal

395
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:41,104
resistance
may even go up a little

396
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:43,992
because, remember that
resistance goes up when

397
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:46,174
temperature goes up,
in which case,

398
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:49,639
the power will go down,
so it may not be the full forty

399
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:52,014
watts.
But I can assure you that I can

400
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:55,351
feel this thing getting warm.
So let me short it out,

401
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,827
now.
I'm doing this now.

402
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:59,266
And you read the voltage,
I can see it,

403
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:02,154
too here -- oh,
it's always not so easy with a

404
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:04,529
key to do that -- here,
it's very low,

405
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:07,545
hey, look at that.
It's about a tenth of a volt,

406
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:09,663
and I feel this thing getting
hot.

407
00:28:09,663 --> 00:28:13
It's really warming up,
now.

408
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15,044
And so I'm ruining this
battery.

409
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:18,802
This is a terrible thing to do,
batteries don't like that.

410
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:22,099
But, when I take off the
unintelligible resistance,

411
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:25,527
some of that may come back.
It may not be permanently

412
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,823
damaged, and you see,
it's already eight and a half

413
00:28:28,823 --> 00:28:31,197
volts.
So there's no way that you can

414
00:28:31,197 --> 00:28:34,164
start a car with a nine-volt
Duracell battery,

415
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:38,119
because you just can't get the
current that you need for your

416
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,086
starter engine.
Your starter motor needs a few

417
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:45,752
hundred amperes.
If you take a car battery,

418
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:50,47
that's about twelve volts.
It has a very low internal

419
00:28:50,47 --> 00:28:54,371
resistance, of about
one-fiftieth of an ohm.

420
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:59,452
So that means that the maximum
current that you can draw,

421
00:28:59,452 --> 00:29:04,079
if you short-circuit it,
would be something like six

422
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,799
hundred amperes.
And so the maximum power,

423
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,519
if you were so stupid to
short-circuit it,

424
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,874
that would all be generated
inside

425
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:19,292
the battery,
would be something like seven

426
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:22,543
kilowatts.
If you ever work on your car,

427
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:27,296
make sure that you never drop
accidentally the wrench that

428
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:31,381
you're using onto the battery.
Because if you did,

429
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:35,049
then inside the battery,
about six kilowatts,

430
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:39,801
seven thousand joules per
second, are going to be produced

431
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:43,72
in terms of heat,
and the sulfuric acid is going

432
00:29:43,72 --> 00:29:49,539
to boil, the case may melt,
and that's no good.

433
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:56,003
Not only is that stupid,
but it's also very dangerous.

434
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:59,417
So let's do it.
I have, here,

435
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:02,954
this battery,
and I have here,

436
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:05,881
the wrench.
Just in case.

437
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:12,345
I'm going to short out that
battery, and as I do that,

438
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:20,394
you will clearly see that the
battery doesn't like it.

439
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:25,38
I will be very careful not to
hold on to this wrench too long,

440
00:30:25,38 --> 00:30:30,284
because it would weld onto it,
actually, it can weld on to it

441
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:33,39
and stay there,
the current is so high,

442
00:30:33,39 --> 00:30:38,049
it can go up to six hundred
amperes, that it can weld onto

443
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,482
it, and then you can't get it
off any more.

444
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:45,16
In case that happens,
I will walk out of here.

445
00:30:45,16 --> 00:30:47,694
And I advise you to do the
same.

446
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:48,756
You ready?
OK.

447
00:30:48,756 --> 00:30:51,536
I go now.
You see?

448
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:54,807
That's what happens.
A very high current,

449
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:58,323
and when you do this too often
to batteries,

450
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,821
they're not going to live very
long, they don't like it.

451
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:07,483
But I wasn't joking when I
said, when you work on the car,

452
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:12,144
that you should avoid this,
because I have seen it happen,

453
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:16,151
that wrenches actually welded
onto the  terminals.

454
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:20,567
Your electric company charges
you

455
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:24,023
for energy, they don't care
about the power,

456
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:28,764
how many joules you use second,
but they care about how much

457
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:32,3
energy you're using.
So they will charge you,

458
00:31:32,3 --> 00:31:34,469
then, for joules,
you think.

459
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:37,844
That's energy.
However, if you look at your

460
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:41,461
bill, you're being charged for
kilowatt-hours.

461
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:45,559
Well, a kilo is thousands,
and an hour is thirty six

462
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:50,22
hundred seconds,
so the units of energy for

463
00:31:50,22 --> 00:31:53,381
which they charge you is this
in joules.

464
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:56,137
Two thousand watts.
Cooking plates,

465
00:31:56,137 --> 00:32:00,19
you run for two hours,
that is four kilowatt-hours.

466
00:32:00,19 --> 00:32:04,973
They will probably charge you
ten cents per kilowatt-hour --

467
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:09,918
for that same amount of money,
you could run your hundred-watt

468
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:14,457
light bulb for forty hours.
Again, that would be the same

469
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:19,078
four kilowatt hours -- or,
you could brush your teeth with

470
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:24,672
your electric toothbrush for
about one thousand hours.

471
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:33,271
Now I want to take a look with
you at a network which consists

472
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:41,165
of resistors and batteries.
And this is the kind of stuff

473
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:46,945
that you see on homework
assignments, and,

474
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:53,853
perhaps, on exams.
And so now, we start out with a

475
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:59,121
very modest
circuit, here we have a

476
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:03,699
resistance R 1,
here we have a resistor R 2,

477
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:08,064
and here R 3,
and then we put a battery in

478
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:13,175
here, and we put the plus side,
say, on the left,

479
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:16,582
this the plus side,
a minus side,

480
00:33:16,582 --> 00:33:22,012
and let the potential
difference of this one be V 2.

481
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:28,613
It's really the EMF,
but I will ignore any kind of

482
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:33,132
internal resistance of the
batteries, it's completely

483
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:38,085
negligible in this problem.
And here I put also a battery,

484
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:43,3
let this be the negative side,
and this be the positive side,

485
00:33:43,3 --> 00:33:46,689
and let the potential
difference be V 1.

486
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:50,861
And so, imagine that you know V
1, V 2, R 1, R 2,

487
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:54,076
and R 3.
But what I'm going to ask you

488
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,51
is, what is I 1,
what is I 2,

489
00:33:56,51 --> 00:33:59,725
and what is I 3?
I want the magnitude,

490
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:03,21
and
I want the direction.

491
00:34:03,21 --> 00:34:07,451
When you look at this,
it's by no means obvious that

492
00:34:07,451 --> 00:34:12,275
the current in this resistor
will be to the right or to the

493
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:17,098
left, it's by no means obvious,
it depends on the -- on the

494
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:20,508
values V 1 and V2,
and on the resistances.

495
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:25,415
The basic idea behind solving
these problems  are in what we

496
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:29,656
call Kirchoff's rules.
Kirchoff's first rule is that

497
00:34:29,656 --> 00:34:34,48
the closed loop integral over a
closed loop of E dot D L is

498
00:34:34,48 --> 00:34:38,339
zero.
We've seen that before.

499
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:41,665
I don't know why Kirchoff gets
the credit for this.

500
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:45,591
This always is the case when
we're dealing with conservative

501
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:48,053
fields.
When you start at a particular

502
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:51,645
point, you go around E dot D L,
you're back at the same

503
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:55,172
potential where you were before,
so this must be zero,

504
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:58,099
as long as you deal with
conservative fields.

505
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,825
So that's his first rule.
And you can do this closed loop

506
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:04,021
anywhere.
You can even do it here.

507
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:08,415
It would still be zero.
You can do it here.

508
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:11,047
Also zero.
You can do it there.

509
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:15,959
No matter where you do it,
that closed loop integral must

510
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,117
be zero.
And then there is the second

511
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,24
Kirchoff's rule,
and that is what we call charge

512
00:35:23,24 --> 00:35:26,661
conservation.
If there is a steady-state

513
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:30,608
situation, then,
independent of which junction

514
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:36,309
you go to, the current that
flows in must flow out.

515
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,635
Can't have a pile-up of charge.
That's the second rule.

516
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:43,598
And I gave you a problem,
three seven,

517
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:46,802
to work out,
and you can look in the book

518
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:50,487
how that is done.
However, I'm going to work on

519
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:55,052
this with you in a slightly
different way than the book is

520
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,416
doing it, which I,
personally, like better.

521
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:02,261
But it may confuse you.
So I warn you in advance,

522
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:06,746
you may not want to use my
method at all.

523
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:11,489
What I do is the following.
I say, OK, I assume that there

524
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:14,318
is a closed loop current here,
I 1.

525
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:17,979
And that there is a closed loop
current here,

526
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:20,807
I 2.
Whether I make them clockwise,

527
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:23,719
or counterclockwise,
is unimportant.

528
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:27,297
I could have chosen one
clockwise, the other

529
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:29,71
counterclockwise,
unimportant.

530
00:36:29,71 --> 00:36:34,286
However, once I choose a
direction, it has consequences,

531
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:39,507
as you will see.
And that's all that's running.

532
00:36:39,507 --> 00:36:43,716
One current like this,
and one current independently

533
00:36:43,716 --> 00:36:45,944
like that.
If I assume that,

534
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:49,41
then I have automatically --
automatically,

535
00:36:49,41 --> 00:36:54,113
I am obeying the second rules,
because a current that goes

536
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:56,754
around is -- charge
conservation,

537
00:36:56,754 --> 00:36:59,56
right?
There's no charge piling up.

538
00:36:59,56 --> 00:37:03,521
So the second rule of Kirchoff
is already obeyed.

539
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:07,234
So now I go to the first one,
and I can start,

540
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:11,496
now, at any point
in that circuit,

541
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:15,1
and go around -- I can go
around clockwise,

542
00:37:15,1 --> 00:37:17,846
I can go around
counterclockwise,

543
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:22,996
it makes no difference as long
as I return to the same point,

544
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:26,085
that integral E dot D L must be
zero.

545
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:29,089
I'm returning at the same
potential.

546
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:34,152
What is the integral of E dot D
L in going from point one to

547
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:37,242
point two?
Well, that's the potential

548
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:42,177
difference between point
one and point two.

549
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:46,017
And so let us start here,
and let us go around,

550
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:50,19
and we have to  adopt a certain
convention, namely,

551
00:37:50,19 --> 00:37:54,615
if we go up in potential,
and we go down in potential.

552
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:58,621
Again, you're free to choose
the sign convention.

553
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:02,127
But I would say,
when I go up in potential,

554
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:06,468
I give that a plus sign,
when I go down in potential,

555
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:11,726
I give that a minus sign.
So I start here.

556
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:15,677
I could have started there,
I could have started there,

557
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:19,335
makes no difference,
as long as I don't start here,

558
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:21,969
that makes no sense.
So I start here,

559
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,896
and I go around like this.
So right here,

560
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:26,871
I go down in potential,
V 1.

561
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:30,309
So I get minus V 1.
Now I go with current I 1 in

562
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,724
the direction,
from left to right,

563
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:36,455
so that means that the
potential here must be higher

564
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:38,211
than there.
V equals I R.

565
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:42,601
Potential here must be higher
than there.

566
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:47,365
So I go down in potential,
so I get minus I 1,

567
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:50,012
R 1.
Now I go through R 3.

568
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:53,4
This current,
I 1, is going down,

569
00:38:53,4 --> 00:38:59,329
so this has a higher potential
that here, so I go down in

570
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:03,458
potential, so I get minus I 1
times R 3.

571
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:08,963
But I have, independently,
a current I 2 which is now

572
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:13,833
coming towards me when I go
down.

573
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:18,33
And so if it comes towards me,
that current would give me an

574
00:39:18,33 --> 00:39:21,911
increase in potential.
This would have to have a

575
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:26,103
higher potential than this,
for this current to do this.

576
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:30,523
So now I climb up the potential
hill, so I get now plus I 2

577
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:34,333
times R 3 recording slows down.
normal speed Uh-oh,

578
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,305
look what I did,
I wrote down capital R,

579
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:40,963
clearly I meant R 1,
there is no capital R in the

580
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:44,393
whole problem.
Sorry for that,

581
00:39:44,393 --> 00:39:47,366
you should read this as minus I
1, R 1.

582
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:51,278
recording starts slow,
speeds up to normal I'm back

583
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:55,268
where I was, because these wires
have no resistance.

584
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,632
And so I'm back where I am,
so this is zero.

585
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:01,996
One equation with two unknowns,
I 1 and I 2.

586
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:04,5
So now, let's go around this
one.

587
00:40:04,5 --> 00:40:08,177
We can go clockwise,
we can go counterclockwise,

588
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:11,072
makes no difference.
Let's start here,

589
00:40:11,072 --> 00:40:15,648
and I go in this direction,
once around.

590
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:20,935
So now, I go through R 3,
and this current I 2 is running

591
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:25,09
in this direction,
so I go down in potential.

592
00:40:25,09 --> 00:40:30,189
So I get minus I 2 times R 3.
But current I 1 is coming

593
00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:33,777
towards me.
[inaudible] if I go in this

594
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:39,726
direction, I 1 is coming towards
me, so I climb up the potential

595
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:42,842
hill.
So I got plus I 1 times R 3.

596
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:49,556
Now I go through R 3 in this
direction, current I 2 is also

597
00:40:49,556 --> 00:40:53,954
in this direction,
and so this must have a higher

598
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:58,536
potential that this,
so I go downhill in potential,

599
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:03,392
so I have minus I 2 times R 2.
I come down here -- ah,

600
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:07,515
here's a battery.
And it goes up in potential.

601
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:10,63
So I get plus V 2,
and that's zero.

602
00:41:10,63 --> 00:41:13,471
Two equations with two
unknowns.

603
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,502
I can solve for I 1,
and I can solve for I 2.

604
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:23,06
So I 1 and I 2 pop out.
Let us assume that I 1 is

605
00:41:23,06 --> 00:41:25,681
positive, I find a positive
value.

606
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:28,777
It means, it's really in this
direction.

607
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,477
Let's suppose that I 1 is
negative.

608
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:35,923
I find minus three amperes.
Well, it means that I 1 is in

609
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:37,828
this direction,
big deal.

610
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,322
And so the whole operation is
sign sensitive.

611
00:41:41,322 --> 00:41:45,054
And the same is true here.
If I two is positive,

612
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:47,515
it means it's in this
direction.

613
00:41:47,515 --> 00:41:51,247
If I 2 is negative,
then it's in that direction.

614
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:55,137
How about I 3 now?
Well, let us assume that I 1 is

615
00:41:55,137 --> 00:42:01,321
plus three amperes,
and that you find that I 2 is

616
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:04,552
plus one ampere.
That's possible,

617
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:07,48
right?
You have two equations,

618
00:42:07,48 --> 00:42:11,418
two unknowns,
and these are the answers.

619
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:16,264
So three amperes goes like this
[wssshhht], down,

620
00:42:16,264 --> 00:42:20,404
and one ampere comes up.
Well, it's clear,

621
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:25,049
then, that I 3 is three minus
one, is plus two.

622
00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:30,703
Another way of looking at it
is, three amperes come in at

623
00:42:30,703 --> 00:42:34,963
this
juncture, I 2 is one ampere,

624
00:42:34,963 --> 00:42:38,725
so one ampere goes through,
so two must go down.

625
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:41,606
That's really Kirchoff's second
rule.

626
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:45,847
If I 1 were plus one ampere,
and I 2 was also plus one

627
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:50,729
ampere, then I 3 will be zero.
No current would flow through I

628
00:42:50,729 --> 03.

629
03. --> 00:42:53,37
But my method would still work.

630
00:42:53,37 --> 00:42:57,611
I find one ampere going down,
and one ampere going up,

631
00:42:57,611 --> 00:43:02,333
so there's no -- no current
going through R th- there's only

632
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:06,093
current
going in this direction,

633
00:43:06,093 --> 00:43:09,052
one ampere.
And we're recording slows.

634
00:43:09,052 --> 00:43:11,851
normal speed Uh-oh,
look what I did,

635
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:16,249
I wrote down I 1 R -- there is
no capital R in the whole

636
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:18,888
problem, I clearly meant I 1,
R 1.

637
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:22,167
So read minus I one R one.
Sorry for that.

638
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:25,366
starts slow,
speeds up to normal I'm back

639
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:29,444
where I was, because these wires
have no resistance.

640
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:32,883
And so I'm back where I am,
so this is zero.

641
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:37,957
One equation with two unknowns,
I 1 and I 2.

642
00:43:37,957 --> 00:43:41,038
So now, let's go around this
one.

643
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:45,564
We can go clockwise,
we can go counterclockwise,

644
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:49,127
makes no difference.
Let's start here,

645
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,883
and I go in this direction,
once around.

646
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:58,275
So now, I go through R 3,
and this current I 2 is running

647
00:43:58,275 --> 00:44:02,512
in this direction,
so I go down in potential.

648
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:09,157
So I get minus I 2 times R 3.
But current I 1 is coming

649
00:44:09,157 --> 00:44:12,215
towards me.
[inaudible] if I go in this

650
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:17,287
direction, I 1 is coming towards
me, so I climb up the potential

651
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,943
hill.
So I got plus I 1 times R 3.

652
00:44:19,943 --> 00:44:24,612
Now I go through R 3 in this
direction, current I 2 is also

653
00:44:24,612 --> 00:44:28,476
in this direction,
and so this must have a higher

654
00:44:28,476 --> 00:44:32,501
potential that this,
so I go downhill in potential,

655
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:36,768
so I have minus I 2 times R 2.
I come down here -- ah,

656
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:41,572
here's a battery.
And it goes up in potential.

657
00:44:41,572 --> 00:44:44,278
So I get plus V 2,
and that's zero.

658
00:44:44,278 --> 00:44:46,745
Two equations with two
unknowns.

659
00:44:46,745 --> 00:44:50,247
I can solve for I 1,
and I can solve for I 2.

660
00:44:50,247 --> 00:44:54,067
So I 1 and I 2 pop out.
Let us assume that I 1 is

661
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,694
positive, I find a positive
value.

662
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,797
It means, it's really in this
direction.

663
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,503
Let's suppose that I 1 is
negative.

664
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:06,96
I find minus three amperes.
Well, it means that I 1 is in

665
00:45:06,96 --> 00:45:10,382
this direction,
big deal.

666
00:45:10,382 --> 00:45:15,036
And so the whole operation is
sign sensitive.

667
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:20,006
And the same is true here.
If I two is positive,

668
00:45:20,006 --> 00:45:23,284
it means it's in this
direction.

669
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:28,255
If I 2 is negative,
then it's in that direction.

670
00:45:28,255 --> 00:45:33,437
How about I 3 now?
Well, let us assume that I 1 is

671
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:38,513
plus three amperes,
and that you find that I 2 is

672
00:45:38,513 --> 00:45:42,995
plus one ampere.
That's possible,

673
00:45:42,995 --> 00:45:45,559
right?
You have two equations,

674
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:49,009
two unknowns,
and these are the answers.

675
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:53,254
So three amperes goes like this
[wssshhht], down,

676
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:56,88
and one ampere comes up.
Well, it's clear,

677
00:45:56,88 --> 00:46:00,948
then, that I 3 is three minus
one, is plus two.

678
00:46:00,948 --> 00:46:05,901
Another way of looking at it
is, three amperes come in at

679
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:08,731
this juncture,
I 2 is one ampere,

680
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:13,153
so one ampere goes through,
so two

681
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:16,882
must go down.
That's really Kirchoff's second

682
00:46:16,882 --> 00:46:19,678
rule.
If I 1 were plus one ampere,

683
00:46:19,678 --> 00:46:24,339
and I 2 was also plus one
ampere, then I 3 will be zero.

684
00:46:24,339 --> 03.
No current would flow through I

685
03. --> 00:46:27,135
But my method would still work.

686
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:32,219
But my method would still work.
I find one ampere going down,

687
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:36,54
and one ampere going up,
so there's no -- no current

688
00:46:36,54 --> 00:46:41,963
going through R th- there's only
current going in this direction,

689
00:46:41,963 --> 00:46:45,437
one ampere.
And so, you have to recognize,

690
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:49,59
then, that I 3 is I 1 minus I
2,

691
00:46:49,59 --> 00:46:52,766
which is really application,
then, of Kirchoff's second

692
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,06
rule.
I like this idea,

693
00:46:54,06 --> 00:46:57,237
of a closed loop current,
I know that some of you don't

694
00:46:57,237 --> 00:47:00,119
like it, that's fine.
The reason why I like it is,

695
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,002
I g- always end up,
in this case,

696
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:05,12
with two equations with two
unknowns, I solve for I 1,

697
00:47:05,12 --> 00:47:07,708
I solve for I 2,
and then the third one comes

698
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,061
out in natural way by just
thinking, "Ah!

699
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:13,297
One current goes in this
direction and the other goes in

700
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,709
that direction." But if you
prefer the method that the book

701
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,532
will present to you,
you get three equations with

702
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:23,47
three
unknowns, and you get I 1,

703
00:47:23,47 --> 00:47:26,29
I 2, and I 3,
right at the start,

704
00:47:26,29 --> 00:47:30,342
you get an I 3.
You see, I don't even start off

705
00:47:30,342 --> 00:47:34,395
with an I 3, it's not there,
it comes in later.

706
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:39,153
So the choice is yours.
Now I want to entertain you for

707
00:47:39,153 --> 00:47:42,941
the last six minutes with
something amazing,

708
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:45,672
something that is truly
amazing.

709
00:47:45,672 --> 00:47:50,166
And it is a form of a battery
that is mind-boggling.

710
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:55,811
And the battery is right here,
on my -- my left,

711
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:59,84
on your right.
It is a battery that produces

712
00:47:59,84 --> 00:48:03,307
an enormous potential
difference, ten,

713
00:48:03,307 --> 00:48:07,992
twenty kilovolts -- you see a
schematic here on the

714
00:48:07,992 --> 00:48:11,74
transparency,
you have a bucket of water,

715
00:48:11,74 --> 00:48:15,675
unintelligible the top,
and you have glass,

716
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:20,922
and the bucket of water is
hiding behind here -- it's not

717
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:26,731
that because we hide it from
you, but that's the

718
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:30,994
best place to be -- and you see
plastic tubing coming down,

719
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:35,403
and the water can run out on
the right, and it can run out on

720
00:48:35,403 --> 00:48:37,314
the left.
It runs out here,

721
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:41,282
there is a, uh -- some paint
can, no top and no bottom.

722
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:45,177
And you see this paint can
here, it's completely open.

723
00:48:45,177 --> 00:48:48,704
There's a letter A.
And there's another paint can

724
00:48:48,704 --> 00:48:51,056
on the right,
there's a letter B.

725
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:54,804
It's a conducting can.
And this is also a conducting

726
00:48:54,804 --> 00:48:56,861
can.
And this water runs into

727
00:48:56,861 --> 00:49:03,616
another conducting  trash can,
and this water also runs into a

728
00:49:03,616 --> 00:49:07,787
conducting trash can.
And now comes the key point,

729
00:49:07,787 --> 00:49:12,044
that this conductor here,
A, is connected through a

730
00:49:12,044 --> 00:49:15,705
conducting wire with C,
and the conductor B,

731
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:19,451
the paint can,
is connected with a conducting

732
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:23,877
wire to this trash can D.
You let the water run for a

733
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:28,475
while, and you will see,
between there two points here,

734
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:32,303
sparks.
Even when the points are as far

735
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,343
apart as, say,
five millimeters,

736
00:49:34,343 --> 00:49:38,227
when you're talking about at
least a potential difference of

737
00:49:38,227 --> 00:49:40,991
something like ten,
fifteen thousand volts,

738
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:43,031
[poit], you will see the
sparks.

739
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:45,072
And you wait,
see another spark.

740
00:49:45,072 --> 00:49:47,639
And you wait,
and you see another spark.

741
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:51,324
So this is a power supply.
And that must be energy coming

742
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:53,957
from somewhere.
And so, problem four one,

743
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:57,775
which you haven't seen yet,
only unintelligible assignment,

744
00:49:57,775 --> 00:50:02,909
is asking you how this works.
I will demonstrate it today,

745
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:05,316
and I will come back to it
later.

746
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:08,401
The way it works is actually
quite subtle,

747
00:50:08,401 --> 00:50:10,809
but I want you to think about
it.

748
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:14,721
It's a remarkable battery,
a remarkable power supply.

749
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:19,01
As the water starts running,
I want to draw your attention

750
00:50:19,01 --> 00:50:23,449
to the fact that you can almost
anticipate when the start --

751
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:26,459
when the spark occurs,
because the water,

752
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:29,468
at the very last,
is beginning to spread.

753
00:50:29,468 --> 00:50:35,47
It doesn't come out any more,
just like a narrow cylinder,

754
00:50:35,47 --> 00:50:39,917
but it begins to spread.
And then comes the spark.

755
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:43,637
And then it goes back to
running normally,

756
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:47,267
and then slowly,
in time, it will spread,

757
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:51,623
and then comes the spark.
So let us get it going,

758
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:56,25
have some light here,
Marcos and Bill spent a lot of

759
00:50:56,25 --> 00:51:01,151
time getting this going --
Marcos, do we have -- are my

760
00:51:01,151 --> 00:51:07,04
lights the way you want them?
You're happy with that.

761
00:51:07,04 --> 00:51:11,791
There, you see the two bowls,
which are really here  and

762
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:16,63
let's first look at the sparks,
so I will start the water

763
00:51:16,63 --> 0.
running now.

764
0. --> 00:51:17,753

765
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:20,69
Let's just be patient a little
bit.

766
00:51:20,69 --> 00:51:23,628
And let's see unintelligible
spark.

767
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:25,96
Keep -- ah!
Did you see one?

768
00:51:25,96 --> 00:51:30,021
Did you see the spark?
Oh, you were not looking.

769
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:33,218
Man, I'm paying for this.
Look at the,

770
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:38,063
uh, look
at the two bowls.

771
00:51:38,063 --> 00:51:41,66
Give it some time again.
I have to charge up.

772
00:51:41,66 --> 00:51:45,257
Oh, I can already anticipate,
it's coming up,

773
00:51:45,257 --> 00:51:46,81
it's coming up,
dah!

774
00:51:46,81 --> 00:51:50,325
Did you see it?
Ten, fifteen thousand volts.

775
00:51:50,325 --> 00:51:55,475
Let's give it a little bit more
time, and then we'll take a look

776
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:58,254
at the water flow,
which I can see,

777
00:51:58,254 --> 00:52:02,26
I'm close, but we can make you
see the water flow.

778
00:52:02,26 --> 00:52:06,266
Look again.
Ah, it's coming up --

779
00:52:06,266 --> 00:52:08,053
ah!
Did you see?

780
00:52:08,053 --> 00:52:14,727
I could see it coming up.
I can make you listen by having

781
00:52:14,727 --> 00:52:21,4
my microphone near the water,
and you can hear this water

782
00:52:21,4 --> 00:52:26,405
running, unintelligible sound to
all of us.

783
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:31,53
And now, the sound changes,
you hear change?

784
00:52:31,53 --> 00:52:35,343
And there's the spark!
Once more.

785
00:52:35,343 --> 00:52:42,016
It's running,
spreading, coming up!

786
00:52:42,016 --> 00:52:43,563
Yah!
Amazing, isn't it?

787
00:52:43,563 --> 00:52:46,797
I can make you see this water.
Just stay there,

788
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:49,258
we have one and a half minutes
left.

789
00:52:49,258 --> 00:52:53,055
So now you can see the water.
You happy with the light,

790
00:52:53,055 --> 00:52:55,094
Marcos?
You can improve on it.

791
00:52:55,094 --> 00:52:56,781
So look at the water.
Ah!

792
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:01,07
It was just spreading already,
you can't see the spark and the

793
00:53:01,07 --> 00:53:04,445
water at the same time.
See, the water's running,

794
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:07,539
now, normally?
It's going to spread slowly --

795
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:13,233
I will tell you when I see the
spark here, but it's already --

796
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,728
I can almost predict when it
happens.

797
00:53:15,728 --> 00:53:19,401
The water is spreading now ,
coming up shortly -- yah!

798
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:23,005
unintelligible the spark.
And you immediately see the

799
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:26,262
water go like this.
I want you to think about it

800
00:53:26,262 --> 00:53:29,034
and explain this.
This is one of the most

801
00:53:29,034 --> 53:34
remarkable things I've ever seen
in my life.
