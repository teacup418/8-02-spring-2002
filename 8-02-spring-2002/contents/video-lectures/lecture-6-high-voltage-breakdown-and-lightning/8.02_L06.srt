00:00:00 --> 00:00:09,842



2
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:14,166
Last time I mentioned to you
that charge resides at the

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:18,491
surface of solid conductors but
that it's not uniformly

4
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:21,534
distributed.
Perhaps you remember that,

5
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:24,097
unless it happens to be a
sphere.

6
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:26,58
And I want to pursue that
today.

7
00:00:26,58 --> 00:00:31,225
If I had a solid conductor
which say had this shape and I'm

8
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:36,11
going to convince you today that
right here the surface charge

9
00:00:36,11 --> 00:00:40,035
density will be higher than
there.

10
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:44,666
Because the curvature is
stronger than it is here.

11
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:49,297
And the way I want to approach
that is as follows.

12
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:54,684
Suppose I have here a solid
conductor A which has radius R

13
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:59,788
of A and very very far away,
maybe tens of meters away,

14
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:05,175
I have a solid conductor B with
radius R of B and they are

15
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:08,483
connected through a conducting
wire.

16
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:12,453
That's essential.
If they are

17
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:18,554
connected through a conducting
wire, then it's equipotential.

18
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:21,808
They all have the same
potential.

19
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:26,588
I'm going to charge them up
until I get a charge

20
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:30,554
distribution QA here and I get
QB there.

21
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:36,859
The potential of A is about the
same that it would be if B were

22
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:40,825
not there.
Because B is so far away that

23
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:44,391
if I
come with some charge from

24
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:48,703
infinity in my pocket that the
work that I have to do to reach

25
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:53,015
A per unit charge is independent
of whether B is there or not,

26
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,631
because B is far away,
tens of meters,

27
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:58,458
if you can make it a mile if
you want to.

28
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,629
And so the potential of A is
then the charge on A divided by

29
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:05,174
four pi epsilon zero the radius
of A.

30
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:08,567
But since it is an
equipotential because it's all

31
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:12,949
conducting, this must be also
the potential of

32
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:17,153
the sphere B,
and that is the charge on B

33
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:21,147
divided by four pi epsilon zero
R of B.

34
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:26,822
And so you see immediately that
the Q, the charge on B,

35
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:32,707
divided by the radius of B,
is the charge on A divided by

36
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:37,647
the radius on A.
And if the radius of B were for

37
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:42,586
instance five times larger than
the radius of A,

38
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:50,301
there would be five times more
charge on B than there would be

39
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:53,393
on A.
But if B has a five times

40
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:59,784
larger radius then its surface
area is twenty-five times larger

41
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:06,278
and since surface charge density
sigma is the charge on a sphere

42
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:12,668
divided by the surface area of
the sphere, it is now clear that

43
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:17,41
if the radius of B is five times
larger than A,

44
00:03:17,41 --> 00:03:21,519
it's true
that the charge on B is five

45
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,129
times the charge on A,
but the surface charge density

46
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,295
on B is now only one-fifth of
the surface charge density of A

47
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:33,392
because its area is twenty-five
times larger and so you have

48
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:37,211
this -- the highest surface
charge density at A than you

49
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:39,641
have at B.
Five times higher surface

50
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:43,807
charge density here than there.
And I hope that convinces you

51
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,792
that if we have a solid
conductor like this,

52
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:50,681
even though it's not ideal as
we have here with these two

53
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:54,86
spheres
far apart, that the surface

54
00:03:54,86 --> 00:04:00,199
charge density here will be
larger than there because it has

55
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,361
a smaller radius.
It's basically the same idea.

56
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:09,881
And so you expect the highest
surface charge density where the

57
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:13,591
curvature is the highest,
smallest radius,

58
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:18,93
and that means that also the
electric field will be stronger

59
00:04:18,93 --> 00:04:22,097
there.
That follows immediately from

60
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:26,62
Gauss's law.
If this is the surface of a

61
00:04:26,62 --> 00:04:30,076
conductor, any conductor,
a solid conductor,

62
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:34,015
where the E field is zero
inside of the conductor,

63
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:38,517
and there is surface charge
here, what I'm going to do is

64
00:04:38,517 --> 00:04:42,697
I'm going to make a Gaussian
pillbox, this surface is

65
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:46,555
parallel to the conductor,
I go in the conductor,

66
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:50,735
and this now is my Gaussian
surface, let this area be

67
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:55,639
capital A, and let's assume that
it is positive charge so that

68
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,115
the electric
field lines come out of the

69
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:03,824
surface like so,
perpendicular to the surface.

70
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:06,873
Always perpendicular to
equipotential,

71
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:11,819
so now if I apply Gauss's law
which tells me that the surface

72
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,681
integral of the electric flux
throughout this whole surface,

73
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:21,214
well, there's only flux coming
out of this surface here,

74
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:25,912
I can bring that surface as
close to the surface as I want

75
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:29,339
to.
I can almost make it touch the

76
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,906
conductor.
So everything comes out only

77
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:35,214
through this surface,
and so what comes out is the

78
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:37,983
surface area A times the
electric field E.

79
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:41,9
The A and E are in the same
direction because remember E is

80
00:05:41,9 --> 00:05:45,276
perpendicular to the surface of
the equipotentials.

81
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:48,788
And so this is all there is for
the surface integral,

82
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:52,57
and that is all the charge
inside, well the charge inside

83
00:05:52,57 --> 00:05:56,351
is of course the surface charge
density times the area A,

84
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,715
divided by epsilon zero,
this is Gauss's law.

85
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:05,22
And so you find immediately
that the electric field is sigma

86
00:06:05,22 --> 00:06:08,733
divided by epsilon zero.
So whenever you have a

87
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:13,086
conductor if you know the local
surface charge density you

88
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:15,835
always know the local electric
field.

89
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:19,959
And since the surface charge
density is going to be the

90
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,243
highest here,
even though the whole thing is

91
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:26,908
an equipotential,
the electric field will also be

92
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:29,428
higher here than it will be
there.

93
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:33,399
I can demonstrate this to you
in a

94
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,842
uh very simple way.
I have here a cooking pan and

95
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:40,285
the cooking pan I used to boil
lobsters in there,

96
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:43,513
it's a large pan.
The cooking pan I'm going to

97
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:47,673
charge up and the cooking pan
here has a radius whatever it

98
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:51,761
is, maybe twenty centimeters,
but look here at the handle,

99
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:55,778
how very small this radius is,
so you could put charge on

100
00:06:55,778 --> 00:07:00,081
there and I'm going to convince
you that I can scoop off more

101
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:05,747
charge here where the radius is
small than I can scoop off here.

102
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:10,546
I have here a small flat spoon
and I'm going to put the spoon

103
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:15,184
here on the surface here and on
the surface there and we're

104
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:19,662
going to see from where we can
scoop off the most charge.

105
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:22,781
Still charged from the previous
lecture.

106
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:26,7
So here, we see the
electroscope that we have seen

107
00:07:26,7 --> 00:07:29,179
before.
I'm going to charge this

108
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:33,177
cooking pan with my favorite
technique which is the

109
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:36,616
electrophorus.
So we have the cat fur and we

110
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:39,664
have
the glass plate.

111
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:43,429
I'm going to rub this first
with the cat fur,

112
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:47,45
put it on, put my finger on,
get a little shock,

113
00:07:47,45 --> 00:07:50,445
charge up the pan,
put my finger on,

114
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:53,525
get another shock,
charge up the pan,

115
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:56,434
and another one,
charge up the pan,

116
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,113
make sure that I get enough
charge on there,

117
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,022
rub the glass again,
put it on top,

118
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:06,017
put my finger on,
charge, once more,

119
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:09,525
and once more.
Let's assume we have enough

120
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:12,865
charge
on there now.

121
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:17,411
Here is my little spoon.
I touch here the outside here

122
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:22,128
of the can -- of the pan.
And go to the electroscope and

123
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:25,559
you see a little charge.
It's very clear.

124
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:30,363
What I want to show you now
it's very qualitative is that

125
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:34,995
when I touch here the handle,
it's a very small radius,

126
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:37,654
that I can take off more
charge.

127
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:41,6
There we go.
Substantially more.

128
00:08:41,6 --> 00:08:43,644
That's all I wanted to show
you.

129
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:47,734
So you've seen now in front of
your own eyes for the first time

130
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:51,494
that even though this is a
conductor that means that it is

131
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:54,661
an equipotential,
that the surface charge density

132
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:58,619
right -- right here is higher
than the surface charge density

133
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,598
here.
Only if it is a sphere of

134
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:04,226
course for s- circle symmetry
reasons will the charge be

135
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:07,59
uniformly distributed.
If the electric field becomes

136
00:09:07,59 --> 00:09:10,69
too high we get what we call
electric breakdown.

137
00:09:10,69 --> 00:09:14,054
We get a discharge into the
air.

138
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:18,265
And the reason for that is
actually quite simple.

139
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:23,178
If I have an electron here and
this is an electric field,

140
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:28,003
the electron will start to
accelerate in this direction.

141
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:33,442
The electron will collide with
nitrogen and oxygen molecules in

142
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:38,882
the air and if the electron has
enough kinetic energy to ionize

143
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:43,882
that molecule then one electron
will become two electrons.

144
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:49,31
The original electron plus the
electron from the ion.

145
00:09:49,31 --> 00:09:53,222
And if these now start to
accelerate in this electric

146
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:56,607
field, and if they collide with
the molecules,

147
00:09:56,607 --> 00:10:00,594
and if they make an ion,
then each one will become two

148
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:03,453
electrons, and so you get an
avalanche.

149
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:07,666
And this avalanche is an
electric breakdown and you get a

150
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,299
spark.
When the ions that are formed

151
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,361
become neutral again they
produce light and that's what

152
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:17,145
you see.
That's the light that you see

153
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:19,571
in
the spark.

154
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:24,362
And so sparks will occur
typically at the -- at sharp

155
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:28,785
points -- at areas where the
curvature is strong,

156
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:34,128
whereby the radius is very
small, that's where the electric

157
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:39,012
fields are the highest.
How strong should the electric

158
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:42,697
field be?
Well, we can make a back of the

159
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:46,659
envelope calculation.
If you take air of one

160
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:51,312
atmosphere,
dry air, at room temperature,

161
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:55,12
then the -- the electron on
average, on average,

162
00:10:55,12 --> 00:10:59,657
will have to travel about one
micron, which is ten to the

163
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:03,546
minus six meters,
between the collisions with the

164
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:06,787
molecules, it's just a given.
On average.

165
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:10,676
Sometimes a little more,
sometimes a little less.

166
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:13,835
Because it's a random process
of course.

167
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:16,752
To ionize nitrogen,
to ionize oxygen,

168
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:21,251
takes energy.
To ionize an oxygen molecule

169
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:24,169
takes twelve-and-a-half electron
volts.

170
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,546
And to ionize nitrogen takes
about fifteen electron volts.

171
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:32,539
What is an electron volt?
Well, an electron volt is a

172
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,226
teeny weeny little amount of
energy.

173
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:39,603
It's one point six times ten to
the minus nineteen joules.

174
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:43,595
Electron volt is actually a
very nice unit of energy.

175
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:47,588
Because once you have an
electron and it moves over a

176
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:51,351
potential difference of one
volt,

177
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:54,989
it gains in kinetic energy,
that's the definition of an

178
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:57,752
electron volt,
it gains one electron volt.

179
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:01,39
It's the charge of the
electron, which is one point six

180
00:12:01,39 --> 00:12:05,298
times ten to the minus nineteen
coulombs, multiplied by one

181
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,454
volt.
And that gives you then the

182
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:11,093
energy, one electron volt.
And so what it means then --

183
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:14,529
let's assume that this number is
ten electron volts.

184
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,303
Do we -- we only want a back of
the envelope calculation.

185
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:23,423
So we want the electron to move
over a potential difference

186
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,315
delta V which is roughly ten
volts and we want it to do that

187
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:33,29
over a distance delta X which is
ten to the minus six meters,

188
00:12:33,29 --> 00:12:37,684
that's your one micron.
And if that happens you'll get

189
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:42,493
this enough kinetic energy in
the electron to cause an ion.

190
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:46,058
So what electric field is
required for that,

191
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,458
that is delta V,
the potential difference,

192
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,769
divided by the delta X,
so that is ten divided by ten

193
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:58,388
to the minus six,
so that's about ten to the

194
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:02,242
seven volts per meter.
That's a very strong electric

195
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:04,963
field.
In reality when we measure the

196
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:09,498
electric fields near breakdown,
it is more like three million

197
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,672
volts per meter.
But it's still very close.

198
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:16,3
This was only a back of the
envelope calculation.

199
00:13:16,3 --> 00:13:20,305
So very roughly at one
atmosphere air room temperature

200
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:24,311
when the air is dry we get
electric breakdown at about

201
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:28,694
three million volts per meter.
When the ions neutralize you

202
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:32,621
see
light, that's why sparks can be

203
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,357
seen.
They heat the air,

204
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:38,583
they produce a little pressure
wave, so you can also hear

205
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,3
noise.
If you had two parallel plates

206
00:13:41,3 --> 00:13:45,828
and you would bring those plates
closely together and suppose

207
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:49,904
they had a potential difference
of three hundred volts,

208
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:53,979
then you would reach an
electric field of three million

209
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:58,206
volts per meter when the
distance D is about one tenth of

210
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:02,356
a millimeter.
So that's when you expect

211
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:05,455
spontaneous discharge between
these two plates.

212
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:09,632
In practice however it probably
will happen when the plates are

213
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:12,596
further apart than one tenth of
a millimeter.

214
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:16,368
And the reason for that is that
there is no such thing as

215
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:19,4
perfect plates.
The plates have imperfections.

216
00:14:19,4 --> 00:14:23,374
That means there are always
areas on the plate which are not

217
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:26,877
flat, which are a little bit
like what you see there,

218
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:29,774
small radius,
and that's of course where the

219
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:33,411
electric field then will be
larger and that's where the

220
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:36,403
discharge will
occur first.

221
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:39,859
However, if you touch the
doorknob and you get a spark,

222
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:42,803
you feel a spark,
and you look at the spark and

223
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:46,324
you see that when you're three
millimeters away from the

224
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:49,844
doorknob that the spark
develops, you can s- pretty sure

225
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:53,685
that the potential difference
between you and the door was of

226
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,205
the order of ten thousand volts,
several thousand volts,

227
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:59,702
at least.
Because over three millimeters

228
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:03,542
it requires ten thousand volts
to get the three million volts

229
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,166
per meter.
When you comb your hair or when

230
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,511
you
take your shirt off you get

231
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:12,492
little sparks,
you can hear them and if it's

232
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:16,167
dark you can see them,
and you can be sure that at the

233
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,802
sharp ends of this hair,
of the fabric,

234
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:22,546
that you have developed
electric fields of the order of

235
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:26,706
three million volts per meter.
And then you get the automatic

236
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,203
breakdown.
Now of course high voltage

237
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:31,56
alone doesn't necessarily kill
you.

238
00:15:31,56 --> 00:15:35,79
What -- what -- what matters is
not so much the voltage to get

239
00:15:35,79 --> 00:15:40,878
killed but it's the current that
goes through you.

240
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:44,217
And current is charge per unit
time.

241
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:48,987
And so in SI units it would be
coulombs per second.

242
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:54,138
For which we write a capital A
which stands for Ampere,

243
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:59,861
the man who did a tremendous
amount of research in this area,

244
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:03,009
Frenchman.
And so if you touch the

245
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:08,256
doorknob the instantaneous
current may actually be quite

246
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:11,726
high.
It may be an ampere even,

247
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,379
but it may only last for one
millisecond.

248
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,7
And so that's not going to kill
you.

249
00:16:16,7 --> 00:16:20,811
We all know that when you comb
your hair that you don't die and

250
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:24,922
you also know that when you take
your shirt off even though you

251
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:27,708
may hear the sparks that that's
not lethal.

252
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,885
So maybe in a future lecture we
can discuss in some more details

253
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:35,665
what it does take to actually
execute someone electrically

254
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:39,445
which is very unpleasant but
nevertheless we would have to

255
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:43,423
evaluate how long the current
should last,

256
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:47,807
how strong the current should
be and then also during which

257
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:52,19
parts of the body the current
would cause lethal reactions.

258
00:16:52,19 --> 00:16:56,422
So I want to be a little bit
more quantitative now uh and

259
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:59,369
deepen our knowledge of the
VandeGraaff.

260
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:03,224
Slowly we're going to
understand how the VandeGraaff

261
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:05,869
works.
And today I want to calculate

262
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:10,554
with you how much charge we can
put on the VandeGraaff and what

263
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:13,501
the maximum potential is at the
surface.

264
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:17,204
If we charge up the
VandeGraaff,

265
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:21,023
with charge Q,
then the potential of the

266
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:26,799
surface is an equipotential,
is Q divided by four pi epsilon

267
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,226
zero R.
And the electric field right

268
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:36,198
here at the surface would be Q
divided by four pi epsilon zero

269
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:39,919
R squared.
So in this case of spherical

270
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,206
symmetry we have that the
potential V equals E times R.

271
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:49,612
But we know that E cannot
exceed

272
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:53,97
three million volts per meter.
And so that gives you now a

273
00:17:53,97 --> 00:17:58,175
limit on the potential that we
can give the VandeGraaff.

274
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:02,533
So if you substitute in here
three million volts per meter

275
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:07,198
you can calculate what potential
you can maximally reach for a

276
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:09,644
given sphere with a given
radius.

277
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:14,156
And if we here have the radius
and we here have the voltage,

278
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:18,284
then if the radius of the
sphere were three millimeters

279
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:22,107
then you could not exceed a
voltage

280
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:25,093
of ten kilovolts.
If you did you would get this

281
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:28,404
automatic electric breakdown.
You would get a spark.

282
00:18:28,404 --> 00:18:32,039
If you have a sphere of three
centimeters that would be a

283
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,674
hundred kilovolts and our
VandeGraaff, which has a radius

284
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:39,049
of thirty centimeters,
would therefore be one million

285
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,386
volts.
And you could not exceed that.

286
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,215
And in practice in fact this
one doesn't even make it to one

287
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,812
million volts.
The sphere is not perfect.

288
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:50,214
There are imperfections of the
sphere.

289
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:55,171
There are areas which have
so-to-speak sharp points and so

290
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:57,602
we won't make it to one million
volts.

291
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:00,887
We get a breakdown maybe at a
few hundred thousand,

292
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,121
maybe three hundred thousand
volts.

293
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,997
You can now also calculate what
the maximum charge is on the

294
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:09,231
VandeGraaff.
Because if the maximum

295
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,925
potential is three hundred
thousand volts,

296
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,619
you know the radius is point
three meters,

297
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:18,495
so you can calculate now what
the maximum charge is that you

298
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:21,517
can put on the VandeGraaff using
that equation,

299
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,554
will give you ten
microcoulombs.

300
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:27,365
And so the maximum potential
for our

301
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:31,63
VandeGraaff is of the order of
three hundred thousand volts.

302
00:19:31,63 --> 00:19:35,607
So this gives you now a
feeling, a quantitative feeling,

303
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,644
for numbers,
for what the -- can I put this

304
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:43,271
down, haha, so that gives you an
idea of what our VandeGraaff can

305
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:47,465
do, and later we will understand
how the charge gets there.

306
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:51,297
But at least you have some
feeling now for potentials,

307
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:53,972
and for the charges that are
involved.

308
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:59,539
If here's my VandeGraaff and I
approach the VandeGraaff with a

309
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:03,059
sphere which is connected to
the earth and if this

310
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,152
VandeGraaff had positive charge
on it then the sphere will

311
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:11,246
become negatively charged
through induction and so you get

312
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:15,268
field lines which go from the
VandeGraaff to this object,

313
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:18,284
always perpendicular to the
equipotentials,

314
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,947
so they go like this,
and so the electric field here

315
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:26,04
will probably be the strongest,
and so the spark will then

316
00:20:26,04 --> 00:20:30,35
develop between this sphere and
the VandeGraaff provided that

317
00:20:30,35 --> 00:20:34,671
you were close enough.
So that you do achieve a

318
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:38,28
electric field close to this
sphere of about three million

319
00:20:38,28 --> 00:20:41,257
volts per meter.
And I will show you that later,

320
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:45,121
you will see more sparks today
than you've ever seen before in

321
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:48,667
your life, but I want you to
appreciate a little bit more

322
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:52,53
about the sparks about lightning
before uh I demonstrate that.

323
00:20:52,53 --> 00:20:54,937
So you get a little bit more
out of it.

324
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:58,737
If I approach the VandeGraaff
not with the sphere but I would

325
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:02,221
walk to the VandeGraaff being
very courageous like this,

326
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,451
I'm also a pretty good
conductor,

327
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:09,007
I'm also connected with the
earth, then the chances are that

328
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:12,142
the spark would develop first
between my nose and the

329
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:15,88
VandeGraaff, because that is the
smallest curve -- the sha- the

330
00:21:15,88 --> 00:21:18,231
sharpest curvature,
the smallest radius,

331
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:21,245
or certainly my head,
would be a good candidate for

332
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,958
being hit first.
If I approach the VandeGraaff

333
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,093
like this with my hand
stretched, then chances are of

334
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:30,167
course that the sparks will
first develop between my

335
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,337
fingertips.
Because it's a very small

336
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:35,231
radius and they're very close to
the VandeGraaff,

337
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:38,487
and so that's where the
discharge

338
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:41,931
will occur.
So before we will enjoy some of

339
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:45,621
this, you will enjoy it,
I will enjoy it less,

340
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:50,623
um I want to talk a little bit
about lightning with you first.

341
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:54,969
Because what you're going to
see in a way is a form of

342
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:58,33
lightning.
There are four hundred thousand

343
00:21:58,33 --> 00:22:01,856
thunderstorms every day on
average on earth.

344
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:04,727
Four hundred thousand
thunderstorms.

345
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:08,826
There are about a hundred
lightning

346
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:12,201
flashes every second.
The top of a thundercloud

347
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:15,722
becomes positive and the bottom
becomes negative.

348
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:20,05
The physics of that is not so
easy, and probably incomplete,

349
00:22:20,05 --> 00:22:23,645
and I will not go into the
details of the physics,

350
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:27,386
but it does have to do with the
flow of water drops.

351
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:31,274
They become elongated,
they can become charged because

352
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:35,529
of friction, and they can break
off, and they can transport

353
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:38,023
charge.
I will simply give you some

354
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,59
facts.
And so I will accept the fact

355
00:22:40,59 --> 00:22:44,32
that
the cloud is going to be

356
00:22:44,32 --> 00:22:46,533
charged.
This is the cloud.

357
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:50,193
Positive at the top,
negative at the bottom.

358
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:53,853
And here is the earth.
Because of induction,

359
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:58,194
the earth of course will
therefore become positively

360
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:01,939
charged here,
and so we're going to see field

361
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:06,875
lines, electric field lines,
which go from the earth to the

362
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:12,323
cloud, always perpendicular to
the equipotentials,

363
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:16,853
something like this.
I'll give you some dimensions,

364
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,93
uh this may be something like
five kilometers,

365
00:23:20,93 --> 00:23:25,189
this vertical distance D is
about one kilometer.

366
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:29,538
These are typical numbers,
of course, it can vary

367
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:33,524
enormously from thunderstorm to
thunderstorm.

368
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:38,779
And this height is something
typically like ten kilometers.

369
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:43,128
And this allows us now to make
some

370
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:46,832
very interesting calculations
to get some feeling for the

371
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:50,271
potential difference between the
cloud and the earth.

372
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:52,388
That's the first thing we can
do.

373
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:55,959
If we make the simplifying
assumption that the electric

374
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:59,663
field is more or less constant
here, it's like having two

375
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:02,507
parallel plates,
where the electric field is

376
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,88
constant between them,
then the potential difference

377
00:24:05,88 --> 00:24:09,385
delta V between the bottom of
the cloud and the earth,

378
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:12,626
is simply the electric field
times the distance D.

379
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:17,422
So this becomes E times D.
But if the breakdown occurs at

380
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,939
three million volts per meter --
by the way that's dry air,

381
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:24,334
when it -- when there is a
thunderstorm it's probably not

382
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:27,73
so dry, but let's take the three
million volts per meter,

383
00:24:27,73 --> 00:24:30,823
so we get three times ten to
the six, that is for E,

384
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:34,34
and the distance between the
cloud and the earth let's take

385
00:24:34,34 --> 00:24:36,826
one kilometers.
So that's ten to the third

386
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:40,464
meters, so we get of the order
of three billion volts between

387
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:43,375
the earth and the clouds.
And the values that are

388
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:47,256
typically measured are several
hundred million

389
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:49,82
to one billion volts,
so it is not all that

390
00:24:49,82 --> 00:24:52,202
different.
You expect that the potential

391
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:55,867
is probably less than what we
have calculated because clearly

392
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:58,737
uh these are not flat surfaces,
there are trees,

393
00:24:58,737 --> 00:25:01,485
here on the ground,
there are buildings on the

394
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:05,149
ground, which are like sharp
points, where the electric field

395
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:08,447
will be locally higher,
and so you will get a discharge

396
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:11,867
at these sharp points first.
And that means the potential

397
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:15,531
difference between the cloud and
the earth could then be less

398
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:19,867
than the three billion that we
have calculated here.

399
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:23,082
It's only a back of the
envelope calculation.

400
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:27,466
The details of the physics of
the discharge very complicated.

401
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:31,338
But I want to share with you
some facts without giving

402
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:34,845
detailed explanations.
The start of the lightning

403
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:38,937
begins when electrons begin to
flow from the cloud to the

404
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,763
earth.
They form a funnel,

405
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:44,782
which is about one to ten
meters in diameter and we call

406
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:49,458
that the step leader.
The step leader moves about

407
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:53,85
a hundred miles per second and
so it comes down in about five

408
00:25:53,85 --> 00:25:56,999
milliseconds.
Five milliseconds from here to

409
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:00,733
here and it takes about half a
coulomb to the earth.

410
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:03,881
Half a coulomb,
for about five milliseconds,

411
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:07,615
that means the current is about
one hundred amperes.

412
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:11,129
The step leader creates a
channel of ionized air,

413
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:15,23
full of ions and full of
electrons, which is an extremely

414
00:26:15,23 --> 00:26:18,231
good conductor.
And with -- when this step

415
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:22,332
leader reaches the ground there
is this

416
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,183
highly conductive channel and
the electrons can now very

417
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:29,264
quickly flow from this channel
to the ground.

418
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:32,976
And that starts first right
here at the surface of the

419
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:35,567
earth.
That's where the electrons will

420
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:39,278
first go to the earth.
And then successively electrons

421
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,34
which are higher up in the
channel will make it down to the

422
00:26:43,34 --> 00:26:45,581
earth.
And so you're going to see

423
00:26:45,581 --> 00:26:49,573
electrons going through the
channel to the earth but first

424
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:53,984
the electrons are closer to the
earth than the

425
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:57,743
electrons farther away and then
even farther away.

426
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:01,731
And this is actually where most
of the action occurs.

427
00:27:01,731 --> 00:27:05,949
The current is now enormously
high, ten thousand to some

428
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:09,477
hundred thousand amperes,
and you heat the air,

429
00:27:09,477 --> 00:27:13,696
get a tremendous amount of
light, the ions recombine and

430
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:17,07
you get pressure,
heat can produces pressure,

431
00:27:17,07 --> 00:27:21,442
and there comes your thunder.
And so most of the action is

432
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:25,891
not in the step leader but is in
the second

433
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:28,899
phenomenon, which we call the
return stroke.

434
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,417
Which is from the earth to the
cloud.

435
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:35,404
And the speed of that return
stroke is about ten to twenty

436
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:39,602
percent of the speed of light.
During the return stroke there

437
00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:44,009
is about five coulombs exchange
between the cloud and the earth,

438
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:48,066
and five coulombs is a sizable
fraction of the total charge

439
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:52,333
that was on the cloud -- on the
cloud the first place -- t- to

440
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,202
start with.
After a return

441
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:57,496
stroke, maybe twenty
milliseconds later,

442
00:27:57,496 --> 00:27:59,497
this whole process can start
again.

443
00:27:59,497 --> 00:28:02,557
You can get a step leader.
And you can get the return

444
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:04,675
stroke.
However, the step leader will

445
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:08,206
now follow exactly the same path
that was made before because

446
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:11,913
that's where the air is ionized
so that's where the conductivity

447
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:14,326
is very high,
so that's the easiest way to

448
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,032
go.
And this process can recur

449
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:19,504
five, ten, maybe fifteen times.
So what a- appears to you as

450
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:23,094
one lightning bolt in fact could
be ten flashes back and forth

451
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:26,161
between the cloud and the
earth.

452
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:29,225
And the -- the real light is
not in the step leader,

453
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:32,41
that's very little light,
but the real light is in the

454
00:28:32,41 --> 00:28:34,813
return strokes.
So t- ten return strokes,

455
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,577
which may be twenty,
thirty, forty milliseconds

456
00:28:37,577 --> 00:28:40,461
apart, appear to you and to me
only as one flash,

457
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:43,826
which would take place maybe in
as little as a tenth of a

458
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:45,929
second.
And during these five or ten

459
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:49,413
return strokes you exchange
between the cloud and the earth

460
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:52,177
maybe a total of twenty-five to
fifty coulombs,

461
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:56,683
and that of course will lower
the potential difference.

462
00:28:56,683 --> 00:29:01,624
And if the potential difference
becomes too low then the process

463
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:04,29
stops.
You have to wait now for the

464
00:29:04,29 --> 00:29:08,682
clouds to charge up again.
And then lightning will strike

465
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:11,584
again.
And that can take anywhere from

466
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,485
maybe four, five,
ten, twenty seconds.

467
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,544
And then you get another
lightning bolt.

468
00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:22,249
The study of these -- of this
process, of the step leader and

469
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:27,19
of the return stroke,
can be done with a camera,

470
00:29:27,19 --> 00:29:29,665
which is called the Bors
camera.

471
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:34,377
Let me first explain to you in
detail -- in principle how it

472
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:37,333
works.
If this is the area on the film

473
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:42,045
that is exposed by your lens
suppose that I move the film at

474
00:29:42,045 --> 00:29:46,517
a very high speed to the left
and suppose the step leader

475
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:50,83
comes down and it sees some
light from the step leader,

476
00:29:50,83 --> 00:29:53,306
then I may see on the film
this.

477
00:29:53,306 --> 00:29:56,341
Some light.
And from here to here would

478
00:29:56,341 --> 00:30:00,178
then be
the five milliseconds which it

479
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:03,699
takes the step leader to go from
the cloud to the earth.

480
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:07,411
Now the return stroke takes
place with way higher speed and

481
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:11,316
so I see a tremendous amount of
light because there's a lot of

482
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:14,709
light in the return stroke.
And of course this is very

483
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:17,077
steep.
Because it goes a hundred times

484
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:19,638
faster up than the step leader
came down.

485
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:23,222
And so you can measure these
times and so you can get the

486
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:26,423
speed of the return stroke.
And then later in time,

487
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:29,751
maybe thirty,
forty seconds later,

488
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:32,417
on the film,
you may see another return

489
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,873
stroke.
And you may see another one.

490
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:38,801
And so you can see then how
long the time was between the

491
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:42,589
return strokes and you can also
calculate their speeds.

492
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:46,588
With a real camera it's not
really the film that is moving

493
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:50,656
but it is the -- the lens that
is moving, and the way these

494
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:53,673
pictures are taken,
and I will show you one,

495
00:30:53,673 --> 00:30:57,461
is if this is photographic
plate, then it is the camera

496
00:30:57,461 --> 00:31:02,301
that moves over the plate with a
um very high speed,

497
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:05,725
about three thousand
revolutions per minute,

498
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:10,024
and so you would get these --
this information then not

499
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:14,164
horizontally but you get it
spread out over the film.

500
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:18,145
But you get the same
information, you can calculate

501
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:21,33
speeds and times.
During the past decade,

502
00:31:21,33 --> 00:31:25,948
new forms of lightning have
been discovered which occur way

503
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:28,416
above the clouds.
Way higher up.

504
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:32,715
Red colors have been seen.
Red sprites they are called.

505
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:36,616
And also blue jets.
The light is

506
00:31:36,616 --> 00:31:40,94
very faint and it occurs only
for a very short amount of time.

507
00:31:40,94 --> 00:31:43,278
It's very difficult to
photograph.

508
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,751
I have not been able to get
good slides for today.

509
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:49,798
However, I did see some
pictures on the Web.

510
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:54,121
And when you log into the Web,
when you visit the Web eight oh

511
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,736
two which you should,
then I give you directions how

512
00:31:57,736 --> 00:32:01,917
to access slides pictures of the
red sprites and of the blue

513
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,468
jets.
The physics of that is not very

514
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:07,445
well understood.
It's being researched very

515
00:32:07,445 --> 00:32:11,698
heavily.
But it's way above the clouds.

516
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:15,442
There are also other forms of
electric breakdown,

517
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:18,874
of discharge.
They are different in the sense

518
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:21,448
that it's not an individual
spark.

519
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:25,503
But there is a continuous flow
of -- of -- of charge.

520
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:28,545
It occurs always from very
sharp points.

521
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:32,445
So there is a continuous
current actually going on.

522
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:36,969
And some of that you may have
seen but you may not remember

523
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:42,183
when we used a carbon arc here.
We had two carbon arcs,

524
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:44,742
two carbon rods,
and we had a potential

525
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:48,648
difference between them and we
got a discharge between them

526
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:52,621
which caused a tremendous amount
of light, which we used for

527
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:55,853
projection purposes.
So a carbon arc discharge is

528
00:32:55,853 --> 00:33:00,028
such a form of discharge whereby
you have a continuous current.

529
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:03,395
It's not just sparks.
If you take grass or trees or

530
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:06,829
brushes for that matter,
with thunderstorm activity,

531
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:10,263
they can go into this discharge
at their sharp tips.

532
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:13,698
And we call this brush
discharge,

533
00:33:13,698 --> 00:33:15,553
we call it St.
Elmo's fire,

534
00:33:15,553 --> 00:33:18,908
it's all the same thing,
it's also called corona

535
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:21,407
discharge.
I normally call it corona

536
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:24,191
discharge.
It produces light because the

537
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:26,974
ions when they neutralize
produce light.

538
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:30,258
Heat makes sound,
pressure, and so you can hear

539
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,399
this cracking noise of the
corona discharges.

540
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:37,753
An airplane that flies or a car
that drives, there is friction

541
00:33:37,753 --> 00:33:40,68
with the air,
and any form of friction can

542
00:33:40,68 --> 00:33:45,079
charge things up.
And so it's not uncommon at

543
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:49,078
night that you can see this
corona discharge from the tip of

544
00:33:49,078 --> 00:33:52,67
the wings of an airplane.
I've also seen it from cars.

545
00:33:52,67 --> 00:33:56,263
Corona discharge from cars.
Which charge themselves up

546
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:58,499
simply by driving through the
air.

547
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:00,736
The air flow would charge them
up.

548
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:03,718
You can hear it,
cracking, and you can see it

549
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:07,039
sometimes if it's dark enough,
you see some light.

550
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,834
In general it's bluish light.
Something completely on the

551
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:14,766
side, going back to the
lightning bolts,

552
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:16,787
lightning bolts,
the discharge,

553
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:19,684
the moving electrons,
can cause radio waves.

554
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:23,39
And these radio waves you can
receive on your car radio.

555
00:34:23,39 --> 00:34:25,815
And all of you have experienced
this.

556
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,443
Driving around,
lightning very far away,

557
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:32,148
you can hear it on the radio.
So that's telling you that

558
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:34,641
there is lightning going on
somewhere.

559
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:38,077
After a thunderstorm,
something that many of you may

560
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:42,12
not have experienced because in
the cities there is always --

561
00:34:42,12 --> 00:34:46,713
always exhaust from cars,
that spoils everything,

562
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:50,537
but when you're out in the
country after a thunderstorm

563
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:53,298
there's a very special smell in
the air.

564
00:34:53,298 --> 00:34:55,21
I love it.
And that's ozone.

565
00:34:55,21 --> 00:34:59,175
Oxygen two, oxygen two in
lightning becomes oxygen three.

566
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:01,866
And oxygen three has a
wonderful smell,

567
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,264
and you can really smell that.
It's very typical.

568
00:35:05,264 --> 00:35:09,583
I hope that most of you sooner
or later in life will have that

569
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:12,132
experience.
Go to the country after a

570
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:16,876
thunderstorm and you can really
smell this ozone.

571
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:21,227
Let's now look at some slides.
The first slide that you will

572
00:35:21,227 --> 00:35:24,692
see is one very classic slide
made by Gary Ladd,

573
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:28,748
a Kitt Peak Observatory in
Arizona, uh what I like about

574
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:31,919
this is that uh these are the
observatories,

575
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,983
the telescopes,
in the domes,

576
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:38,334
and of course when you're an
astronomer, this is the kind of

577
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:42,758
weather that you can do without.
But nevertheless it happens.

578
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:48,391
Uh you see here return strokes,
the light is definitely due to

579
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:51,082
the return strokes,
it's very bright.

580
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,342
These are step l- leaders that
never made it to the earth,

581
00:35:55,342 --> 00:35:59,676
and if a step leader doesn't
make it to the earth you don't

582
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:04,01
get a return stroke and so the
light as you can see here is

583
00:36:04,01 --> 00:36:07,074
much less.
And what you think here is only

584
00:36:07,074 --> 00:36:10,512
one bolt is probably at least
ten, five to ten,

585
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:12,156
maybe fifteen,
flashes.

586
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:15,37
Return strokes.
All right next slide please.

587
00:36:15,37 --> 00:36:20,452
Here you see the result of a
Bors camera exposure.

588
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:23,273
For those of you who are
sitting in front you can

589
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:25,977
recognize maybe the Empire State
Building here.

590
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:29,503
And the Empire State Building
is hit here by lightning at the

591
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:33,089
very tip, that's the sharp edge,
that's where you expect it to

592
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:35,029
be hit.
This is not taken when the

593
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:37,909
camera was rotating.
This is just the exposure the

594
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:41,259
way you and I would see it.
Not moving camera but here you

595
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:43,728
see the result of the rotating
Bors camera.

596
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:46,843
And this is the same flash.
So here you see the return

597
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:50,193
stroke, the -- the light from
the step

598
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:52,816
leader is too faint.
You can't see that.

599
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:56,649
So here is the return stroke
and then this time separation

600
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:59,003
may be thirty or forty
milliseconds,

601
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:01,625
see another stroke,
you see another one,

602
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,046
and another one,
so there's six here,

603
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:06,467
looks like you see a double one
here.

604
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:09,964
And so you have six or seven of
these return strokes.

605
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:13,797
And this is the way that you
can study speeds and how much

606
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:17,563
charge actually is exchanged
between these uh between the

607
00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:22,135
cloud and in this case the
Empire State Building.

608
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:25,226
Uh the next slide shows you a
corona discharge in the

609
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:28,614
laboratory this is a high
voltage supply with a very sharp

610
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:31,17
tip -- tip here at the end,
the sharp point,

611
00:37:31,17 --> 00:37:34,617
and here you see not individual
sparks, you don't call this

612
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:37,47
lightning but this is what you
would call the St.

613
00:37:37,47 --> 00:37:39,966
Elmo's fire,
the corona discharge is bluish

614
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,106
light.
And in fact when you are close

615
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:45,018
to this power supply you can
also smell the ozone.

616
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:47,99
It also produces locally ozone.
And you can see it.

617
00:37:47,99 --> 00:37:51,14
If you make it dark in the
laboratory you can see some

618
00:37:51,14 --> 00:37:54,783
bluish light.
Uh when I was a graduate

619
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:58,567
student I had to build power
supplies, high voltage power

620
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,622
supplies, and I remember when my
soldering job was not a very

621
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:06,678
good job that means when I take
the solder ironing off then I

622
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:10,936
could draw a little sharp point,
the solder, and that would then

623
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:13,977
later cause me problems with
corona discharge,

624
00:38:13,977 --> 00:38:18,235
that means I would have to redo
the soldering so that the radius

625
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:22,222
of the solder joint would become
larger, so no sharp points.

626
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:25,94
That's enough for the slides
right now.

627
00:38:25,94 --> 00:38:29,552
Benjamin Franklin invented the
lightning rod.

628
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:34,314
His idea was that through the
lightning rod you would get a

629
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:37,434
continuous discharge,
corona discharge,

630
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:40,226
between the cloud and the
building.

631
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:44,906
And therefore you would keep
the potential difference low.

632
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,518
And so there would be no danger
of lightning.

633
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:53,198
And so he advised King George
the third to put these sharp

634
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:57,96
points on the royal palace and
on uh powder

635
00:38:57,96 --> 00:39:01,492
houses, ammunition storage
places for ammunition.

636
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:04,877
There was a lot of opposition
against Franklin.

637
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:08,924
Uh they argued that uh a
lightning rod will only attract

638
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:11,573
lightning.
And that the effect of the

639
00:39:11,573 --> 00:39:14,811
discharge, lowering the
potential difference,

640
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,343
would be insignificant.
But nevertheless the King

641
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:22,096
followed Franklin's advice and
after the sharp rods,

642
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:24,377
the lightning rods,
were placed,

643
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:29,012
there was a lightning bolt that
hit one of the ammunition places

644
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:31,481
at
Pearl Fleet,

645
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:33,945
but there was very little
damage.

646
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:38,719
And so we now know that on the
one hand the discharge is indeed

647
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,721
insignificant.
And so the opposition was

648
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:44,339
correct.
And in fact you do attract

649
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:47,804
lightning, unlike what Franklin
had hoped for.

650
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:52,192
However, if your lightning rod
is thick enough that it can

651
00:39:52,192 --> 00:39:56,042
handle the high current,
which is ten thousand or a

652
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:59,815
hundred thousand amperes,
then the current will go

653
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:04,025
through the
lightning rod and therefore

654
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:07,907
there will not be an explosion.
So it will not hit the

655
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,69
building.
So it will be confined to the

656
00:40:10,69 --> 00:40:13,474
lightning rod.
And so it worked but for

657
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:17,722
different reasons than Franklin
had in mind, but he had the

658
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:20,871
right intuition.
Was a very great scientist,

659
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:24,094
and great statesman.
And so his lightning rod

660
00:40:24,094 --> 00:40:27,829
survived up to today.
So now I want to return to the

661
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:31,858
VandeGraaff and show you some of
the things that we have

662
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:35,984
discussed.
And the first thing that I

663
00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:39,018
would want to do is create some
sparks.

664
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:41,973
Lightning.
I run the VandeGraaff and I

665
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:46,204
will approach it with this small
sphere, small radius,

666
00:40:46,204 --> 00:40:50,596
and as I come closer and
closer, the electric field will

667
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:55,546
build up here and then I would
predict that as sparks fly over,

668
00:40:55,546 --> 00:41:00,177
that they would go between the
VandeGraaff and this uh this

669
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:03,849
sphere.
This sphere is grounded.

670
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:07,921
And so any current that will
flow will flow not through

671
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:12,746
Walter Lewin but will go through
the ground, so there's no danger

672
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:16,44
that anything will happen to me.
At least not yet.

673
00:41:16,44 --> 00:41:19,154
You already hear some cracking
noise.

674
00:41:19,154 --> 00:41:23,3
That means there are already
sparks flying around inside

675
00:41:23,3 --> 00:41:25,562
there.
It's very hard to avoid,

676
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:29,784
there are always some sharp
edges in there that we cannot

677
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:31,82
remove.
This is not an ideal

678
00:41:31,82 --> 00:41:36,134
instrument.
But I still think I will be

679
00:41:36,134 --> 00:41:40,133
able to show you some lightning.
By coming closer.

680
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:43,479
There we go.
So what you think is only one

681
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:47,641
spark may well be several like
these return strokes,

682
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:50,416
the way I described with
lightning.

683
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:54,987
So what you're seeing here now
is that the electric field

684
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:59,802
locally has become larger than
three million volts per meter

685
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:04,454
and then you're going to this
discharge phenomenon that we

686
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:08,919
described,
and that gives you then -- that

687
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:12,926
gives you the lightning.
What I will do now is I would

688
00:42:12,926 --> 00:42:16,706
like you to experience --
although it may not be so

689
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:20,789
fascinating for you -- to
experience a corona discharge

690
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:25,325
between a very sharp point that
I have here, extremely sharp,

691
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:28,878
and the VandeGraaff.
And the only way that I can

692
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:33,112
convince you that there is
indeed going to be a discharge

693
00:42:33,112 --> 00:42:37,496
between this point and the
VandeGraaff is by

694
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:41,309
approaching the VandeGraaff and
this cracking noise that you

695
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,539
hear now will disappear.
And the reason why it will

696
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:48,416
disappear is that if I get a
corona discharge between the tip

697
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:51,065
and the VandeGraaff it will
drain current,

698
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:54,813
it will lower the potential and
so that cracking noise will

699
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:57,203
disappear.
So the sparks which are now

700
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:59,594
flying over will not fly over
anymore.

701
00:42:59,594 --> 00:43:01,985
You will not be able to see the
light.

702
00:43:01,985 --> 00:43:04,052
It's -- it's too much light
here.

703
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:09,157
Although I can probably see at
the tip here this blue light.

704
00:43:09,157 --> 00:43:12,129
So I'm going to approach the
VandeGraaff now.

705
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:15,507
It's almost as if I had a
lightning rod and I'm not

706
00:43:15,507 --> 00:43:19,493
worried at all because if any
current starts flowing it goes

707
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:22,6
through this rod,
which is like a lightning rod

708
00:43:22,6 --> 00:43:25,235
to the earth.
So I'm not worried at all.

709
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,734
I just am very brave,
very courageous,

710
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:31,247
approaching the V- the
VandeGraaff, and I want you to

711
00:43:31,247 --> 00:43:34,895
listen to that cracking noise.
That cracking noise will

712
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:38,949
disappear when I'm going to be
-- draw a current through this

713
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,461
sharp point.
Oh, boy, there I go.

714
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:46,91
And the cracking stops.
And I can actually see here

715
00:43:46,91 --> 00:43:49,579
some glowing discharge,
bluish.

716
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:52,515
Will be impossible for you to
see.

717
00:43:52,515 --> 00:43:55,54
I can come closer,
I'm not worried.

718
00:43:55,54 --> 00:44:00,611
And so I'm draining charge now
off the VandeGraaff thereby

719
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:05,861
lowering the potential of the
VandeGraaff and so these crazy

720
00:44:05,861 --> 00:44:09,597
sparks that occur here can no
longer occur.

721
00:44:09,597 --> 00:44:13,985
But now they will.
Can you hear them?

722
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,693
And now you can't.
If I were crazy then I would

723
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:21,966
develop a corona discharge
between the VandeGraaff and

724
00:44:21,966 --> 00:44:24,868
myself.
One way I could do that is by

725
00:44:24,868 --> 00:44:29,14
approach it with my fingertips
as I mentioned earlier,

726
00:44:29,14 --> 00:44:33,977
but that may be a little bit
too dangerous because I may draw

727
00:44:33,977 --> 00:44:38,169
a spark, I may be hit by
lightning, which is the last

728
00:44:38,169 --> 00:44:42,765
thing that I would want today.
However, a corona discharge

729
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:46,663
using
these tinsels may be less

730
00:44:46,663 --> 00:44:50,105
dangerous.
So I get a continuous flow of

731
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:55,663
current which now unfortunately
doesn't go through the lightning

732
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:59,546
rod but now it goes straight
through my body.

733
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:03,163
And I can assure you that I can
feel that.

734
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:05,987
It's probably a very low
current.

735
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:08,899
It may be only a few
microamperes.

736
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:12,163
But it's not funny.
It's not pleasant.

737
00:45:12,163 --> 00:45:17,458
But anything for my students,
what the hell.

738
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:20,282
There we go.
Ya ya ya ya ya.

739
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:24,99
You see tinsels,
I'm now in a corona discharge

740
00:45:24,99 --> 00:45:31,163
and I feel the current through
my fingers, it's a continuous

741
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:33,779
discharge now.
This is St.

742
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:36,708
Elmo's fire.
You can't h- ah,

743
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:42,044
there was lightning.
Boy, you got something for your

744
00:45:42,044 --> 00:45:46,019
twenty-seven thousand dollars.
Oh, man.

745
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:48,635
OK.
So you saw both corona

746
00:45:48,635 --> 00:45:56,561
discharge and you saw lightning.
Boy, you were luckier than the

747
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:59,733
-- than the first class by the
way.

748
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:04,958
Clearly lightning can be
dangerous, lightning can cause a

749
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:08,784
fire, it can excite,
it can explode fumes,

750
00:46:08,784 --> 00:46:14,196
if you gas your car just the
flow of gasoline can charge up

751
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:20,074
the nozzle, friction can charge
things up, that's why the nozzle

752
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:25,019
is always grounded,
because a spark could

753
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,943
cause a major explosion.
If you fill a balloon with

754
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:33,338
hydrogen then the flow of
hydrogen is friction can charge

755
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:37,654
up the balloon and a spark can
then ignite the hydrogen.

756
00:46:37,654 --> 00:46:41,185
And this has led to a classic
tragic accident,

757
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:44,874
it's a long time ago.
But it's so classic that I

758
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:49,582
really have to show this to you.
Hitler was very proud of his

759
00:46:49,582 --> 00:46:52,564
large airships.
They're named after Gar

760
00:46:52,564 --> 00:46:56,567
Zeppelin the Germans called them
the

761
00:46:56,567 --> 00:47:00,12
Zeppelins, we call them
dirigibles or bl- blimps.

762
00:47:00,12 --> 00:47:04,487
And one of the largest ones
that Hitler's Germany ever built

763
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:08,04
was the Hindenburg,
eight hundred three feet long

764
00:47:08,04 --> 00:47:11,001
and seven million cubic feet of
hydrogen.

765
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:15,147
And the Germans couldn't fill
their Zeppelins with helium

766
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:19,44
because they didn't have helium.
And the Americans were not

767
00:47:19,44 --> 00:47:22,919
going to sell them helium,
for very good reason.

768
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:26,472
And so they had to fill them
with

769
00:47:26,472 --> 00:47:29,922
hydrogen.
And so the Hindenburg which was

770
00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:34,234
the name of this Zeppelin came
over in May nineteen

771
00:47:34,234 --> 00:47:39,495
thirty-seven and when it arrived
at Lakehurst in New Jersey it

772
00:47:39,495 --> 00:47:43,894
started a gigantic fire.
It came over in thirty-five

773
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:48,292
hours trans-Atlantic and you see
here the explosion.

774
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:52,173
May six at seven twenty-five in
the afternoon.

775
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:56,313
There were forty-five
passengers on

776
00:47:56,313 --> 00:47:59,676
board and thirty-five died in
this fire.

777
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:04,16
The speculation was that this
may have been sabotage.

778
00:48:04,16 --> 00:48:08,903
It's still quite possible.
Although the official inquiry

779
00:48:08,903 --> 00:48:12,612
board concluded that it was St.
Elmo's fire,

780
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:16,406
that as the uh ship moored on
this mast here,

781
00:48:16,406 --> 00:48:20,977
that a spark flew over and that
that caused the uh the

782
00:48:20,977 --> 00:48:24,857
explosion, the fire.
And it was the end of the

783
00:48:24,857 --> 00:48:29,342
dirigibles for Germany.
Napoleon, also not the nicest

784
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:33,876
man
on earth, uh had the suspicion

785
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:39,495
when many of his soldiers got
sick in Egypt that this was the

786
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:43,99
result of marsh gas.
And they suspected that this

787
00:48:43,99 --> 00:48:49,703
bad air that they could smell
when they were near marshes that

788
00:48:49,703 --> 00:48:54,76
that was the cause of the
disease, bad air in French is

789
00:48:54,76 --> 00:48:59,161
mal air, and so they called the
disease malaria.

790
00:48:59,161 --> 00:49:03,563
And so the way that they tested
the

791
00:49:03,563 --> 00:49:09,014
air to make sure that the
soldiers wouldn't get malaria

792
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:14,364
was to build a small gun which
was like so, this was a

793
00:49:14,364 --> 00:49:19,311
conducting barrel.
And they would let some of this

794
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:23,651
marsh gas in the gun and put a
cork on here,

795
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:27,488
close it off,
and here was a sharp pin,

796
00:49:27,488 --> 00:49:33,646
this pin was completely
insulated from the barrel,

797
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:37,211
the conducting barrel,
and then they would put some

798
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:40,206
charge on here,
so that the spark would fly

799
00:49:40,206 --> 00:49:43,201
over there.
This is really the precursor of

800
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:45,982
the spark plug that we have in
our cars.

801
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,476
It's no different.
And so if indeed there was then

802
00:49:49,476 --> 00:49:53,398
this marsh gas in there,
there might be an explosion and

803
00:49:53,398 --> 00:49:57,534
that was a warning then that um
there may be danger for the

804
00:49:57,534 --> 00:49:59,887
soldiers.
Well, this morning I was

805
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:04,023
walking through the building and
I was in Lobby seven and I

806
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:08,822
smelled some funny,
it was a funny smell,

807
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:12,803
and I was just wondering
whether perhaps,

808
00:50:12,803 --> 00:50:18,575
who knows, at MIT anything can
happen, whether uh there was

809
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:23,451
some uh some uh gas there that
shouldn't be there.

810
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:28,527
And so I brought my uh my
special gun which is here,

811
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:33,602
which is uh built after
Napoleon and uh you see here

812
00:50:33,602 --> 00:50:38,745
this uh little
sphere and I opened up the cork

813
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:42,867
here and I let some of that air
in, Building seven,

814
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:47,649
and then I decided that we,
you and I would do the test and

815
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:52,513
see whether perhaps there was
some uh some gas there that uh

816
00:50:52,513 --> 00:50:56,47
may cause some danger.
So I would have to cause a

817
00:50:56,47 --> 00:51:00,098
discharge then inside the -- the
barrel here.

818
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:05,126
I can try to do that by combing
my hair uh but that may not be

819
00:51:05,126 --> 00:51:09,248
sufficient amount of charge so I
can

820
00:51:09,248 --> 00:51:13,459
always make sure that there
will be a spark inside that gun

821
00:51:13,459 --> 00:51:17,307
and use this -- this disk.
Which has a little bit more

822
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:20,356
charge on it.
So here is then this uh Lobby

823
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:23,405
seven gas inside.
Now of course there's one

824
00:51:23,405 --> 00:51:27,253
possibility that there was
nothing wrong with the air,

825
00:51:27,253 --> 00:51:29,721
in which case you will see
nothing.

826
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:33,424
And there is another
possibility that the air wasn't

827
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:37,779
kosher enough and that you may
see here small bloop and since

828
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:42,111
it's going
to be very small at best you

829
00:51:42,111 --> 00:51:46,769
have to be very quiet otherwise
you won't hear anything.

830
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:50,071
And so let's first try now with
my comb.

831
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:54,39
I have my comb here.
To see whether I can generate a

832
00:51:54,39 --> 00:51:59,218
spark inside this barrel and
that may not work because I'm

833
00:51:59,218 --> 00:52:03,113
not sure that I get enough
charge on this comb.

834
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:08,11
No, that doesn't work at all.
Well, let's see whether we can

835
00:52:08,11 --> 00:52:10,915
use
this instrument.

836
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:14,073
I sure hope that we won't get
malaria.

837
00:52:14,073 --> 52:19
See you tomorrow.
