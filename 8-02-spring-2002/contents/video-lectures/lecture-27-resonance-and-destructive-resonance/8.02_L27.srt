1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,199



2
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,142
Before we're going to dive into
electromagnetic waves,

3
00:00:04,142 --> 00:00:08,606
I would like to discuss a few
more mechanical resonances with

4
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:09,797
you.
Last Friday,

5
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:14,038
we discussed the resonances of
string instruments and wind

6
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:17,163
instruments.
But there are several that you

7
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:20,883
see around you quite often --
without realizing it,

8
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:24,975
perhaps -- that you're looking
at a resonance frequency.

9
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:30,407
You may have noticed that
traffic signs have the tendency,

10
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:33,853
sometimes, to do this,
and at certain wind speeds,

11
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:37,089
they go like this.
Enormously strong amplitude,

12
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,833
that's a form of resonance.
Undoubtedly,

13
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:43,772
you have been motels or at
homes where you open a faucet,

14
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:47,57
and then all of a sudden,
when the water's running in a

15
00:00:47,57 --> 00:00:50,454
certain way, you hear an
incredible noise,

16
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:53,761
a terrible noise.
You close the faucet a little,

17
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:57,348
or you open it a little
further, and that noise goes

18
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,67
away.
That's clearly an example of

19
00:00:59,67 --> 00:01:02,938
resonance.
You drive your car,

20
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,494
or you're in someone else's
car, and at a certain speed,

21
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:09,145
something begins to rattle.
Very annoying.

22
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:11,214
You go a little faster,
it stops.

23
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:13,283
You go a little slower,
it stops.

24
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:16,775
Or, if you go a little faster,
something else begins to

25
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:20,396
rattle, there's some other
resonance of something else in

26
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:21,818
the car.
And of course,

27
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:25,245
there are cars whereby
something rattles at any speed.

28
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:27,443
But in any case,
there's this idea,

29
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:30,159
then, of resonance,
which is all around us.

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,845
I remember when I was in a
student,

31
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:38,254
and when we had an after-dinner
speaker which we didn't like

32
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:42,738
out, we would very quickly empty
our wine glasses -- in those

33
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:47,372
days, we were still allowed to
drink, by the way -- and what we

34
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:51,482
would do is the following,
something extremely annoying.

35
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:55,443
We would generate the
fundamental of our wine glasses.

36
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:58,208
You take your finger,
you make it wet,

37
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,6
and you rub it like this.
Listen.

38
00:02:00,6 --> 00:02:03,888
[Rubs glass].
Believe me, if hundred students

39
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:07,245
do that,
it's very annoying.

40
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,829
But it's also extremely
effective.

41
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:13,588
Speaker -- speaker gets the
message very quickly.

42
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:16,486
[Rubs glass].
What the glass is doing,

43
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:20,323
it's the fundamental of the
glass, it's the lowest

44
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:23,691
frequency, the glass is actually
doing this.

45
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:27,763
And there are rumors that
people can break glasses by

46
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:30,739
singing.
And we'll talk about that in a

47
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,619
minute.
Um, I remember a,

48
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,42
um, commercial,
Memorex.

49
00:02:34,42 --> 00:02:40,312
Memorex is an audio tape.
And they bragged about breaking

50
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:44,053
glasses -- some of you may
actually have seen that

51
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,81
commercial.
There was a,

52
00:02:45,81 --> 00:02:49,704
uh, a picture that I can show
you that goes with the

53
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:52,911
commercial, and then a very
dramatic story.

54
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:56,194
The story is that someone goes
to a concert.

55
00:02:56,194 --> 00:03:00,318
And there is a woman singer,
puts a glass on the table,

56
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,983
raises her voice,
this the resonance frequency of

57
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:08,717
the glass, [pshew!],
and there goes the glass.

58
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:11,481
And this gentleman was
recording it,

59
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:14,954
of course, on his Memorex tape.
So let's, um,

60
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:16,849
see this, uh,
this slide.

61
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:20,244
So if we get the slide -- yes!
You see this,

62
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:23,638
um, this glass,
maybe you can focus a little

63
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,086
better John, thank you.
Memorex.

64
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:31,059
So the story then goes that the
guy goes home and tells his wife

65
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:34,217
about this.
Well, she is smart enough not

66
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:38,085
to believe this story.
But he plays back his tape.

67
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:43,259
And at the moment
that this glass breaks at the

68
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,119
concert, he has some wineglasses
himself at home,

69
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,853
and lo and behold,
they also break.

70
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:53,391
And so the idea is,
that is the commercial --

71
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:57,813
that's the great pitch of
Memorex -- that the reason why

72
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:02,638
they break at home is because of
the enormous quality of this

73
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:06,095
tape which is made of very
special material.

74
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:09,794
And the material,
as you could have read on the

75
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:14,377
box, is a very special chemical
compound,

76
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:16,76
it is M R X two.
Two atoms of X,

77
00:04:16,76 --> 00:04:20,603
one of R, and one of M,
and then you make it oxide,

78
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:25,061
and then you have the best tape
that you can imagine in the

79
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,597
world.
Well, they overlook a small

80
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:30,902
detail, and that is that,
um, for one thing,

81
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:35,36
a tape recorder would never
generate enough volume to break

82
00:04:35,36 --> 00:04:39,279
a glass in the first place.
But in the second place,

83
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,814
the glasses that this guy had
at home, obviously didn't have

84
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:47,764
exactly
the same resonance frequency as

85
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:51,023
the glass at the concert.
So this could never had

86
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,671
happened.
But like with all commercials,

87
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:56,727
you know that you're being
swindled, and this,

88
00:04:56,727 --> 00:05:00,394
of course, no exception.
I've always questioned whether

89
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:04,197
it is actually possible that a
person, without the aid of

90
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:07,456
strong amplification,
and without the aid of huge

91
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:11,123
sound volumes which you can
generate with loudspeakers,

92
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:13,704
whether you can actually break
a glass.

93
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:17,032
I've always wondered about
that.

94
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:20,302
People say it can be done.
Caruso, famous singer,

95
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:22,687
was known for being able to do
that.

96
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:26,365
He put the glass there,
he would rub it with his finger

97
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:29,499
so that he knew the resonance
frequency [kllk],

98
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:32,156
and there he would go,
and [poit] bingo.

99
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:34,609
Frankly speaking,
I don't believe it.

100
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:38,833
I don't believe it can be done
by a human being without the aid

101
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,58
of amplifiers and speakers.
And when I lectured eight oh

102
00:05:42,58 --> 00:05:46,327
one, several years ago,
together with

103
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:49,97
Professor Feld here at MIT,
we discussed the -- the

104
00:05:49,97 --> 00:05:54,05
possibility of designing
something that actually would be

105
00:05:54,05 --> 00:05:57,912
able to break a glass.
And -- and he actually deserved

106
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:01,555
a lot of credit for that,
he worked with a graduate

107
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:05,635
student, and he managed to
design a setup that works most

108
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:08,549
of the time.
But don't put your hopes too

109
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:11,027
high, it doesn't work all the
time.

110
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:14,743
So here is a wineglass,
the same series as that one.

111
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:18,021
By the time -- when -- when he
got it to work,

112
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:21,907
we bought
five hundred of those glasses

113
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:25,408
-- we got a good discount,
by the way, because we wanted

114
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:28,335
to be sure that we can do it for
years to come.

115
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:31,708
So here's the wine glass,
and here is the loudspeaker,

116
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,954
and we are going to generate
sound very close to the

117
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:38,455
resonance frequency of this
glass, which we have already

118
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:42,21
determined before you came in,
four hundred and eighty eight

119
00:06:42,21 --> 00:06:44,437
Hertz.
You're going to see the glass

120
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:48,129
there, and to make you see,
actually, this wonderful motion

121
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,929
of the glass,
we will strobe it with light at

122
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:54,299
a
frequency slightly different

123
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:58,728
from the frequency of the sound
so you see the glass move very

124
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,342
slowly.
And then we will increase the

125
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:04,682
volume of the speaker,
and then with some like,

126
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:08,966
if we are right on resonance,
[poit], the glass may actually

127
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:11,58
break.
I think this is the sound that

128
00:07:11,58 --> 00:07:14,049
you're going to hear at low
volume.

129
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,591
[tone].
And I think I turned on the,

130
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:20,584
um, the strobe light now.
[tone] So I'm going to go make

131
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:24,651
it dark.
[tone] And I want to warn you

132
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:29,284
that the sound level is going
to be quite high.

133
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:35,428
[tone] I will have to protect
my ears, [tone] and you actually

134
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:40,666
may have to do the same.
[tone] I will first increase

135
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:46,407
the volume of the sound to see
whether I'm close enough to

136
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:50,537
resonance.
[tone] So this slow motion that

137
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:55,875
you see [tone] is the result
[tone] of the

138
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:12,354
strobe, [tone] which is not
exactly at the same frequency as

139
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:22,688
the glass.
I can change that a little.

140
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:33,86
[tone] All right.
So we are very close to

141
00:08:33,86 --> 00:08:44,194
resonance.
[tone] The glass is clearly

142
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:58,718
responding to the sound,
[tone] and now I will [tone]

143
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:14,358
cover my ears [tone] and slowly
increase the [tone] sound

144
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:21,899
volume.
[tone]

145
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:38,782
I can't go any louder.
[tone].

146
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:54,5
It's tough glass.
[tone]

147
00:09:54,5 --> 00:10:01,16
[glass breaking] [tone] It was
a tough glass.

148
00:10:01,16 --> 00:10:07,517
[applause].
I think you will probably agree

149
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:17,053
with me now that for a person to
do that without electronic help

150
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:26,437
is just not so believable.
The most dramatic example of

151
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:31,013
destructive resonance is the
collapse of the bridge in Tacoma

152
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:34,674
in nineteen forty.
Many of you may have seen that

153
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:37,953
dramatic movie,
but some of you may not have

154
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,775
seen it.
And even if you have seen it,

155
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:44,817
it's worth seeing it again.
With a little bit of wind,

156
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:49,392
there's a little bit more wind,
and just like with these wind

157
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:53,816
instruments, you're dumping a
whole spectrum of frequencies

158
00:10:53,816 --> 00:11:00,666
onto a wind instrument,
and it picks out the resonance

159
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,091
frequency.
And this bridge,

160
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:10,678
as you're going to see,
picks out its own resonance

161
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:16,212
frequencies.
And the consequences are quite

162
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:20,032
dramatic.
So if you can start,

163
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:26,092
Marcos, with this movie.
[sniffles].

164
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:29,156
It was nineteen forty,
and at this,

165
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:33,842
uh, in Washington State.
Movie: On the First of July,

166
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:37,987
nineteen forty,
a delegation of citizens met in

167
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:41,501
Washington State.
Movie: The weather was

168
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:46,367
beautiful, the occasion
historic, and the speech-making

169
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:49,43
and fanfare altogether
appropriate.

170
00:11:49,43 --> 00:11:54,296
Movie: This was the grand
opening of the Tacoma Narrows

171
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,927
Bridge.
Movie: From the beginning,

172
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:03,077
the bridge, which spanned Puget
Sound between Seattle and

173
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:07,302
Tacoma, was travel in style.
Movie: As well it should have

174
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,822
been.
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was

175
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:13,157
one of the longer suspension
bridges on Earth.

176
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:16,937
Movie: And, if somebody hadn't
overlooked something,

177
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:21,31
it probably would have remained
one of the longer suspension

178
00:12:21,31 --> 00:12:24,868
bridges on Earth.
Movie: The problem wasn't that,

179
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:28,5
right from the beginning,
alot of

180
00:12:28,5 --> 00:12:32,825
people didn't pay alot of
attention to details.

181
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:36,492
They did.
Movie: But somewhere along the

182
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:41,758
line -- and this was obvious in
the end -- it looks as if

183
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:47,305
someone forgot -- Look at those
cables over [unintelligible]

184
00:12:47,305 --> 00:12:51,913
Movie: -- of resonance.
Movie: Among other things,

185
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:57,273
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was
the most spectacular Aeolian

186
00:12:57,273 --> 00:13:01,749
harp in history.
Movie: Unfortunately,

187
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:06,416
its first performance was
destined to run only about four

188
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,916
months.
Movie: In the meantime,

189
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,582
she was a beautiful bridge.
Movie: Beautiful,

190
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:16,915
but a little strange.
Movie: Even before construction

191
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:20,415
was completed,
people observed its peculiar

192
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,165
behavior.
Movie: That was because,

193
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:27,498
even in a light breeze,
ripples ran along the bridge.

194
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:30,831
After a while,
one of the local humorists

195
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:34,586
called her
Galloping Gertie.

196
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:39,017
Movie: And for fairly obvious
reasons, the name stuck,

197
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:43,532
at least until the seventh of
November, nineteen forty.

198
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:47,044
Movie: Then as now,
Seattle and Tacoma were

199
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:50,138
sports-minded cities.
For four months,

200
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:54,904
a regional sport was to drive
across the bridge on a windy

201
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,579
day.
Movie: While some claimed it

202
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:01,76
was like riding a roller
coaster, others found it a

203
00:14:01,76 --> 00:14:06,096
little
disconcerting to see the car in

204
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,754
front disappear.
[laughter] Movie:

205
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:13,587
How popular this bridge sport
was, or to what extent it might

206
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:17,614
have spread across the country,
is anybody's guess.

207
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:20,996
Movie: On November seventh,
nineteen forty,

208
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:25,507
the winds were relatively
moderate, about forty miles per

209
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:28,084
hour.
Movie: A mew mode appeared.

210
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:31,709
Rather than ripple,
the bridge began to twist.

211
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,575
Movie: A wind of forty miles
per

212
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:40,296
hour is not too strong,
but it was strong enough to

213
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,6
start the bridge twisting
violently.

214
00:14:43,6 --> 00:14:48,888
I Contacted the physics teacher
of the local high school,

215
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:54,742
and we'll see him very shortly.
Thought he might be able to fix

216
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:56,442
it.
There he comes.

217
00:14:56,442 --> 00:15:00,785
I've known him some,
he told me that it was his

218
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,618
father.
No other example of re-

219
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:09,283
destructive resonance is more
impressive than

220
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,931
this one.
All right.

221
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:16,135
So now, we've had so much fun,
and we have to really get into

222
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:20,471
electromagnetic waves.
So we turn back to Maxwell's

223
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:25,848
equations as you see them here.
And Maxwell -- who was credited

224
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:30,098
for this extra term that he
added to Ampere's Law,

225
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:34,781
the displacement current term,
was able to predict that

226
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:39,204
electromagnetic waves should
exist, he predicted the

227
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:45,151
existence of radio waves,
which were later discovered by

228
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,279
Hertz, and that was a great
victory for the theory.

229
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,903
But, as I will show you today,
there was another enormous

230
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:58,362
victory around the corner.
Electric and magnetic fields

231
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:02,656
can move through space and
satisfy all four Maxwell's

232
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:06,042
equations.
The electric field results from

233
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:10,501
a changing magnetic field,
and a magnetic field results

234
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:16,779
from a changing electric field.
So one exists at the mercy of

235
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:21,286
the other, and the other exists
at the mercy of one.

236
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:26,058
Together, they propagate
through space -- they can even

237
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:30,653
propagate through vacuum,
where there are no charges,

238
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:33,392
and where there are no
currents.

239
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,28
Very mysterious.
I will write down a possible

240
00:16:37,28 --> 00:16:42,14
solution of an electromagnetic
wave which meets all four

241
00:16:42,14 --> 00:16:47,377
Maxwell's equations,
and this is the graphical

242
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:51,932
display of those waves that I'm
going to write down.

243
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:55,861
But I will discuss that with
you in a minute.

244
00:16:55,861 --> 00:17:01,041
The electric field is only in
the direction of X -- this is

245
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,434
the magnitude,
the largest value of the

246
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:08,81
electric field -- it's only in
the direction of X.

247
00:17:08,81 --> 00:17:13,007
Cosine K Z minus omega T.
This is the frequency,

248
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:17,74
and the minus sign tells you
that it is

249
00:17:17,74 --> 00:17:21,077
traveling in the plus Z
direction.

250
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:25,424
B, the associated magnetic
field, is B zero,

251
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:30,682
only in the Y direction,
with exactly the same cosine

252
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:35,332
minus omega T term.
So if I plot this at time T

253
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:40,084
equals zero, then you see this
curve right here.

254
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:44,23
And you see the magnetic field
curve here.

255
00:17:44,23 --> 00:17:49,083
The magnetic field is only in
the Y

256
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:53,547
direction, and the electric
field is only in the X

257
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:56,918
direction.
And this is a package that,

258
00:17:56,918 --> 00:18:01,565
together, moves in the
direction of plus Z with this

259
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:04,663
speed, which is omega divided by
K.

260
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:10,221
And the wavelength from here to
here is N two pi divided by K.

261
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:15,232
We call then plane waves,
and the reason why we cal them

262
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:18,877
plane waves is that,
if you take a plane,

263
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:25,293
anywhere perpendicular to Z,
that no matter where you are in

264
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:30,21
that plane, at that moment in
time, the E and the B vector are

265
00:18:30,21 --> 00:18:32,87
everywhere in that plane the
same.

266
00:18:32,87 --> 00:18:37,303
So think of this as a plane
perpendicular to the Z axis,

267
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:40,447
and then this whole train
passes by you.

268
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:44,477
And so you see the electric
field vector like this,

269
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:47,46
becomes zero,
like this, becomes zero,

270
00:18:47,46 --> 00:18:50,684
like this.
And the magnetic field vector,

271
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:54,392
maximum, zero,
this direction,

272
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:58,236
and so on.
But that's why they're called

273
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:02,18
plane waves.
These equations only satisfy

274
00:19:02,18 --> 00:19:06,123
Maxwell's equations under two
conditions.

275
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:11,545
And one condition is that B
zero is E zero divided by C,

276
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:16,475
and the other condition is that
omega divided by K,

277
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:21,108
which is the velocity,
with which it propagates,

278
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:25,545
I will call that C -- in
vacuum,

279
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:30,199
we call the velocity of
electromagnetic radiation C --

280
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:34,942
that is one divided by the
square root of epsilon zero,

281
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,314
mu zero.
If that's the case,

282
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:41,617
my two equations will satisfy
Maxwell's equations.

283
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:44,34
Imagine the victory for
Maxwell.

284
00:19:44,34 --> 00:19:48,907
Maxwell was not only able to
predict the existence of

285
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:53,562
electromagnetic waves,
but he was even able to predict

286
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:57,554
that
they would move through vacuum

287
00:19:57,554 --> 00:20:01,04
with that speed.
What an unbelievable victory,

288
00:20:01,04 --> 00:20:05,146
when you come to think of it,
that epsilon zero can be

289
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:09,639
measured -- in a static way,
if follows from Coulomb's law,

290
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:14,287
has nothing to do with the B
dT, has nothing to do with the E

291
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:16,223
dT.
Has nothing to do with

292
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:19,554
traveling waves.
Epsilon zero is about eight

293
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:24,047
point eight five times ten to
the minus twelve in SI units.

294
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:29,89
Mu zero is equally static,
can be measured from the force

295
00:20:29,89 --> 00:20:33,516
at which two wires,
through which you run a

296
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:37,573
current, attract each other.
No dB dT, no dE dT,

297
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:41,717
there's nothing to do with
electromagnetic waves.

298
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:46,896
Mu zero is about one point two
six times ten to the minus six

299
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:50,09
in SI units.
And if you multiply them,

300
00:20:50,09 --> 00:20:55,011
and substitute them in this
equation, you will find that C

301
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:59,932
equals two point nine nine times
ten to the

302
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:03,415
eight meters per second.
Unbelievable.

303
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:08,97
What a success for that theory.
It always baffles me how two

304
00:21:08,97 --> 00:21:13,584
quantities so static,
an seemingly so unrelated to

305
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:17,727
moving waves,
with dB dTs and dE dTs all over

306
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:22,435
the place, how they can predict
the speed of light.

307
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:27,802
Suppose I ask you to measure
the pressure in your tires of

308
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:32,509
your car, and I would ask you to
also

309
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:37,978
measure the voltage of your
battery, and then to predict the

310
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:41,964
speed of the car.
It's almost something like

311
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:43,725
that.
It is bizarre.

312
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:47,433
But it works,
and it was a great victory,

313
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:51,511
and of course,
it justified entirely this one

314
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:55,682
term, which is this displacement
current term.

315
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,668
Together, you and I will prove
that this is,

316
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:04,025
indeed, a necessary condition
so

317
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:08,019
that these equations satisfy
Maxwell's equations.

318
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:11,68
We will do it together.
I will do 50 percent,

319
00:22:11,68 --> 00:22:16,34
and you will do the other 50
percent at assignment number

320
00:22:16,34 --> 00:22:18,504
nine.
So we split this bill

321
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,666
fifty-fifty.
I will make a new drawing,

322
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:26,409
and I will do something that I
rarely ever do in lectures,

323
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:30,237
I will give you eight minutes
of hardcore math.

324
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:37,15
You're going to hate it.
I'm going to make a new

325
00:22:37,15 --> 00:22:44,067
drawing, which is not too
different from what you have

326
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:46,546
there.
So this is Z,

327
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:52,549
this is X, and this is Y.
And at T equals zero,

328
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:58,944
I'm going to draw here the
electric field like so.

329
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:04,164
So this is E zero,
electric field is this

330
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:09,45
strength,
and now I'm going to apply

331
00:23:09,45 --> 00:23:15,226
Ampere's Law -- that's my half
of the bargain -- closed-loop

332
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:21,099
integral of B dot D L -- you see
there -- equals epsilon zero

333
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:26,875
times mu zero times D phi E D T.
We're dealing with vacuums,

334
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:31,379
so kappa is one,
and the dielectric constant is

335
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:34,805
one.
And there is no such thing as a

336
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:39,995
current I, because we
are in empty space,

337
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:43,399
so this whole term does not
exist.

338
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:48,763
What does Ampere's Law require?
I need a closed loop,

339
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:54,642
and I need a surface that I
attach an open surface to that

340
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:58,768
closed loop.
I'm going to choose a closed

341
00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:03,719
loop in the plane Y Z.
And this is going to be my

342
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:07,742
closed loop.
This here is going to be my

343
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:12,28
closed loop.
This length is L,

344
00:24:12,28 --> 00:24:16,256
and the length -- or the width,
of this side,

345
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:20,954
is lambda divided by four.
I have to do a closed loop

346
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:24,749
integral of B dot D L,
I will do that last.

347
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:29,267
I will first do the hardest
part, which is the time

348
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:33,965
derivative of the electric flux
through this surface.

349
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:38,844
The problem is that the
electric field is not constant.

350
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:45,078
The electric field is zero
here, and has a maximum here,

351
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:50,037
and falls off in this way.
So I have to do an integral.

352
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:55,454
So I'm going to make a slice
here, and this slice here has a

353
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:59,127
width D Z.
And in that very narrow slice,

354
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:03,167
the electric field is
approximately constant.

355
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:07,299
Right here, the electric field
ahs this value.

356
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,982
But everywhere in that slice,
it has the same value,

357
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:16,481
because remember,
it's a plane wave.

358
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:23,028
And so I will draw here a line
parallel, and so everywhere in

359
00:25:23,028 --> 00:25:28,81
that slice, the electric field
has exactly this value.

360
00:25:28,81 --> 00:25:33,175
And that value is given by this
equation.

361
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:38,194
If you tell me what Z is at
time T equals zero,

362
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:42,994
I know what that value is,
that's this value.

363
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:48,61
So now I have to calculate the
electric flux.

364
00:25:48,61 --> 00:25:53,509
So phi of E -- I have to take
the dot product between D A and

365
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:56,938
the electric field.
Remember, flux is a dot

366
00:25:56,938 --> 00:26:00,367
product, E times D A.
I will choose D A up,

367
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:04,367
because E is also up,
so that makes life easy -- I

368
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:09,184
have to remember that later,
then, when I do the closed loop

369
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:12,94
integral of B dot D L,
then looking from below,

370
00:26:12,94 --> 00:26:16,614
I have to go clockwise,
because I remember the

371
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:20,264
right-hand
corkscrew rule.

372
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:25,659
So I get all my minus signs and
plus signs just right.

373
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:29,426
So D A an E are in the same
direction.

374
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:32,989
So what is D A of this little
slice?

375
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:37,162
That is L times D Z.
So I get L times D Z.

376
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:41,845
What is the local electric
field in this slice?

377
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:47,139
Well, that's that equation.
So I get E zero times the

378
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:52,507
cosine of K Z minus omega T.
This X roof,

379
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:56,968
of course, is gone,
because the A and E are in the

380
00:26:56,968 --> 00:27:01,065
same direction,
I have already taken that into

381
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:04,342
account.
But I have to integrate this

382
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:08,257
now, from Z equals zero to
lambda over four,

383
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:13,173
because I have to integrate it
over this whole surface.

384
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:18,362
So that's the -- the answer.
But I'm not interested in phi

385
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:21,184
E.
I have to know the phi E D T.

386
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:24,188
So it's going to be worse for
you.

387
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:28,371
I told you,
eight minutes,

388
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:33,437
pain in the neck.
So I'm going to take the time

389
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:38,173
derivative of that function,
so D phi E D T.

390
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:43,019
L and E zero can come out,
that's no problem,

391
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:48,196
they are constants.
I tae the time derivative of

392
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:53,814
cosine K Z minus omega T,
then minus omega pops out,

393
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:57,669
and the cosine becomes a minus
sign.

394
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:05,002
So I get minus
the sine of K Z minus omega T.

395
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:11,518
And I have to do an integral --
here is my D Z,

396
00:28:11,518 --> 00:28:19,026
zero to lambda over four.
This minus sign eats up this

397
00:28:19,026 --> 00:28:24,267
minus sign.
I have to do the integral,

398
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:33,192
but I do that at T equals zero.
In other words,

399
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:38,962
this thing goes away,
because T equals zero.

400
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:45,807
So I'm getting close.
So I'm going to continue here,

401
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:51,175
so I get L times E zero,
I have an omega,

402
00:28:51,175 --> 00:28:57,751
and now I have to do the
integral of sine K Z D Z.

403
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:07,682
Well, the K Z means I have to
get a K out, which is here,

404
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:13,527
and then the integral of sine D
Z is simply minus the cosine of

405
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:19,183
K Z, and I have to evaluate that
between zero and lambda over

406
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:21,917
four.
If I evaluate cosine K Z

407
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:26,726
between zero and lambda over
four, that's minus one.

408
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:32,382
I'm sure you can do that alone.
Times this minus one makes it

409
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:37,191
plus one.
And so the answer is L times E

410
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:41,948
zero times omega divided by K,
but we call that C,

411
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:47,481
in vacuum, that is the speed of
electromagnetic radiation.

412
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:51,171
So this is the answer to the
phi E D T.

413
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:56,607
Now, we have to do the closed
loop integral of B dot D L.

414
00:29:56,607 --> 00:30:00,491
And that is easy.
At this moment in time,

415
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:04,18
B is the maximum here,
which is B zero,

416
00:30:04,18 --> 00:30:08,687
and then it falls off to zero
here.

417
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:12,81
You can see the same there.
Suppose I start here,

418
00:30:12,81 --> 00:30:15,989
and I go this way,
this way, this way,

419
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:18,909
and this way.
Closed loop integral.

420
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:23,376
If I go from here to here,
my B and D L are at ninety

421
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:26,211
degree angles.
B is coming to you,

422
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:30,935
and B L i- D L is like this.
So there is no contribution

423
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:33,77
here.
If you go from here to here,

424
00:30:33,77 --> 00:30:38,752
well, B is zero everywhere
along the line.

425
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:42,547
So integral B dot D L from here
to here is zero.

426
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:44,727
It's a plane wave,
remember?

427
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,552
B is zero here,
it's also zero here,

428
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,781
it's also zero here,
it's also zero here.

429
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:54,172
If you go from here to here,
B and D L are,

430
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:58,935
again, at ninety-degree angles,
so there is no contribution,

431
00:30:58,935 --> 00:31:02,972
so there's only a contribution
due to this portion.

432
00:31:02,972 --> 00:31:05,878
And that I B zero times the
length L.

433
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:11,691
And now you see why I chose the
width lambda over four,

434
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:15,52
so I get a very easy result.
So I find, then,

435
00:31:15,52 --> 00:31:19,436
that B zero times L,
which is the left part of

436
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:23,7
Ampere's Law -- well,
it's too much to give Ampere

437
00:31:23,7 --> 00:31:28,574
credit -- all the credit,
because it's really Maxwell who

438
00:31:28,574 --> 00:31:31,185
added that term,
the phi E D T.

439
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:34,753
And so this,
now, is epsilon zero mu zero,

440
00:31:34,753 --> 00:31:39,8
which you see upstairs there,
times the result that we have

441
00:31:39,8 --> 00:31:42,933
here.
Oh, by the way,

442
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:46,06
this is E zero.
Times L, times E zero,

443
00:31:46,06 --> 00:31:48,089
times C.
And I lose my L.

444
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:52,314
And you see here a result that
is quite remarkable,

445
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:56,37
even though it doesn't look so
remarkable to you,

446
00:31:56,37 --> 00:31:57,892
yet.
The reason is,

447
00:31:57,892 --> 00:32:01,187
that you are going to do the
other half.

448
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:04,821
You are going to apply
Faraday's Law for me.

449
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:08,709
I only used Ampere's Law,
you're going to -- in

450
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:11,92
assignment nine,
use this relationship,

451
00:32:11,92 --> 00:32:16,483
which will allow you to prove
this.

452
00:32:16,483 --> 00:32:22,264
And once you have this,
substitute for B zero,

453
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:28,429
E zero divided by C,
and you see immediately that

454
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:33,567
the speed of light,
then, has to be this.

455
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:37,806
This is your task.
I did this end.

456
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:44,485
Yours is not easier than mine,
and I advise you also,

457
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:50,266
use this quarter-wavelength
trick.

458
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:54,993
All right, so you can
demonstrate that this is a

459
00:32:54,993 --> 00:33:00,323
necessary condition for
Maxwell's equations to satisfy

460
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:05,653
the, um -- this is not what I
want -- to -- that these

461
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:11,185
equations actually satisfy all
four Maxwell's equations.

462
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:16,817
Traveling electromagnetic waves
always have the following

463
00:33:16,817 --> 00:33:21,041
properties.
This is on the Web,

464
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:24,667
so you can download that.
E is perpendicular to V.

465
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,961
Notice that that's what I
chose.

466
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:30,512
E is perpendicular to V.
V is in the Z direction,

467
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:34,211
and E is like this,
so that's obviously why I chose

468
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:36,727
that.
B is also perpendicular to V.

469
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:40,648
B is in the Y direction here.
Only in the Y direction.

470
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:44,866
It's also perpendicular to V,
which is in the Z direction.

471
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:48,343
E is also perpendicular to B.
That's what I did.

472
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:52,782
E in the X direction,
B in the Y direction.

473
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:55,657
E and B are in phase.
That is like saying,

474
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:59,512
if this is cosine K Z minus
omega T, this also has to be

475
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:03,368
cosine K Z minus omega T.
They simultaneously go through

476
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:06,522
zero, and they simultaneously
reach a maximum.

477
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:10,027
What is also a necessary
condition, that E cross B,

478
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:12,901
the unit vector,
is in the direction of V.

479
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,916
Ha, look at that,
that's exactly what I did.

480
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:19,631
If you take E and you cross it
with B, you go into the

481
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:22,295
direction Z.
In fact, whenever you make

482
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:26,025
drawings
like this, you should always

483
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:28,977
what we call a right-handed
coordinate system,

484
00:34:28,977 --> 00:34:32,717
which is that X roof crossed
with Y roof is always Z roof.

485
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,867
If you don't do that,
you got yourself into muddy

486
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,097
water.
And then, in case you are in

487
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:42,1
vacuum, there is a correlation
between -- a relation between B

488
00:34:42,1 --> 00:34:45,84
zero and E zero that you are
going to prove with Faraday's

489
00:34:45,84 --> 00:34:48,399
Law, and then,
combined with my results,

490
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,27
the speed of electromagnetic
radiation in vacuum is one over

491
00:34:52,27 --> 00:34:56,076
the square root of epsilon zero
mu zero.

492
00:34:56,076 --> 00:35:00,646
If you know the frequency of
the electromagnetic radiation,

493
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:05,296
then the wavelength follows
immediately, and so you see here

494
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:08,685
a few examples that I've
calculated for you.

495
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:13,019
If you start out with a low
frequency of thousand Hertz,

496
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:16,802
you get a wavelength of three
hundred kilometers,

497
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:19,876
radio waves,
megaHertz, still talk about

498
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:23,343
radio waves, but when you go up
in frequency,

499
00:35:23,343 --> 00:35:26,653
the wavelengths,
of course, get shorter and

500
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:30,446
shorter,
we would call these radar

501
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:33,436
waves, microwaves.
If you go to ten to the

502
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:37,666
fourteen, ten to the fifteen
Hertz, you get into the domain

503
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:41,312
of infrared and visible light,
and the ultraviolet,

504
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:45,468
and if you go even higher,
then you end up with X-ray and,

505
00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:49,406
ultimately, gamma rays.
All of these are members of the

506
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:52,687
electromagnetic family,
electromagnetic waves.

507
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:56,479
This A with a little zero there
stands for angstroms.

508
00:35:56,479 --> 00:36:00,489
That means ten to the minus ten
meters.

509
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:03,703
So, a whole family of
electromagnetic waves,

510
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:08,186
and we give them names so we
can talk about them without ever

511
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:11,847
mentioning the specific
frequency or the -- or the

512
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:14,313
wavelength.
So given the fact that

513
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:18,124
electromagnetic waves then
travel with three hundred

514
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:22,159
thousand kilometers per second,
one foot would take one

515
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,699
nanosecond.
Twenty six one hundred,

516
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:27,464
thirty meters deep.
The light, for me,

517
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:31,947
to Professor Bertozzi all the
way at the end would take about

518
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:35,336
oh point
one microseconds.

519
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:38,723
One second, light,
radio waves to the moon.

520
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:43,321
Eight minutes it takes the
light from the sun to reach us.

521
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:47,596
The light from the nearest
stars will take five years.

522
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:52,678
And the nearest large galaxy to
the Earth would take two million

523
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:55,259
years for that light to reach
us.

524
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:59,695
So when you look at that
galaxy, then you see the galaxy

525
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:02,599
the way it was two million years
ago.

526
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,552
In astronomy,
we use as our meter

527
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:10,139
stick, a light-year,
which is the distance that

528
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,116
light travels in one year,
which is about ten to the

529
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:17,625
sixteen meters.
If you study a galaxy which is

530
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:22,148
at a distance of ten billion
light-years, you're looking at

531
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:25,97
the universe the way it was ten
billion years ago.

532
00:37:25,97 --> 00:37:29,245
So in astronomy,
you can look back minutes,

533
00:37:29,245 --> 00:37:33,378
you can look back years,
you can look back millions of

534
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:37,746
years, but you can also look
back in time

535
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:41,526
billions of years.
Most forms of electromagnetic

536
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:45,146
radiation -- certainly light,
and radio waves,

537
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:48,123
and radar -- can reflect off
surfaces.

538
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:52,225
At least, to some degree,
it depends on the surface.

539
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:56,65
And this is the basis behind
the distance determination.

540
00:37:56,65 --> 00:38:01,557
When you send a radar pulse to
an airplane, or to a rainstorm,

541
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:06,142
some of that radiation comes
back at you, and you know the

542
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:10,863
speed, and so that
allowed you to calculate the

543
00:38:10,863 --> 00:38:13,815
distance.
If the distance to the plane is

544
00:38:13,815 --> 00:38:18,243
D, and you send a brief pulse,
and it comes back -- they call

545
00:38:18,243 --> 00:38:22,598
it the echo -- and it takes a
certain amount of time to come

546
00:38:22,598 --> 00:38:26,804
back, which you can measure,
then that signal has traveled

547
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,347
twice the distance,
so that is the speed of light

548
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:34,332
times T, this is what you
measure, the distance in time

549
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:38,17
from the moment you sent the
signal until you get the

550
00:38:38,17 --> 00:38:42,928
reflection back,
and so you can calculate the

551
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:46,353
distance.
The distance to the moon can be

552
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:49,691
measured this way.
There are five corner

553
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:54,057
reflectors on the moon.
Three were left there by the

554
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:59,364
Americans and two were left by
the Soviets, in the days that it

555
00:38:59,364 --> 00:39:04,329
was still the Soviet Union.
An optical telescope from Earth

556
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:07,753
can send a very brief pulse,
laser pulse,

557
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:12,719
to these corner reflectors.
The l- the time,

558
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,971
the length in time of this
pulse is only one-quarter of a

559
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:18,793
nanosecond.
Just imagine,

560
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:22,97
light only travels seven
centimeters in one-quarter of a

561
00:39:22,97 --> 00:39:25,931
nanosecond.
So the kind of wave that you

562
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:30,715
get is really not very much of a
plane wave, the way we envision

563
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:32,158
it.
But in any case,

564
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:36,638
this pulse goes to the moon,
and then some of it comes back,

565
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:40,967
it's reflected off these radar
-- these corner reflectors,

566
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:44,916
not radar, it's light.
Laser light.

567
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,761
There are two times ten to the
seventeen photons,

568
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:53,167
roughly, in one of these
pulses, and only one comes back

569
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:56,211
per ten pulses.
So not much comes back.

570
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:59,816
But it's enough,
if you integrate it to get an

571
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:04,302
accurate distance determination
between us and the corner

572
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:08,227
reflectors, the accuracy is
about ten centimeters.

573
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:13,114
And the goal is really to get a
handle on the precise orbit of

574
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:16,719
the moon.
I can show you these

575
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,145
corner reflectors the way they
were built on Earth,

576
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:28,222
and then I will also show an
optical observatory as it is

577
00:40:28,222 --> 00:40:32,888
sending out these
quarter-nanosecond pulses,

578
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,493
laser light,
to the moon.

579
00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:39,182
So this is,
uh, one of those corner

580
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:43,74
reflectors.
They are designed in such a way

581
00:40:43,74 --> 00:40:50,801
that if light strikes it in a
certain direction,

582
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:55,794
that it reflects the light in
exactly the same direction

583
00:40:55,794 --> 00:41:00,606
backwards, hundred eighty
degrees, very clever design.

584
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:04,692
And so the next slide will show
you, in Texas,

585
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:08,051
McDonald Observatory is
sending, here,

586
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,321
these short,
brief pulses,

587
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:12,5
laser light,
to the moon,

588
00:41:12,5 --> 00:41:18,22
and what you see here is simply
some scattered light of the dust

589
00:41:18,22 --> 00:41:21,464
in the
Earth atmosphere.

590
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:25,644
And then only a teeny weeny
little bit of that comes back,

591
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:29,311
but that is enough to get the
distance to the moon.

592
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:33,711
There are, on the moon -- this
is enough for this slide to --

593
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:35,911
John -- there are,
on the moon,

594
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,918
several cameras.
They were left there by a

595
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:41,264
surveyor, they are small
cameras.

596
00:41:41,264 --> 00:41:44,491
The lens, I think,
is only two inches across.

597
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:47,864
And they keep an eye on the
Earth all the time.

598
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:52,485
Something that you may never
have thought of,

599
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:55,795
if you were on the moon,
and you look at the Earth,

600
00:41:55,795 --> 00:41:59,105
and the Earth is there,
say, that an hour from now,

601
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:02,615
the Earth will still be there.
And ten hours from now,

602
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:06,124
the Earth will still be there,
and ten years from now,

603
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,567
the Earth will still be there.
As seen from the moon,

604
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:13,076
the Earth never moves.
Of course, it rotates about its

605
00:42:13,076 --> 00:42:14,599
axis.
You will see that.

606
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:18,637
You will also see that certain
parts of the Earth are at night

607
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:21,22
and others are at day,
that's different,

608
00:42:21,22 --> 00:42:24,994
but it's always in the same
direction.

609
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:29,3
So it's very easy for these
cameras to keep an eye on us,

610
00:42:29,3 --> 00:42:32,529
so to speak.
All you have to do is aim them

611
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:35,989
in one direction,
and you never have to change

612
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:39,527
that direction.
Imagine that you and I were now

613
00:42:39,527 --> 00:42:42,987
on the moon, and we were looking
at the Earth.

614
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:46,985
And you, for instance,
would see the Earth as you see

615
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:49,292
it here.
Here is North America,

616
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:53,06
and this part of the Earth
happens to be daylight,

617
00:42:53,06 --> 00:42:56,674
and here it's night.
And this is the moment that

618
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:00,45
these
cameras are going to take a

619
00:43:00,45 --> 00:43:04,025
picture of the Earth.
So you expect to see a lot of

620
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:08,387
light here, and you expect this
to be night, here is New York.

621
00:43:08,387 --> 00:43:12,748
You may think that there is so
much light coming from New York

622
00:43:12,748 --> 00:43:16,896
that you may actually see New
York, that a picture taken by

623
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:20,042
these cameras actually may show
you New York.

624
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:23,045
Well, you won't,
but you see something else

625
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:26,763
which is very dramatic,
that's why I show this to you

626
00:43:26,763 --> 00:43:31,823
-- because the picture you're
going to see next -- John,

627
00:43:31,823 --> 00:43:35,932
you can show it -- is at the
time that two observatories on

628
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:39,758
Earth were both sending these
laser pulses to the moon.

629
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:43,655
And here you see one in
Arizona, and here you see one in

630
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:46,348
California.
But you don't see New York.

631
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:49,394
Isn't that amazing?
That you're on the moon,

632
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:52,299
and you know there's really
life on Earth,

633
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,842
someone is blinking at you.
Well, you don't see the

634
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,251
blinking, but you see these
lights.

635
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:01,159
Very dramatic
shot.

636
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:05,282
Thanks, uh, John,
that's fine.

637
00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:12,535
Radio waves can be generated by
oscillating charges.

638
00:44:12,535 --> 00:44:19,929
I will talk about that a great
deal the next lecture.

639
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:30,025
So you run alternating current
through wires called antennas --

640
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:35,523
this is an antenna -- and then
you create electromagnetic

641
00:44:35,523 --> 00:44:39,057
waves.
And radio stations transmit at

642
00:44:39,057 --> 00:44:42,787
a well-defined frequency.
For instance,

643
00:44:42,787 --> 00:44:47,793
WEEI transmits at eight hundred
and fifty kiloHertz,

644
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:52,407
wavelength three hundred and
fifty three meters.

645
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:57,61
Eight hundred and fifty
kiloHertz is an extremely high

646
00:44:57,61 --> 00:45:02,617
frequency.
How come I can hear things,

647
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:06,916
that I can hear music,
and that k- I hear someone

648
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:09,962
speak?
Well, this signal -- we call

649
00:45:09,962 --> 00:45:13,813
this the carrier wave -- is
being modulated.

650
00:45:13,813 --> 00:45:19,278
The strength of that signal is
modulated with the frequency of

651
00:45:19,278 --> 00:45:21,696
audible sound,
we call that,

652
00:45:21,696 --> 00:45:24,473
therefore, amplitude
modulation.

653
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:28,773
So, for instance,
if you looked at this signal as

654
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:32,983
a function of time,
then this would be the audio

655
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:39,033
modulation of that signal.
But the transmitter would

656
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:43,078
transmit eight hundred fifty
kiloHertz -- here,

657
00:45:43,078 --> 00:45:48,267
the signal would be a little
stronger, here a little weaker,

658
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:53,807
here a little stronger - and if
this were a thousand Hertz tone,

659
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:56,797
then this would be one
millisecond.

660
00:45:56,797 --> 00:46:00,403
At the receiving end,
you tune your radio,

661
00:46:00,403 --> 00:46:04,448
you change a capacitor
somewhere in your radio,

662
00:46:04,448 --> 00:46:08,846
you have an LRC circuit,
so that you

663
00:46:08,846 --> 00:46:13,895
are exactly on resonance at
eight hundred fifty kiloHertz,

664
00:46:13,895 --> 00:46:18,589
and you're not on resonance at
eight hundred and forty

665
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:22,398
kiloHertz, so you don't hear
other stations,

666
00:46:22,398 --> 00:46:27,89
but you really tune in on that
one station, and you can receive

667
00:46:27,89 --> 00:46:31,256
this signal, then.
And then you do some

668
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:35,154
demodulation to only hear the
audio envelope,

669
00:46:35,154 --> 00:46:38,52
and you hear speech and you
hear music.

670
00:46:38,52 --> 00:46:43,978
That's the idea.
Right here in twenty six one

671
00:46:43,978 --> 00:46:49,597
hundred, we have a transmitter,
and I can transmit sound at

672
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:52,988
almost any frequency that we
choose.

673
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:58,703
We have decided in honor of
you, to transmit a one kiloHertz

674
00:46:58,703 --> 00:47:02,578
audio signal at eight zero two
kiloHertz.

675
00:47:02,578 --> 00:47:06,163
The eight zero two is in honor
of you.

676
00:47:06,163 --> 00:47:11,2
At eight hundred and two
kiloHertz, there is no radio

677
00:47:11,2 --> 00:47:15,466
station,
so this is a nice thing to do.

678
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,814
We're not interfering with
anyone.

679
00:47:17,814 --> 00:47:21,799
We're going to transmit it
here, and then we have a radio

680
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:26,353
here, and we are going to search
for that signal at eight hundred

681
00:47:26,353 --> 00:47:29,697
and two kiloHertz.
That's what we're going to do

682
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:34,037
first before we're going to do
some other things which are not

683
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:36,385
so nice.
Now, Marcos is an expert,

684
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:40,868
in order to get the frequencies
right, so Marcos has promised to

685
00:47:40,868 --> 00:47:42,86
help me with this,
very nice.

686
00:47:42,86 --> 00:47:46,561
[tone] Oh, boy,
you're already on,

687
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:50,16
[laughs], we are already
transmitting at eight hundred

688
00:47:50,16 --> 00:47:53,148
and two kiloHertz,
and the station is already

689
00:47:53,148 --> 00:47:56,068
receiving it,
the station meaning our radio.

690
00:47:56,068 --> 00:47:58,92
[tone] Marcos,
let me convince the students

691
00:47:58,92 --> 00:48:01,229
that, indeed,
[tone] that it -- oh,

692
00:48:01,229 --> 00:48:03,809
you changed the frequency.
[tone] Yeah.

693
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:06,322
[tone] So he changed the audio
signal.

694
00:48:06,322 --> 00:48:10,328
[tone] So I want you [tone] to
appreciate that we really are

695
00:48:10,328 --> 00:48:13,588
transmitting from this antenna,
by unplugging it.

696
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:16,779
[tone] [static] So now the
radio doesn't see the

697
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:21,956
electromagnetic waves,
[tone] at eight hundred and two

698
00:48:21,956 --> 00:48:24,285
kiloHertz.
[tone] So the radio is

699
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:27,488
receiving now,
[tone] the radio waves that we

700
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,618
are producing.
[tone] Now, we're going to do

701
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:34,839
something that is not so nice.
[tone] We're going to change

702
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,187
our frequency to eight hundred
fifty KiloHertz.

703
00:48:38,187 --> 00:48:42,7
[tone] So now what are we going
to do is jamming the WEEA sport

704
00:48:42,7 --> 00:48:45,466
channel.
[tone] So you may hear our one

705
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:49,688
kiloHertz [tone] tone but you
may not hear [tone] what they

706
00:48:49,688 --> 00:48:54,332
are saying.
[tone] Can we first listen to

707
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:58,002
WEEI, [tone] before we do this
nasty thing?

708
00:48:58,002 --> 00:49:00,449
[tone] Radio:
[static] Radio:

709
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:03,681
uh, not the,
you know, Larry Dominique

710
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:09,186
matchup, but he says it was not
-- now what -- what was the date

711
00:49:09,186 --> 00:49:13,555
of Clemens' -- This is WEEI?
Radio: -- dig that up.

712
00:49:13,555 --> 00:49:17,137
Do we know the date?
Now be a naughty boy.

713
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:21,855
Radio: I've got all the,
uh, the Celtics playoffs dates

714
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:26,398
here -- [tone] We're doing
something

715
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:31,122
very illegal here.
[tone] In fact,

716
00:49:31,122 --> 00:49:38,28
we can do even worse.
[tone] I can be on the radio.

717
00:49:38,28 --> 00:49:44,864
[laughter] I'll have to turn
off my microphone,

718
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:51,449
because otherwise,
you wouldn't know whether it

719
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:58,32
comes from the radio,
or whether it comes from my

720
00:49:58,32 --> 00:50:02,573
microphone.
Hello, hello?

721
00:50:02,573 --> 00:50:05,545
Can you hear me?
This is radio WHTL,

722
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:09,195
it's a pirate station in the
Cambridge area,

723
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:13,865
we're now transmitting at eight
hundred fifty kiloHertz.

724
00:50:13,865 --> 00:50:18,449
Our weekly programs will be on
the latest excitement in

725
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:21,761
science.
Of course, we realize that this

726
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:25,751
is illegal as hell,
[laughter] but that's why we

727
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:29,571
like it so much.
[laughter] We start our first

728
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:33,397
program next
Monday at ten AM,

729
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:37,997
and if you have any questions,
feel free to contact the

730
00:50:37,997 --> 00:50:41,404
Physics Department of Harvard
University.

731
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:44,215
[laughter] See you next
Wednesday.

732
00:50:44,215 --> 50:49
[applause]
