00:00:00 --> 00:00:02,044



2
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:07,005
So last time we discussed the
interference patterns due to two

3
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:11,317
coherent light sources.
Today I will expand on this by

4
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:14,001
exploring many many light
sources.

5
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:18,881
Suppose instead of having two
slits through which I allow the

6
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:22,46
light to go I have many.
I have N, capital N.

7
00:00:22,46 --> 00:00:26,772
And let the separation between
two adjacent ones be D,

8
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:31,327
and so plain parallel waves
come in and each one of these

9
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:34,999
light
sources is going to be a

10
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:38,75
Huygens source,
is going to produce spherical

11
00:00:38,75 --> 00:00:41,904
waves.
And so now we can ask ourselves

12
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:46,847
the same question that we did
before, and that is look at a

13
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,683
long distance far away at
certain angle theta.

14
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:55,201
Where will we see maxima and
where will we see minima?

15
00:00:55,201 --> 00:01:00,145
And then we can put up here a
screen at a distance L and we

16
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:05,752
will call this X equals
zero, and then we can even ask

17
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:10,495
the question where exactly on
that screen will we see these

18
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:13,194
maxima?
You will have constructive

19
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:18,018
interference exactly the same
situation that we had with the

20
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:22,516
double-slit interference
pattern, when the sine of theta

21
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,215
of N equals N lambda divided by
D.

22
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:29,222
And if you're dealing with very
small angle theta,

23
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:34,129
you should all remember that
the sine of an angle is the same

24
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:39,072
as the angle itself,
provided that you work in

25
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,311
radians.
So for small angles,

26
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:44,271
you can always use this
approximation,

27
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,23
if you remember that it is in
radians.

28
00:01:47,23 --> 00:01:51,069
And that's only in the small
angle approximation.

29
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,708
And so the conclusion then is
if we work in radians for now

30
00:01:55,708 --> 00:02:00,506
that theta of N for the maxima
is then at N lambda divided by

31
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:04,505
D, N being zero right here,
N being one right here,

32
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:09,905
N being two right there.
And if you want to express that

33
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:13,596
in terms of a linear
displacement from zero then X of

34
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:16,932
N again for small angles is L
times that number.

35
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:21,333
And so now you get displacement
here in terms of centimeters or

36
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:25,166
in terms of millimeters.
So you will say well big deal,

37
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,999
it's the same result that we
had for uh the double-slit

38
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,696
interferometer.
We had exactly the same

39
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:34,039
equation.
There was no difference.

40
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,937
And D now is the separation
between two sources here.

41
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:42,476
It is obvious that it is the
same because if these two are

42
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:46,388
constructively interfering then
these two will too and these two

43
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:49,555
will too and these two will too
so all of them will,

44
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:53,467
so it's not too surprising that
you get exactly the same result.

45
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:57,13
But now comes the big surprise.
We haven't discussed yet the

46
00:02:57,13 --> 00:03:00,67
issue where the locations are
where light plus light gives

47
00:03:00,67 --> 00:03:02,719
darkness.
We haven't discussed the

48
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,134
destructive interference.
And to derive that properly is

49
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:08,618
very tricky.
In fact if you take eight oh

50
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:12,433
three you will see a perfect
derivation.

51
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,96
But I will give you the
results.

52
00:03:14,96 --> 00:03:19,198
What is not so intuitive,
that if you have N sources,

53
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:24,17
that between two major maxima,
that means between this maximum

54
00:03:24,17 --> 00:03:27,92
at N equals zero and a maximum
at N equals one,

55
00:03:27,92 --> 00:03:31,506
there are now N,
capital N, minus one minima.

56
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:35,582
And minima means complete
destructive interference.

57
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,331
So if capital N is two,
which we did last time,

58
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:44,548
two minus one is one,
exactly, that was correct.

59
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:48,404
We had only one zero in between
the two maxima.

60
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:53,434
But that's not the case anymore
when capital N is much larger

61
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,787
than two.
And so let me now make you a --

62
00:03:56,787 --> 00:04:01,314
a sketch whereby I plot the
intensity of the light as a

63
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:05,421
function of angle theta and this
is the intensity,

64
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:10,032
so that's in watts per square
meter, remember that's the

65
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:14,307
pointing vector,
and let this be zero,

66
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:20,149
and let the angle theta one be
here, and for small angles then

67
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,415
that's lambda divided by D,
and here you have theta two,

68
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:29,533
which is two lambda divided by
D, and so on.

69
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,98
I take the small angle
approximation.

70
00:04:32,98 --> 00:04:35,949
So this angle is now in
radians.

71
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,215
What you're going to see now is
the following intensity,

72
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:46,673
as a function of theta.
You see here a peak,

73
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:51,153
and you're going to see here a
peak, and you're going to see

74
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:54,949
here one, and so on,
and the same of course is true

75
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,289
on the other side.
And here in between you're

76
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,844
going to see now N minus one
locations whereby you have total

77
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:07,019
destructive interference.
And the same is the case here.

78
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,36
And this can be huge.
N can be a few hundred.

79
00:05:10,36 --> 00:05:16,129
So we have many many locations
where you have a hundred percent

80
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:20,543
destructive interference.
Now this point,

81
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:25,177
this first location,
where we hit the zero,

82
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:31,466
that now is at the position
lambda divided by D divided by

83
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:35,99
capital N.
And I will call that angle from

84
00:05:35,99 --> 00:05:42,059
the maximum to that zero from
this maximum to this zero,

85
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:47,245
I will call that angle for now
delta

86
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:50,846
theta.
Because that delta theta is a

87
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:56,3
measure for the width of the
line, here is at maximum,

88
00:05:56,3 --> 00:06:00,931
here it is zero,
and so that angle delta theta

89
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:06,076
in terms of radians is lambda
divided by D times N,

90
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:11,222
which then is approximately
theta one divided by N,

91
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:16,058
because theta one itself is
lambda divided by D.

92
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:20,12
And so
you see that it is N times

93
00:06:20,12 --> 00:06:24,009
smaller than this distance.
And so if N is large,

94
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,384
these lines become extremely
narrow, and that's the big

95
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:33,002
difference between two-slit
interference and multiple-slit

96
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,676
interference.
And the larger N is,

97
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:40,294
the higher these peaks will be.
The height of these peaks,

98
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:44,183
the intensity here,
is proportional to N squared.

99
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:50,422
And you may see gee why -- why
not -- is why is it not linearly

100
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:53,004
proportional to N?
Well that's easy to see.

101
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:56,139
Suppose I increase capital N,
the number of sources,

102
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,275
by a factor of three.
Then the electric field vector

103
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:01,98
where there are maxima is three
times larger.

104
00:07:01,98 --> 00:07:05,484
But if the electric field
vector is three times larger the

105
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,697
pointing vector is nine times
larger.

106
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:09,665
So you get nine times more
light.

107
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:12,431
Now you may say,
gee that's a violation of the

108
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,383
conservation of energy.
Three times more sources,

109
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:17,719
nine times more light,
how can that be,

110
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,469
well you overlook then that if
you make N go up by a factor of

111
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:25,121
three
that the lines get narrower by

112
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:27,76
a factor of three,
because of this N here,

113
00:07:27,76 --> 00:07:30,462
and so they get higher by a
factor of nine,

114
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:33,165
and they get narrower by a
factor of three,

115
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:35,868
and so you gain a factor of
three in light.

116
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:38,185
Of course you gain a factor of
three.

117
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:40,309
You have three times more
sources.

118
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:44,299
You get three times more light.
So you see there's no violation

119
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,487
of the conservation of energy
here.

120
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:50,283
And I want to demonstrate this
to you using a -- a red laser

121
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,823
which we have used before.
And I will use what we call a

122
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:57,985
grading,
a grading is a plate which is

123
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:00,985
specially prepared,
a transparent plate,

124
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:05,216
which has grooves in it,
and the one that I will use has

125
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:09,14
tw- twenty-five hundred grooves,
we call them lines,

126
00:08:09,14 --> 00:08:11,909
per inch.
That means the separation D

127
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:16,602
between two adjacent grooves in
my case is about two point one

128
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:19,679
six microns.
A micron is ten to the minus

129
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:22,603
six meters.
And the wavelength that I'm

130
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:28,49
going to use is our red laser,
which is about six point three

131
00:08:28,49 --> 00:08:31,231
times ten to the minus seven
meters.

132
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,519
And I'm going to put the whole
thing there.

133
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,434
I'm going to make you see it
there at a distance L.

134
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:42,662
Which is about ten meters.
And so this allows me now to

135
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:47,516
calculate where the zero order
will fall, where the first order

136
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:50,335
and where the second order will
fall.

137
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:54,014
We call when N is zero,
we call that zero order,

138
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:57,773
so this is zero order,
when N is one we call that

139
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:01,97
first order,
and when N is two we call that

140
00:09:01,97 --> 00:09:04,372
second order.
And you have of course the

141
00:09:04,372 --> 00:09:07,884
first order also on this side
and the second order also on

142
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:10,286
this side.
Everything that you have here

143
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:13,675
you have to also think of it as
being on the other side.

144
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:17,248
So I can predict now where the
zero order will be when N is

145
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:18,849
zero.
That is zero degrees.

146
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,745
That's immediately obvious.
I use that equation.

147
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:25,256
If N is zero the zero order is
always right at the center,

148
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:27,967
provided that all these sources
are in phase.

149
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:32,403
And they will be in phase
because I use plain waves.

150
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:36,395
So Huygens will tell you that
they're going to oscillate

151
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:40,459
exactly at the same time they
produce the same frequency,

152
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,161
they produce the same
wavelength, and they're all in

153
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:47,863
phase with each other.
So there will be a maximum at

154
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:51,202
theta one equals zero.
And then there will be a

155
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:55,266
maximum which I calculated to be
at three point five five

156
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:57,807
degrees.
I calculated that from this

157
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:02,234
equation and then theta two will
be at roughly seven point one

158
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,847
degrees.
If you want to know how wide

159
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:08,985
the width of this peak is going
to be,

160
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:14,307
then you have to know how many
lines of my grading I will be

161
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:17,375
using.
Well, my grading is like so.

162
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:22,698
Here I have these lines not
unlike the grading that you have

163
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:27,028
in your optics kit.
There are twenty-five hundred

164
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:31,72
of those lines per inch.
And my laser beam is roughly

165
00:10:31,72 --> 00:10:35,689
two millimeters in size.
So this is about two

166
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:40,652
millimeters.
And that tells me then that I

167
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:46,026
cover about two hundred lines.
And if I have two hundred lines

168
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:50,696
I can now calculate how wide
that line is going to be.

169
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:54,573
Because this factor of N enters
into it here.

170
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:59,508
And if I express that in terms
of that angle delta theta,

171
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:04,442
then the angle delta theta
going back here so delta theta

172
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:09,288
is then the three point five
five degrees divided by two

173
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:13,288
hundred,
and that's an extremely small

174
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:16,921
angle, that angle is
approximately one arc minute,

175
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:20,183
which is sixty times smaller
than one degree.

176
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:24,483
And if you want to translate
that in terms of how wide that

177
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,597
spot will be,
if I see it on the screen ten

178
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:31,155
meters away from me,
and if you want to call that

179
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:35,159
delta X, then you would naively
predict that delta X is

180
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,94
something like three
millimeters, and the reason why

181
00:11:38,94 --> 00:11:43,759
I say naively because you will
not see that it is

182
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,931
three millimeters,
it will be extremely narrow,

183
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:50,655
but it will be more than three
millimeters, because the

184
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,586
limiting factor is always the
divergence of my laser beam.

185
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:58,586
And so the divergence of my
laser beam is more than one arc

186
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:02,654
minute, and so I don't get down
to the one arc minute narrow

187
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:04,93
beam.
I'm not too far away from it

188
00:12:04,93 --> 00:12:07,482
though.
So this is what I want to show

189
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:10,24
you first.
I will turn on the laser first

190
00:12:10,24 --> 00:12:14,102
and then make it very dark
because we do need darkness or

191
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:17,61
this
has to come off because that

192
00:12:17,61 --> 00:12:21,11
would obviously -- oh,
I turned off the wrong laser,

193
00:12:21,11 --> 00:12:24,815
but that -- I turned on the
wrong laser, but that's OK.

194
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:28,658
That's a second demonstration
which I do with uh with the

195
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:32,501
green laser, this is the one
that I need, this is the red

196
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,697
laser, will come on very
quickly.

197
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:37,579
There it is.
Tom, if you can turn that off,

198
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:40,941
maybe that will help,
although everyone can see it

199
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:44,098
but it would help.
So you see here very clearly

200
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:47,76
the um
the zero order is at the m- at

201
00:12:47,76 --> 00:12:51,387
the -- right in the middle.
This one, so theta is zero,

202
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,679
and this theta one is my
three-and-a-half degrees,

203
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,164
this is also three-and-a-half
degrees.

204
00:12:57,164 --> 00:13:00,187
This is the seven point one
degrees and so on.

205
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:03,344
And so you see this whole
pattern of -- uh of uh

206
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:06,166
interference as a result of
multiple slits.

207
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:10,196
And so this is a -- these are
grooves in a piece of plastics.

208
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:15,235
And notice how small they are,
how narrow they are compared

209
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:18,148
with the double-slit
interference.

210
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:22,738
So they don't have that
theoretical minimum with this

211
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:27,859
one over N, but they approach
that, and the reason why they

212
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:33,332
are not that narrow is because
the divergence of the laser beam

213
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:38,541
itself is larger than that one
arc minute that I calculated.

214
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:42,072
And so you can never beat that
of course.

215
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:46,221
We did this experiment with
white,

216
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,345
with uh red light,
but keep in mind that if I take

217
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:52,085
red light, here is a maximum,
at zero order,

218
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:55,017
here is a maximum,
provided that this lambda is

219
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,12
lambda for red,
here is a maximum,

220
00:13:57,12 --> 00:13:59,67
provided that this is the
lambda for red.

221
00:13:59,67 --> 00:14:02,984
But if I have white light,
then of course I deal with

222
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:05,725
other colors.
And if I have blue light in my

223
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:08,593
white light, it will also have a
maximum here,

224
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:11,588
that's nonnegotiable,
but it has its first order

225
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:14,01
maximum here,
because the wavelength is

226
00:14:14,01 --> 00:14:16,241
shorter.
And it will have its second

227
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:18,846
order
maximum here.

228
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:22,571
This will be the same distance.
And so when you do this with

229
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:26,169
white light you're going to see
always at zero order white

230
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:29,642
light, because all the colors
have their maximum at zero

231
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:32,672
order, but at first and second
and higher orders,

232
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,334
the cor- the -- the -- the
colors uh walk at their own pace

233
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,606
so to speak.
And then the smaller the

234
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:42,457
wavelength is the closer it will
be to the zero order and then

235
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:46,372
the spacings between first and
second will also be smaller than

236
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:49,717
in the case of the long
wavelength,

237
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:52,666
in this case red.
And this is something that I

238
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:56,794
also want to demonstrate to you.
It is not so easy to get a very

239
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:59,218
strong powerful source of white
light.

240
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:02,101
I'm using for this a -- a
reflection grading.

241
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,657
You can also use gradings in
reflection.

242
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:08,391
You take metal and then the --
the grooves are made on the

243
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,423
metal.
And you get a reflection,

244
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,782
which we will have there on the
wall.

245
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:16,451
This reflection grading has a
spacing which is four times

246
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:19,923
smaller than the one we have
here.

247
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:23,238
It's only two-and-a-half
microns and so the angle of

248
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:26,617
theta one will not be
three-and-a-half degrees but it

249
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:30,322
will be four times larger.
The main purpose wh- why I want

250
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:34,156
to show you this is I use white
light that the zero order is

251
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:36,366
white.
And then we will see also of

252
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:40,07
course the first and the second
order if we have good eyes

253
00:15:40,07 --> 00:15:43,774
because the f- the -- the whole
thing is not so -- so very

254
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:46,244
bright.
Make sure that I have the -- my

255
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:49,364
light, flashlight,
so your eyes

256
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:53,311
may have to adjust a little bit
to the darkness.

257
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:58,434
The effect is not overpowering
because our light source is not

258
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,71
very bright.
But you see the where is my

259
00:16:01,71 --> 00:16:05,489
laser pointer,
this is the zero order maximum,

260
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:10,277
and the zero order maximum is
very wide, the reason is the

261
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:15,316
divergence of the white light
beam, it's not this factor of N

262
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:20,355
that I gain, I gain much less,
uh I can turn on

263
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:24,94
also a laser which I use at the
same time, and you will see that

264
00:16:24,94 --> 00:16:28,652
the red laser will give its own
th- there they come,

265
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:32,8
so the zero order of the red
laser is of course also here,

266
00:16:32,8 --> 00:16:36,511
all colors are here,
and then you see here the first

267
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:39,277
order of the red,
that's a large angle,

268
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:43,279
but the D is very small,
you see here the first order of

269
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,282
the red, second order of the
red, you see here the first

270
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:51,503
order of the blue,
first order of the blue,

271
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:55,464
you see a big difference,
between the separation of the

272
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:59,499
red and the separation from the
zero order and the blue,

273
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:03,388
it's a big difference.
There is actually a much better

274
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:07,79
way that I can make you see all
this and that is if I ask you

275
00:17:07,79 --> 00:17:11,678
which I think I'm going to do
now to use your grading,

276
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:14,026
but hold -- hold it for a
second.

277
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:17,254
Before you get your -- your own
gradings out.

278
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:21,363
Our equations that we have
derived so far

279
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:24,458
only hold if we look very far
away.

280
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:29,831
These angles of theta are only
true if you go very far away.

281
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:34,93
For reasons that we discussed
last time we can however do

282
00:17:34,93 --> 00:17:39,391
something very clever.
We can use a lens and if we

283
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:44,126
have a lens we can bring the
image very close without

284
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:48,041
disturbing the angles.
If this is a grading,

285
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:53,049
this is the number of sources
that I have,

286
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:58,48
and so the light comes in in
this direction and if I put here

287
00:17:58,48 --> 00:18:03,729
a lens and this is the screen,
the focal point of the lens,

288
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:08,798
then if the angle theta -- if
the angle theta for which I

289
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,414
would have expected in this
direction my first order

290
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:17,848
maximum, and here of course my
zero order maximum,

291
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:21,469
then the lens will not change
that angle.

292
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:27,01
We never discussed lenses so
it may not be so obvious to

293
00:18:27,01 --> 00:18:28,909
you.
But the lens will always

294
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,079
maintain the integrity of
angles.

295
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,672
So the angle theta that we
derived here is the correct

296
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:38,944
angle, but of course in terms of
X that is enormously reduced if

297
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:42,945
this distance is very small.
So then we have the option that

298
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:46,945
we don't have to allow for very
large distances like now ten

299
00:18:46,945 --> 00:18:49,319
meters.
And so your eye is a perfect

300
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,523
tool to use for that because you
have a lens in your -- in your

301
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:57,252
eye, that's the whole idea.
And so now I want you to get

302
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:59,873
your
gradings out.

303
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:04,15
And I want you to hold the
gradings in front of your eyes

304
00:19:04,15 --> 00:19:08,658
and manipulate the gradings a
little bit so that you get the

305
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:12,095
lines vertical.
And you will easily be able to

306
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:14,692
do that, this is your light
source.

307
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:18,588
Your lines, your gradings,
have a thousand lines per

308
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:21,72
millimeter.
That means the spacing of your

309
00:19:21,72 --> 00:19:25,769
grading is one micron.
One micron is ten times smaller

310
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:29,36
than this number.
So the angles are huge in your

311
00:19:29,36 --> 00:19:33,583
case.
They're way larger than what we

312
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,846
have there.
I will make it completely dark

313
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:41,621
and then I want you to rotate
your gradings such that you get

314
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:46,077
the spectra on either side,
on the left and on the right.

315
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:50,374
That means your grooves are
then in vertical direction.

316
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:55,387
And what you see now way better
than what I could show you in my

317
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:59,525
previous demonstration,
you see the zero order is the

318
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:03,522
lamp itself.
All the colors are right at the

319
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:04,952
center.
That's the lamp.

320
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:08,682
That's your zero order maximum.
And then you see if you go to

321
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:11,977
the right you see the blue
coming in beautifully first

322
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,645
because that's the smallest
wavelength, you're going further

323
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:18,195
to the right,
you see the first order red,

324
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:21,801
you're going further to the
right, you see the second order

325
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:25,407
blue, you go further to the
right, and you see second order

326
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:28,577
red, but since D is so amazingly
small in your case,

327
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:31,251
there may not be too many
maxima in the red.

328
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:36,43
In fact I will ask you on
one of the homework assignments

329
00:20:36,43 --> 00:20:41,039
which is the optional one how
many maxima in the red you will

330
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,574
see.
So essential here is that you

331
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:47,876
see that the f- zero order
maximum at the center is white

332
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:50,564
light.
And so it's not until you get

333
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:54,943
to first and second order that
you begin to see the colors

334
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,939
separate.
Now these gradings can be used

335
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:01,779
to do atomic physics.
There are atoms and molecules

336
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:05,851
uh which emit very discrete
frequencies, very discrete

337
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:10,331
wavelength.
And when you look at them with

338
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:14,387
a grading you can see very
distinctly where these lines

339
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,94
fall.
Where these wavelengths fall.

340
00:21:16,94 --> 00:21:20,169
And that's the next thing that
I want to do.

341
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:24
I will show you now,
I will turn off the white light

342
00:21:24 --> 00:21:26,853
source and I will turn on for
you neon.

343
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:31,059
And so I want you to look now
at the neon and if you give

344
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,039
yourself some time you will see
that the neon is not a

345
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,596
continuous spectrum like you saw
with the white light bulb

346
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:43,982
but you see very distinct
locations where you see maxima.

347
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:47,248
You see many in the red,
and I think you see several in

348
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:50,936
the orange, and I noticed this
morning that I see two lines in

349
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,415
the green.
You have to look very carefully

350
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:56,257
because these lines in the green
are very faint.

351
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:59,884
And so the whole purpose then
is that with these gradings you

352
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:03,452
can not only find out which
wavelengths are emitted by these

353
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:07,019
atoms and these molecules but
you can also find the relative

354
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:10,708
strength, and that is of course
entering the

355
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,782
domain of atomic physics.
And these gradings are

356
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:17,772
extremely powerful to do that.
And I would advise you to carry

357
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:21,893
these gradings with you at least
for the next few weeks and when

358
00:22:21,893 --> 00:22:25,817
you're outside and you get a
chance to see some bright lights

359
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:29,219
out on highways or on the
street, to look through the

360
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:32,882
grading and see whether you can
see these emission lines,

361
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:36,806
uh mercury if you get mercury
lamps, they are very beautiful.

362
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:39,881
You see many many different
colors very discrete

363
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,544
frequencies, very discrete
wavelengths,

364
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:48,58
are emitted by mercury in the
same way, the same kind of

365
00:22:48,58 --> 00:22:52,976
physics that you see that here
with um with neon.

366
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:58,197
So now comes something that may
come as a surprise to you.

367
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:02,776
Because now I would like to
discuss with you um the

368
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:06,897
interference pattern if we have
only one slit.

369
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:10,926
We discussed two,
we discussed capital N is a

370
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:15,178
large number,
but what now if we have only

371
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,782
one slit?
Even if you have only one slit

372
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:21,589
there will be directions in
space whereby light plus light

373
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:24,461
gives darkness,
and there will be directions

374
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:28,401
whereby the light constructively
interferes with each other.

375
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:31,808
And strangely enough this is
given a different name.

376
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:35,481
We call this diffraction.
It's exactly the same physics.

377
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:38,753
There is no difference.
It should have been called

378
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:41,625
interference,
but it's in the literature you

379
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,163
will see it under the name
diffraction.

380
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:47,836
It all comes down again to
Huygens'

381
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:50,757
principle.
So let me here now have a

382
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:55,848
single opening and this opening
is a slit perpendicular to the

383
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:59,102
blackboard and the opening is A
in size.

384
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:02,774
A single one.
And the plain waves come in and

385
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,278
Mr.
Huygens says that all these

386
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,452
sources here are all going to be
emitting the light at the same

387
00:24:10,452 --> 00:24:15,459
frequency, the same wavelength,
and they will all be in phase

388
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:20,215
with each other.
Because these plain waves

389
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:22,685
arrive here all at the same
time.

390
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:27,161
And so I could now ask myself
the question at what angle of

391
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:31,406
theta will I see maximum,
what angle of theta will I see

392
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:36,268
minimum, and you can also put a
screen then at large distance L,

393
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:40,975
you can call X equals zero here
and you can ask yourself where

394
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:45,374
will I see these maxima and
where will I see these minima?

395
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:48,384
To derive this in this case is
not easy.

396
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,776
Again I refer to eight oh
three.

397
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:55,561
It's as difficult as
deriving in this case this

398
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:58,307
whole structure in between the
maxima.

399
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:02,834
One thing is obvious and that
is that you got to get a maximum

400
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,099
that is nonnegotiable when theta
equals zero.

401
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:09,736
That's simply a matter of
symmetry of the problem.

402
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:13,966
If all these sources are in
phase, clearly you're going to

403
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:17,306
get a maximum here.
No one will question that.

404
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:21,536
The minima is very tricky.
And the minima will fall at the

405
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:26,583
following locations.
The sine of theta of N equals N

406
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:29,837
times lambda divided by A.
And for small angle

407
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:33,02
approximation,
this is the same as theta N in

408
00:25:33,02 --> 00:25:35,769
radians.
And when you see that equation

409
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:40,109
your first reaction should be
that maybe I goofed by a factor

410
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,568
of two.
Because your first reaction

411
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:47,053
will be that's the same equation
that we have there and then we

412
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:50,163
have D there,
and so how can we have minimum

413
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:54,069
here where we have maxima there?
Well, the situation is

414
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:56,89
different.
The best way that you can see

415
00:25:56,89 --> 00:26:00,818
that
that equation is not wrong is

416
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:04,567
perhaps the following.
Suppose you take the angle

417
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:07,457
theta one.
So that's for N equals one.

418
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:12,065
Then the relation that you see
there will tell you that this

419
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:16,439
source here, this Huygens
source, and this Huygens source

420
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:19,719
have a difference in path length
of lambda.

421
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:23,389
And so you will then say aha
that's constructive

422
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:25,342
interference,
that's true,

423
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:29,97
but that means this
Huygens source and this Huygens

424
00:26:29,97 --> 00:26:32,965
source will then have a
difference in path of half

425
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,165
lambda.
So they will kill each other.

426
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:38,648
And that means this Huygens
source and this Huygens source

427
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:42,071
will have a difference in path
length of one-half lambda.

428
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:44,087
So they will also kill each
other.

429
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:47,693
And so in this upper half there
is always one Huygens source

430
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:49,954
which will kill the one at the
bottom.

431
00:26:49,954 --> 00:26:53,193
And you can do a similar
reasoning for the angle theta

432
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:54,966
two.
And so that is indeed the

433
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:58,633
correct equation.
You will find complete

434
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:03,326
minima when theta one in terms
of radians is lambda divided by

435
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:07,327
A and theta two is two lambda
divided by A and so on.

436
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:09,866
That's where you find your
minima.

437
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:14,405
And if you convert that into X
where they actually fall on a

438
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:19,252
screen, well then X one will be
for small angle approximations L

439
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:22,792
times lambda divided by A.
That's no different.

440
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:25,715
And so now what I owe you is a
pattern.

441
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:28,1
What will the pattern look
like?

442
00:27:28,1 --> 00:27:31,871
When I look on the screen
there,

443
00:27:31,871 --> 00:27:35,226
what will I really see?
Well, it's looking,

444
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:39,22
it's going to look very
different from what you may

445
00:27:39,22 --> 00:27:42,096
think.
I will plot it now in terms of

446
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,333
X.
I could have plotted it in

447
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,688
terms of theta.
But I decided to plot it in

448
00:27:47,688 --> 00:27:50,963
terms of X.
So here at X equals zero there

449
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,28
is unmistakable,
unnegotiable,

450
00:27:53,28 --> 00:27:57,194
there is a maximum,
that is -- that coincides with

451
00:27:57,194 --> 00:28:01,108
theta equals zero.
And then here at lambda divided

452
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:05,981
by A, completely destructive
interference,

453
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:09,005
that's that angle theta one uh
times L.

454
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:12,745
And then here L two lambda
divided by A complete

455
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:17,599
destructive interference and the
same is true of course on the

456
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,702
other side.
And what you're going to see

457
00:28:20,702 --> 00:28:24,919
now in terms of the intensity
that I showed you there,

458
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,898
watts per square meters,
is a curve that looks like

459
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:31,444
this.
You get an enormously broad

460
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:36,329
maximum, absolutely zero here,
very small maximum,

461
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:39,694
absolutely zero there,
very small maximum and zero

462
00:28:39,694 --> 00:28:42,51
there, and this continues for a
long time.

463
00:28:42,51 --> 00:28:46,286
And this is very different from
anything we've seen with

464
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:49,239
multiple sources.
If the intensity here is I

465
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:53,085
zero, then the maximum here
which I didn't even calculate

466
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:56,93
where it is, it is somewhere in
between these two minima,

467
00:28:56,93 --> 00:28:59,952
but I didn't calculate
precisely where it is,

468
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:03,385
that maximum is very low,
it's only four point five

469
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:08,329
percent in strength of I zero.
And this is even lower.

470
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,006
This is only one point six
percent of I zero.

471
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:15,431
So when you look at a
diffraction pattern,

472
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:19,107
we call this a diffraction
pattern like this,

473
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:23,786
you will see a very broad
center maximum and then you see

474
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:28,715
these dark spots on either side,
and you see light coming up

475
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:32,057
again in between them,
sort of submaxima.

476
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:36,318
And so the width of this center
maximum, this width,

477
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:41,279
which is really X one,
that width is then L lambda

478
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,435
divided by A and if you want to
be picky and you say well the

479
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:48,621
center maximum is really twice
that much, fine,

480
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,46
be my guest,
but this is clearly a measure

481
00:29:51,46 --> 00:29:55,408
for how wide that center spot
will be when you see it on a

482
00:29:55,408 --> 00:29:57,901
screen.
And now there comes something

483
00:29:57,901 --> 00:30:01,918
that is completely not intuitive
for you as well as for me.

484
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:05,935
And that is if you make A very
small that means you let the

485
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:09,951
light go through an extremely
narrow slit,

486
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:13,907
then this what you will see on
the wall is extremely wide.

487
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:16,474
The smaller A is the wider it
will be.

488
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:19,666
It's exactly opposed to what
you would predict.

489
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:23,83
You would think if you make the
opening through which you put

490
00:30:23,83 --> 00:30:27,022
light very small,
you would think that what you

491
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:29,52
see on the screen is also very
small.

492
00:30:29,52 --> 00:30:33,267
It's exactly the opposite.
And that's is what I want to

493
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:36,459
demonstrate to you.
I have here a demonstration

494
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,818
with a variable slit.
I can vary A.

495
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:42,936
And we will use
the brightest laser that we

496
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:46,714
have, a beam of green laser
light, about five thousand four

497
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:49,711
hundred Angstroms.
And what I will do is I will

498
00:30:49,711 --> 00:30:53,098
make this opening narrower and
narrower and narrower.

499
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:55,964
And as I make the opening I
start very large.

500
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:59,482
I start with a large opening of
maybe five millimeters.

501
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:03,064
At a large opening A is so
large that this is negligibly

502
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:06,842
small because A is very large,
then this is not very large,

503
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:09,839
this is very small.
But as I make A smaller and

504
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,847
smaller and smaller and
smaller there comes a time that

505
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:19,523
the diffraction width is going
to be dominating the whole scene

506
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:24,123
and what you will see then on
the screen there that the bright

507
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:26,612
spot will get wider,
wider, wider,

508
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:29,176
wider.
And that for me is always so

509
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:33,776
enormously fascinating because
it goes so strongly against our

510
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:36,868
intuition.
And so this is what I have next

511
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:40,111
on the menu.
I have here this variable slit.

512
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:46,144
I must make sure that I have my
flashlight and I'll turn on this

513
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:49,95
laser that I earlier
accidentally turned on.

514
00:31:49,95 --> 00:31:52,782
I hope it's coming on.
Yes it is.

515
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:56,853
And so you see there the slit
is now very wide.

516
00:31:56,853 --> 00:32:01,986
And so the size of that slit
that you see there -- the size

517
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:07,207
of the -- of the bright spot is
now entirely dictated by the

518
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:11,809
divergence of my laser beam.
The diffraction width is

519
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,349
negligibly small because A is
very large.

520
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:19,42
But now watch.
Now I'm going to

521
00:32:19,42 --> 00:32:22,947
tighten, make A smaller.
And I'm doing that now.

522
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:25,424
I'm making it smaller and
smaller.

523
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:28,502
The diffraction width is still
negligible.

524
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:30,078
Making it smaller.
Ah.

525
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:32,705
I'm beginning to see the dark
lines.

526
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:35,257
Ah.
The diffraction width is taking

527
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:37,659
over.
Look at the center maximum.

528
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,986
Right there.
It's getting wider.

529
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:43,589
It's getting wider.
And I make the slit narrower.

530
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,442
It's getting wider.
It's getting wider.

531
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:51,043
Look how beautiful you see
these destructive

532
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:53,694
interferences.
Where light plus light gives

533
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:54,641
darkness.
Wider.

534
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,787
Wider.
Right now it is at least ten

535
00:32:56,787 --> 00:33:00,386
times wider than it was before.
And now it is twenty times

536
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:02,217
wider.
And it gets very faint.

537
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:05,941
Of course it gets very faint
because if I make the slit very

538
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:09,476
narrow not much light goes
through, there's nothing I can

539
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:11,812
do about it.
But notice how incredibly

540
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:14,779
impressive this is.
How wide that center maximum

541
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:17,241
becomes.
And that is very characteristic

542
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:20,208
for diffraction.
The narrower the slit the wider

543
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:25,272
the diffraction
pattern at the center maximum.

544
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:30,735
Now I did this in monochromatic
light, monochromatic light means

545
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:34,637
that you have practically only
one wavelength.

546
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:39,84
And there is a way that I can
make you see this from your own

547
00:33:39,84 --> 00:33:43,049
seats.
And that is what we're going to

548
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:46,778
do with the um with the cards
that you have.

549
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:53,194
So if you can get the cards out
now, we did this in one color,

550
00:33:53,194 --> 00:33:55,752
right, in green light,
almost one color,

551
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:59,096
almost monochromatic,
so you see a beautiful pattern

552
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:01,325
here, very well-defined dark
lines.

553
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:04,341
You now can use this little
slit that you have,

554
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:08,078
put it in front of your eye,
and I'm going to make you see

555
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:12,143
this white light and you would
see all the features that you're

556
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:16,077
supposed to see but it's even
more interesting in white light

557
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:19,093
because with white light you
have a little red,

558
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:22,241
you have a little blue,
you have a little yellow,

559
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:25,585
and so these minima will fall
at

560
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:29,282
different locations of course.
And so you don't see it as

561
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:32,979
beautiful as I showed you,
as distinct as I showed you in

562
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:36,412
green, but you see very
distinctly the center maximum

563
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:39,119
and you see the dark lines on
either side.

564
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,081
But the main reason why I want
you to see this is that if you

565
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,778
manage to manipulate the size of
the slit, the size of A,

566
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:50,673
if you manage to manipulate
that, when you make it narrower,

567
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:54,569
notice that the diffraction
pattern gets broader and not the

568
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:58,761
other way around.
So first make sure that you get

569
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:02,594
it, that you begin to see the
dark areas, and then try to make

570
00:35:02,594 --> 00:35:05,987
it a little narrower and then
you see that it opens up.

571
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:09,506
This is precisely what I did
with the variable slit here.

572
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:13,401
So give it a d- b- bit of time.
What helps me that actually you

573
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:17,108
don't have to pull it open but
yet you can move one piece of

574
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,878
the card behind the other card.
So your one thumb goes to the

575
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:23,58
back and the other your thumb
comes forward.

576
00:35:23,58 --> 00:35:27,853
That works very well for me.
Who can see clearly the

577
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:30,891
diffraction pattern?
Unmistakably.

578
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:33,93
Very good.
Take the card with you,

579
00:35:33,93 --> 00:35:38,718
impress your parents.
And look at home at very bright

580
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:43,874
street lights and you will still
see the same diffraction

581
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:47,189
pattern.
Although not as ideal as you

582
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:52,806
see it here because our source
is a line source and that helps

583
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:57,226
of course if your slit if
vertical.

584
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:59,454
OK.
If I don't have a slit as an

585
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:03,838
opening but if I have a circular
opening then the pattern that

586
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,006
you would expect is the same
that you see here but you have

587
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:11,887
to rotate it about this line
because you now have axial

588
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:14,618
symmetry.
So you don't have a -- a long

589
00:36:14,618 --> 00:36:17,277
slit, but you have a circular
opening.

590
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:20,152
And indeed that is
approximately correct.

591
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:24,393
If you had a circular opening
you would see a center maximum

592
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:28,418
which would be very bright and
then you

593
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:31,165
would see rings around it of
zeroes.

594
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:35,719
And so if I try to make you see
it this would be the center

595
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:38,545
maximum.
It would be a ring around it

596
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:40,979
here.
Complete darkness and then

597
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:44,277
again a little bit of light,
not very much,

598
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:48,752
because remember that this
maximum is only four-and-a-half

599
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:52,677
percent of that one.
And then you would see again a

600
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,582
ring with complete darkness and
so on.

601
00:36:55,582 --> 00:37:00,842
So you have a little pinhole
and this is the image

602
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:05,197
that you would get on a screen.
From that pinhole.

603
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:10,441
And you would think now that
this angle from here to here is

604
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:14,795
this theta equals zero and we
call that theta one.

605
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:19,328
This is the theta one where you
see your first zero,

606
00:37:19,328 --> 00:37:24,571
you would think that that is
lambda divided by A if A is the

607
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:28,837
diameter of your pinhole.
Well, it's almost that.

608
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:32,836
It is a little larger.
Because a

609
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:36,395
pinhole, a circular geometry is
different from a line.

610
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:40,49
And so take my word for it that
it comes not at lambda divided

611
00:37:40,49 --> 00:37:44,652
by A but it comes at roughly one
point two lambda divided by A.

612
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:48,546
If you want to be picky it's
really one point two two times

613
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:52,44
lambda divided by A and this of
course is in radians again.

614
00:37:52,44 --> 00:37:56,065
I work now exclusively in terms
of radians, small angle

615
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,086
approximation.
And so this raises the issue of

616
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:01,906
what we call in physics angular
resolution.

617
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:05,396
Suppose I have a pinhole and I
look

618
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:07,382
at the images of two light
sources.

619
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:10,652
One light comes in from there
and the other comes in from

620
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:14,215
there, could be the headlights
of a car, could be two stars in

621
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:16,668
the sky, well,
each one of them will give a

622
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:19,062
diffraction pattern,
that's nonnegotiable,

623
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:20,931
you can never bypass
diffraction.

624
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,734
So one star will give a
diffraction pattern here,

625
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,187
or one headlight,
and the other will give a

626
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:29,282
diffraction pattern here.
You would have no problem to

627
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:30,742
say oh, yeah,
they're all,

628
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:34,012
there are two light sources,
there's one star and there's

629
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,089
another
star.

630
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:38,233
OK.
Now make the angle between the

631
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:42,261
two sources smaller and smaller
and smaller and smaller so that

632
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:46,289
these two diffraction patterns
come close and closer and closer

633
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:48,758
and closer.
How close can you now bring

634
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:51,486
them so that we,
you and I, will still say,

635
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:53,63
yeah, there are still two
sources?

636
00:38:53,63 --> 00:38:55,644
We call that angular
resolution.

637
00:38:55,644 --> 00:38:59,347
And so how we define angular
resolution is that both light

638
00:38:59,347 --> 00:39:03,115
sources have exactly the same
strength and let's assume for

639
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:07,487
now for simplicity that they're
monochromatic,

640
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:11,268
so that there's only one
wavelength that they emit.

641
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:15,426
Then the criterion that is
generally accepted so that we

642
00:39:15,426 --> 00:39:19,131
can still decide that there are
two light sources,

643
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:21,929
that this one,
the center of this one,

644
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:26,239
is no closer than the location
where this one has complete

645
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,053
darkness.
In other words,

646
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:32,136
the spot of the second star
should fall right where the

647
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:37,353
other one has darkness.
If you bring them closer your

648
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:41,271
brains will say no.
No, no, that's not two sources.

649
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:45,895
That's really only one source.
And we call this the Rayleigh

650
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:50,126
criterion of resolution.
And that Rayleigh criterion of

651
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:55,141
resolution therefore is that the
separation between the two light

652
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:59,843
beams, stars or the headlights
from a car, the separation has

653
00:39:59,843 --> 00:40:04,152
to be larger than this angle.
And it is a function of A.

654
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,914
If A is larger,
then that angle can

655
00:40:07,914 --> 00:40:12,058
be substantially smaller.
And this is what we call the

656
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:15,498
diffraction limitation on
angular resolution.

657
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:20,034
It doesn't matter whether you
have a pinhole or whether you

658
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:24,569
have a lens a c- circular lens
that we use with telescopes.

659
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:28,713
Or whether you have concave
mirrors, which we use with

660
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:31,685
telescopes.
In all cases are you always

661
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:36,064
stuck with the idea at best,
that's the best you can ever

662
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:40,755
do, that is the angular
separation that theta

663
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:46,045
I call it here the theta one,
is that one point two lambda

664
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:49,851
divided by A,
and that is then in radians.

665
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:55,233
If you take a lens which has
the diameter A of about twenty

666
00:40:55,233 --> 00:41:00,987
centimeters then that translates
into a theta one of about half

667
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:04,885
an arc second,
for five thousand Angstroms.

668
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:10,547
So I take lambda five thousand
Angstroms, remember an Angstrom

669
00:41:10,547 --> 00:41:14,442
is ten to the
minus ten meters.

670
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:18,278
So theta one then becomes half
an arc second.

671
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:23,074
Oh point five arc seconds.
An arc minute is one-sixtieth

672
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:26,997
of a d- arc degree,
and an arc second is sixty

673
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:31,619
times lower than that.
And so if A were two point four

674
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:35,891
meters, telescope,
two point four meter telescope,

675
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:39,727
that's a real biggie,
then theta one would be

676
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:43,779
approximately
one-twenty-fifth of an arc

677
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:45,999
second.
So the larger you make your

678
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:49,524
telescope the better angular
resolution you would have.

679
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:53,115
This angular resolution is
twelve times better than this

680
00:41:53,115 --> 00:41:55,008
one.
Because A is twelve times

681
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:57,293
larger.
So now you may think that if

682
00:41:57,293 --> 00:42:01,341
you take a two point four meter
telescope on the ground and you

683
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:05,258
look at stars that two stars
equally bright you would be able

684
00:42:05,258 --> 00:42:09,044
to tell them apart if they are
farther away from each other

685
00:42:09,044 --> 00:42:11,525
than one-twenty-fifth of an arc
second.

686
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:14,855
That is not true.
The contrary.

687
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:17,919
It is very bad.
You can't even tell them apart

688
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:20,575
often when they are half a
second apart.

689
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:24,729
And the reason for that is not
that the diffraction limitation

690
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:28,202
is going to kill you,
but the reason is that the air

691
00:42:28,202 --> 00:42:31,675
is always turbulent.
And it is the turbulence on the

692
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:35,421
air that makes the image,
the diffraction-limited image,

693
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:38,553
which itself is very small,
move around on your

694
00:42:38,553 --> 00:42:41,958
photographic plates,
it moves it around in a matter

695
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:45,364
of ten seconds over an area
which

696
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:47,512
itself could be as large as one
second.

697
00:42:47,512 --> 00:42:50,736
Astronomers call that seeing.
And so when you look at your

698
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:53,903
picture, the whole star is
smeared out over an area which

699
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,9
is in angular size one arc
second or maybe half an arc

700
00:42:56,9 --> 00:42:59,388
second at best.
So you can never achieve this

701
00:42:59,388 --> 00:43:01,763
from the ground.
So all telescopes from the

702
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:05,043
ground without exception can do
at best half an arc second.

703
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:08,21
They cannot do much better
because of the air turbulence.

704
00:43:08,21 --> 00:43:11,208
And this is now the great thing
about the Hubble space

705
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:12,848
telescope.
Hubble is up there,

706
00:43:12,848 --> 00:43:16,128
or maybe down there,
whichever it is,

707
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:19,525
I don't know where it is,
maybe Jeffrey knows where it

708
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:22,473
is, but it is somewhere.
And Hubble has no air.

709
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:25,678
And so Hubble doesn't suffer of
the air turbulence.

710
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:29,14
And so Hubble's mirrors are
indeed diffraction-limited.

711
00:43:29,14 --> 00:43:32,537
And Hubble has a mirror which
is two point four meters

712
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:34,844
diameter.
And indeed at five thousand

713
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:38,37
Angstrom, I checked that
yesterday with people at Hubble

714
00:43:38,37 --> 00:43:40,421
space telescope,
indeed Hubble is

715
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:43,305
diffraction-limited,
and Hubble has an angular

716
00:43:43,305 --> 00:43:46,639
resolution at five thousand
Angstroms, which is about

717
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,249
one-twenty-fifth of
an arc second.

718
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:53,537
And at shorter wavelengths,
it's even better,

719
00:43:53,537 --> 00:43:57,049
and at longer wavelengths,
it is a little worse.

720
00:43:57,049 --> 00:44:01,607
And so I would like to show you
at least one picture of Hubble

721
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:06,016
without going into the details
of what you are seeing of the

722
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:09,753
astro- of the astronomy.
And that's the one that is

723
00:44:09,753 --> 00:44:12,817
coming up.
It's a very famous picture that

724
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:17,3
Hubble made several years ago.
It is a picture of a supernova

725
00:44:17,3 --> 00:44:20,29
explosion.
John if we can have the slide,

726
00:44:20,29 --> 00:44:24,084
there it is.
You're looking here at an

727
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:27,561
explosion, it's called Supernova
nineteen eighty-seven A,

728
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:30,728
which occurred in February of
nineteen eighty-seven.

729
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:34,453
This object is a hundred fifty
thousand light-years away from

730
00:44:34,453 --> 00:44:36,564
us.
That means the explosion really

731
00:44:36,564 --> 00:44:39,917
took place -- took place a
hundred fifty thousand years

732
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:41,842
ago.
But we saw it for the first

733
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:45,319
time in February eighty-seven.
And without going into the

734
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:48,858
details of what you're looking
at, which is of course very

735
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:51,777
fascinating, but that's not the
objective today,

736
00:44:51,777 --> 00:44:55,13
I want you to appreciate that
this

737
00:44:55,13 --> 00:44:57,1
distance here is one arc
second.

738
00:44:57,1 --> 00:45:00,785
And look at the incredible
detail that Hubble can show you.

739
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:04,789
If you took a picture like this
with a ground-based observatory,

740
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:07,331
this whole part would just be
one smudge.

741
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:09,682
You would not be able to
resolve that.

742
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:13,368
And that is the power that you
see in front of you now of a

743
00:45:13,368 --> 00:45:17,244
diffraction-limited telescope
which -- which has a diameter of

744
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:20,485
two point four meters.
You get an angular resolution

745
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:23,599
which is very close to
four-hundredths of a an arc

746
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,518
second.
The amount of detail that you

747
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:30,566
see is incredible.
That's the big power,

748
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:34,473
the big reason why this
telescope was put in orbit,

749
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:39,006
to do away with the um air
turbulence, what the astronomers

750
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:42,601
call as seeing.
Which is always a limitation of

751
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:46,352
your angular resolution.
So in the remaining five

752
00:45:46,352 --> 00:45:51,041
minutes I want to address the
issue of the angular resolution

753
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:54,636
of your own eye.
You can now calculate what the

754
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:59,559
ultimate angular resolution is
of your own eye.

755
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:03,269
Because you can estimate what
the diameter is of the pupil.

756
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:05,955
The opening of your eye.
Three millimeters,

757
00:46:05,955 --> 00:46:09,217
maybe five millimeters,
a little bit larger at night

758
00:46:09,217 --> 00:46:11,199
when it is dark.
Pupil opens up.

759
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,31
But we can calculate what this
is.

760
00:46:13,31 --> 00:46:16,635
Uh if I take four millimeters,
so I put in for A four

761
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:20,281
millimeters, and if I take
lambda five thousand Angstroms,

762
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:23,862
it's not an unreasonable value,
then I find that the best

763
00:46:23,862 --> 00:46:27,38
angular resolution of a human
eye is half an arc minute.

764
00:46:27,38 --> 00:46:31,92
Cannot be any better.
There's just no way around it.

765
00:46:31,92 --> 00:46:35,151
You're always stuck with the
diffraction limitation.

766
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:39,078
I think though that most of you
will not be able to see with an

767
00:46:39,078 --> 00:46:41,676
angular resolution of one-half
arc minute.

768
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:45,223
Most of you are probably in the
domain of one arc minute.

769
00:46:45,223 --> 00:46:48,073
It's a little larger than
diffraction-limited.

770
00:46:48,073 --> 00:46:51,621
But it's very close to that.
And that is something that I

771
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:54,661
would like to test.
Not to see how good your eyes

772
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:58,525
are, but for yourself to get a
feeling for angular resolution.

773
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:02,579
And the way I'm going to do
that is as follows.

774
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:07,198
We have prepared a box which
Marcos is going to wheel in very

775
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:10,354
shortly which has two pinholes
at the top.

776
00:47:10,354 --> 00:47:14,357
And these two pinholes are
two-and-a-half millimeters

777
00:47:14,357 --> 00:47:17,205
apart.
And then there are two pinholes

778
00:47:17,205 --> 00:47:19,668
which are five millimeters
apart.

779
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:24,518
And then there are two pinholes
which are ten millimeters apart.

780
00:47:24,518 --> 00:47:29,137
And then there are two pinholes
which are fifteen millimeters

781
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,908
apart.
So maybe we can take a look at

782
00:47:31,908 --> 00:47:33,447
that.
There it comes.

783
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:38,274
Thank you Marcos.
Here are two pinholes which are

784
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:40,396
two-and-a-half millimeters
apart.

785
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:42,85
We repeat the whole thing three
times.

786
00:47:42,85 --> 00:47:46,829
And the reason why we do that
is so that the different angles

787
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:50,874
in the audience you can probably
always see two pinholes well.

788
00:47:50,874 --> 00:47:54,72
What am I going to do now to
test the angular resolution of

789
00:47:54,72 --> 00:47:57,306
your eyes?
If I make the assumption that

790
00:47:57,306 --> 00:48:00,688
your angular resolution is one
arc minute, no worse,

791
00:48:00,688 --> 00:48:04,535
no better, remember it can
never be better than half an arc

792
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:07,498
minute,
that's nonnegotiable.

793
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:10,046
But it could be worse than one
arc minute.

794
00:48:10,046 --> 00:48:13,278
That would mean that all
students who are closer than

795
00:48:13,278 --> 00:48:16,945
nine meters from me should be
able to see this as two indep-

796
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:20,488
independent light sources.
Those who are farther than nine

797
00:48:20,488 --> 00:48:23,782
meters away from me will not see
these as two sources.

798
00:48:23,782 --> 00:48:27,262
If they did their angular
resolution would be better than

799
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:29,811
one arc minute.
And all students which are

800
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:33,105
closer than seventeen meters
will be able to say yeah,

801
00:48:33,105 --> 00:48:36,399
I see these as two sources,
and all students which are

802
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:41,683
closer than thirty-four meters
should be able to say yeah,

803
00:48:41,683 --> 00:48:46,278
I see these as two sources.
And so we're now going to make

804
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:49,664
it a little darker.
And you don't need your

805
00:48:49,664 --> 00:48:54,502
gradings, you don't need these
cards, I just want you to look

806
00:48:54,502 --> 00:48:57,243
at the lights,
these light sources,

807
00:48:57,243 --> 00:49:01,838
and then tell me which you're
going to see as two separate

808
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,466
light sources.
And that then allows me to tell

809
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:09,335
you very roughly what your
angular resolution is.

810
00:49:09,335 --> 00:49:15,126
So try to look at them.
And so now my first question is

811
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:19,565
who can see the upper,
either here or there or there,

812
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:23,406
they're the same,
who can clearly see those as

813
00:49:23,406 --> 00:49:25,625
two light sources?
Come on.

814
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:28,527
Come on.
You don't see them as two?

815
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:31,686
Something wrong,
is the lights not on?

816
00:49:31,686 --> 00:49:35,271
You must be kidding.
Are all of you sick or

817
00:49:35,271 --> 00:49:38,6
something?
Oh man I have no difficulties

818
00:49:38,6 --> 00:49:41,417
at all.
The upper one is two light

819
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:45,734
sources.
You've all got to see an eye

820
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:48,581
doctor.
OK, who sees the second line as

821
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:51,128
two?
Who sees the third line as two

822
00:49:51,128 --> 00:49:54,349
but not the second?
You see how interesting,

823
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:58,02
just look around you,
you see we're moving back in

824
00:49:58,02 --> 00:50:01,016
the audience.
Who sees the -- who can see

825
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:04,013
none of them at two -- two light
sources?

826
00:50:04,013 --> 00:50:07,759
OK, so maybe not -- no eye
doctors are needed then.

827
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:11,205
Who can only see the third line
as two sources,

828
00:50:11,205 --> 00:50:15,816
only the third line?
OK, well, I expect that,

829
00:50:15,816 --> 00:50:19,417
you see, no -- yeah,
maybe your angular resolution

830
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:21,916
is not very -- do you wear
glasses?

831
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:24,121
So you -- yeah,
I'm asking you,

832
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,694
so you see the third line as
double?

833
00:50:26,694 --> 00:50:30,663
And not the second line?
Yeah, there's nothing to worry

834
00:50:30,663 --> 00:50:33,456
about, maybe two arc minute
resolution.

835
00:50:33,456 --> 00:50:36,837
So now you have tested your
angular resolution.

836
00:50:36,837 --> 00:50:40,806
When you think of diffraction
it's really an incredibly

837
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:45,289
fascinating thing because what
this diffraction actually means

838
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:49,926
that it is a
limitation that is put upon us,

839
00:50:49,926 --> 00:50:52,799
on everyone,
also God, no one can bypass

840
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,746
diffraction.
No matter how hard we try we

841
00:50:55,746 --> 00:51:00,167
can never undo our chains and
handcuffs that are imposed upon

842
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:03,704
us by diffraction.
And remember it's all Huygens'

843
00:51:03,704 --> 00:51:05,988
fault.
But let's forgive Huygens

844
00:51:05,988 --> 51:11
because after all he was Dutch.
