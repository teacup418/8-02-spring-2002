1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
I'd like to thank you for your
evaluations.

2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03,883
I'd like to thank you for your
evaluations.

3
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:09,246
They were very useful to me.
I already sent e-mail to about

4
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:14,795
fifty students and I had some
interesting exchanges with some

5
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:18,308
of you.
Many of you are very happy with

6
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:22,192
their recitation instructors.
That's great.

7
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:26,076
Many are moderately happy.
Maybe that's OK.

8
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:30,33
But there are quite a few who
are

9
00:00:30,33 --> 00:00:33,805
very happy with their
recitation instructors.

10
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:38,15
If you are very unhappy with
your recitation instructor,

11
00:00:38,15 --> 00:00:42,416
you are complete idiots if you
stay in that recitation.

12
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:46,839
We have thirteen recitation
instructors, and I can assure

13
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:51,737
you that it will be very easy to
find one that agrees with you,

14
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:54,976
and you can come and see me if
that helps.

15
00:00:54,976 --> 00:01:00,743
Some are better than others.
That's the way it goes in life.

16
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:04,875
Some students would like to see
more cut-and-dried problem

17
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:08,355
solving in my lectures.
I think that's really the

18
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:11,981
domain of recitations.
Lectures and recitations are

19
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:13,866
complementary.
In lectures,

20
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,419
I prefer to go over the
concepts and I always give

21
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:21,769
numerical examples to support
the concepts -- in a way that's

22
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,684
problem solving -- and I show
demonstrations to further

23
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:28,222
support the concept,
because seeing,

24
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:33,512
obviously, is believing.
I try to make you see through

25
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:37,268
the dumb equations and
admittedly my methods are

26
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:42,063
sometimes somewhat different
from what you're used to here at

27
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:44,54
MIT.
I try to inspire you and at

28
00:01:44,54 --> 00:01:47,737
times I try to make you wonder
and think.

29
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:52,052
And I want to keep it that way.
I believe that hardcore

30
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:56,208
probling- problem-solving is
really the domain of the

31
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,564
recitations.
Many of you found the exam too

32
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:03,984
easy,
and many of you found the exam

33
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:07,638
too hard.
Some complained it was too hard

34
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:12,116
because it was too easy.
[audience laughter] Quite

35
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:16,136
ironic, isn't it?
They say we want more math,

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:21,344
we want more standard problems.
Look, who wants more math?

37
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:24,999
I'm teaching physics.
I test you physics,

38
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,831
I don't test you math
abilities.

39
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:33,554
If you digest the homework,
and that's very important that

40
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,321
you make the homework part of
your culture,

41
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:40,077
that you study the solutions.
The solutions that we put on

42
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,922
the web, today,
four fifteen,

43
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:45,085
solutions through number four
will go on the Web.

44
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:48,115
Believe me, they are truly
excellent solutions,

45
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:50,619
not cut and dry.
They give you a lot of

46
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:53,321
background.
If you digest those solutions,

47
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:57,274
then the concepts will sink in.
And now, at your fifty minute

48
00:02:57,274 --> 00:03:01,03
test, do you really want
problems which

49
00:03:01,03 --> 00:03:04,226
are complicated maths?
Clearly, not.

50
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,331
I could try that,
during next exam,

51
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:12,628
but then I may have to buy
myself a bullet-proof vest to be

52
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:15,367
safe.
Concepts is what matters.

53
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:20,664
When I gave my exam review
here, I highlighted the concept.

54
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:25,322
Each little problem I did here
was extremely simple.

55
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:28,701
Conceptually,
they were not so simple.

56
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:33,444
But from a math point of view,
trivial.

57
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:38,192
Clearly, I can not cover all
the subjects in a fifteen minute

58
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,487
exam.
I have to make a choice,

59
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,653
so your preferred topic may not
be there.

60
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:48,243
Some of you think that the pace
of this course is too slow.

61
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:50,696
Some of you think it's too
fast.

62
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:54,732
The score, the average score,
was three point eight.

63
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:57,66
Four point zero would have been
ideal.

64
00:03:57,66 --> 00:04:03,516
What do you want me to do?
I can't accommodate all of you.

65
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:08,629
Those who think it's too slow,
and those who think it's too

66
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,361
fast.
Three point eight is close

67
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:14,798
enough to ideal for me,
four point zero.

68
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:18,5
And so I'll have to leave it
the way it is.

69
00:04:18,5 --> 00:04:22,026
Besides that,
keep in mind you are now at

70
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,494
MIT.
You're no longer in high

71
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:26,697
school.
Now the good news.

72
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:31,897
There were quite a few students
who said the homework is too

73
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,07
long.
Not a single person said it was

74
00:04:35,07 --> 00:04:39,036
too short.
I can fix that.

75
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:43,668
I will reduce all future
assignments by about twenty-five

76
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:47,969
percent, effective tomorrow.
I have already taken off

77
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:50,946
assignment number five,
two problems.

78
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:54,586
You're down now to seven,
and I will do that,

79
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,398
all assignments that are coming
up.

80
00:04:57,398 --> 00:05:00,871
My pleasure.
Today, I'm going to cover with

81
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:05,999
you something that conceptually
is the most difficult of all of

82
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:10,218
eight oh two.
And you will need time

83
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:13,813
to digest it.
And if you think that what

84
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:18,516
you're going to see is crazy,
then you're not alone.

85
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:22,112
The only good news is that
conceptually,

86
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:25,708
it's not going to become more
difficult.

87
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:31,332
Remember that Oersted in 1819
discovered that a steady current

88
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:36,034
produces a steady magnetic
field, and that connected

89
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:41,197
electricity with magnetism.
A little later,

90
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:46,353
Faraday therefore suggested
that maybe a steady magnetic

91
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:52,164
field produces a steady current.
And he did many experiments to

92
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:55,257
show that.
Turned to not to be so.

93
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:58,912
And one way he tried that is as
follows.

94
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:02,099
He had here battery,
with a switch,

95
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,598
and here he had a solenoid.
He closes the switch.

96
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,003
A current will flow,
and that creates a magnetic

97
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,638
field
in the solenoid,

98
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:19,699
and that magnetic field,
maybe it runs like so,

99
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:23,99
depends on the direction of the
current.

100
00:06:23,99 --> 00:06:29,162
And so now, he put around this
solenoid a loop .

101
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:34,993
Let's call this loop number
two, and it was around the

102
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:39,945
solenoid, and let's call this
loop number one,

103
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:48,611
of which the solenoid is part.
Whenever there was a current in

104
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:53,169
number one, he never managed to
see a current in number two.

105
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:57,882
If there is a current going in
number one, there is a magnetic

106
00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:01,59
field and that magnetic field is
seen, of course,

107
00:07:01,59 --> 00:07:04,68
by the conductor number two by
that loop.

108
00:07:04,68 --> 00:07:08,31
Never any current.
So he concluded that a steady

109
00:07:08,31 --> 00:07:11,632
magnetic field as produced by
the solenoids,

110
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,491
circuit one,
does not produce a steady

111
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:18,353
current in number two.
But then, one day he noticed

112
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:22,659
that as
he closed the switch he saw a

113
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:26,834
current in number two,
and when he opened the switch

114
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:31,5
again he saw a current in number
two, and therefore he now

115
00:07:31,5 --> 00:07:35,757
concluded that a changing
magnetic field is causing a

116
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:38,705
current.
Not a steady magnetic field,

117
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:43,044
but a changing magnetic field.
And this was a profound

118
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:47,874
discovery which changed our
world and it contributed largely

119
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:54,259
to the technological revolution
of the late nineteenth and early

120
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,44
twenty century.
The current,

121
00:07:57,44 --> 00:08:04,154
therefore an electric field,
can be produced by a changing

122
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:09,337
magnetic field,
and that phenomenon is called

123
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:15,697
electromagnetic induction,
and that phenomenon runs our

124
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:21,469
economy, as you will see in the
next few lectures.

125
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:27,476
I have here a conducting wire,
a square.

126
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:30,295
I could've chosen any other
shape.

127
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:33,625
Try to make you see three
dimensionally.

128
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:38,152
And I approach this conducting
wire with a bar magnet.

129
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:42,507
The bar magnet has a magnetic
field running like so.

130
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:46,35
As I approach that loop,
that conducting wire,

131
00:08:46,35 --> 00:08:49,681
moving the bar magnet,
that's essential.

132
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:53,097
I can't hold it still.
I have to move it.

133
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:56,854
If I come down from above and I
move it down,

134
00:08:56,854 --> 00:09:02,121
you're going to see a
current going through this

135
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:04,764
loop.
And that current will go into

136
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:09,274
such a direction that it opposes
the change of the magnetic

137
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:11,995
field.
The magnetic field is in down

138
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:16,504
direction and it is increasing
as I move the bar magnet in.

139
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:20,936
Then this current loop will
produce a magnetic field which

140
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,745
is in this direction,
and when you look from below

141
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:28,944
the current will go clockwise,
producing a current -- a

142
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,754
magnetic field in this
direction.

143
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:37,975
If you move the bar magnetic
out, then the magnetic field is

144
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:42,046
going down here,
then the current will reverse.

145
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:47,355
The current wants to oppose the
change in the magnetic field,

146
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:52,311
and that's called Lenz's Law.
It is the most human law in

147
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:56,293
physics, because there's inertia
in all of us.

148
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:59,214
We all fight change at some
level.

149
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:03,461
Lenz's Law is extremely
powerful in

150
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:08,746
always determining in which
direction these induced currents

151
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:12,149
will run.
It is not a quantitative law.

152
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:16,807
You can not calculate how
strong the current will be,

153
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:21,554
but it's very useful as you
will see today to know the

154
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:26,749
direction of that current that
gets you out of all kinds of

155
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:30,689
problems with minus signs.
I now want to do a

156
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:36,87
demonstration which is very much
like what you see here.

157
00:10:36,87 --> 00:10:43,286
I have here a loop.
That is the square that you see

158
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:50,73
there except that it's not- not
one loop, but it is many of

159
00:10:50,73 --> 00:10:54,58
them.
Hundreds, doesn't matter.

160
00:10:54,58 --> 00:11:01,639
And what we're going to show
you is an amp meter that is

161
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,927
connected, so there is somewhere
in this

162
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:11,798
circuit an amp meter.
I have a bar magnet and I'm

163
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:15,668
going to approach this
conducting loop with a bar

164
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:20,828
magnet and you're going to see a
current running in one direction

165
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:25,343
and when I pull it out it will
be running in the opposite

166
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:30,181
direction, and when I hold my
hand still so that the magnetic

167
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:32,842
field is not changing,
no current.

168
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:38,163
You're going to see the current
meter there, and here

169
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:41,96
is the bar magnet.
I come close to this conducting

170
00:11:41,96 --> 00:11:44,206
loop.
Notice we see a current.

171
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:47,228
I pull back,
the current is in the other

172
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,629
direction.
Now I will go faster,

173
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:53,968
so that the change of the
magnetic field per unit time is

174
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:56,447
stronger.
[whistle] More current.

175
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:59,313
I go out fast.
[whistle] More current.

176
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:03,961
So we see it's the change of
the magnetic field that matters.

177
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:07,06
If I come in very slowly,
which I do now,

178
00:12:07,06 --> 00:12:11,244
very slowly,
we almost see nothing.

179
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:17,248
Right now the entire magnetic
field is inside this loop.

180
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:23,472
The strongest I can have it.
Nothing happens because there

181
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:27,184
is no change in the magnetic
field.

182
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:32,534
It's only when I do this that
you see the current.

183
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:38,539
So an induced current is
clearly the result of a driving

184
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:42,033
force.
There must be,

185
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:46,712
just like we had with batteries
in the past, there must be an

186
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,441
EMF.
There must be an electric field

187
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:52,56
that is produced in this
conducting loop.

188
00:12:52,56 --> 00:12:57,084
And so I create now an induced
EMF -- we used that word EMF

189
00:12:57,084 --> 00:13:01,139
earlier for batteries,
so now we have an induced EMF,

190
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,116
which is the result of this
changing magnetic field,

191
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:09,015
and that therefore is the
induced current times the

192
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:13,538
resistance of that entire closed
conductor,

193
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:16,598
whatever is in there.
In this case,

194
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:20,377
the total resistance of all
these windings,

195
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:23,976
of all the copper wire.
That's Ohm's Law.

196
00:13:23,976 --> 00:13:29,105
So the induced EMF is always
the induced current times the

197
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,894
resistance.
Faraday did a lot of

198
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:37,203
experiments, and one of the
experiments that he did was that

199
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:43,501
he produced a magnetic field,
so he ran a current through

200
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:48,258
a loop of some kind,
let's say he ran a current

201
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:52,6
going around,
creating therefore a magnetic

202
00:13:52,6 --> 00:13:58,804
field, and he was switching the
current in and out so that he

203
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:04,387
could change the current,
and so it produces a magnetic

204
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:10,901
and this magnetic field changes
when you close and open the- the

205
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:13,072
switch.
And then here,

206
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:18,759
he had his second conducting
wire,

207
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,398
just like we had there,
and he measured in there the

208
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:25,763
current.
And what he found,

209
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:29,22
experimentally,
is that the EMF that is

210
00:14:29,22 --> 00:14:33,677
generated in here,
which I will call EMF generated

211
00:14:33,677 --> 00:14:38,68
in my conducting loop number
two, is proportional to the

212
00:14:38,68 --> 00:14:42,683
magnetic field change produced
by number one,

213
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:47,504
so the field goes through
number two and this field is

214
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:52,864
changing,
so he knows that if the change

215
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:57,947
is faster, as you just saw,
you get a higher EMF.

216
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:03,771
He also noticed that E two is
proportional to this area,

217
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:10,124
so to the area of number two.
And that gave him the idea that

218
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:16,689
the EMF really is the result of
the change of the magnetic flux

219
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:21,455
through this surface of number
two.

220
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:27,347
And I want to refresh your
memory on the idea of magnetic

221
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:31,134
flux.
We do know, or we remember what

222
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:34,817
electric flux is.
And magnetic flux,

223
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:38,394
very similar.
If this is a surface,

224
00:15:38,394 --> 00:15:43,76
and the local vector
perpendicular to the surface is

225
00:15:43,76 --> 00:15:49,547
like so, of course it could be
in a different direction,

226
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:54,597
and the local magnetic field is
for

227
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:59,461
instance like so,
then a magnetic flux through

228
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:04,216
this surface is defined.
We call it phi of B,

229
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:08,106
is the integral over an open
surface.

230
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:11,889
This is an open surface of B
dot DA.

231
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:18,157
And the electric fields we
defined in exactly the same way,

232
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:24,424
electric flux,
except we had an E here.

233
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:32,034
There was nothing there.
So if this magnetic flux is

234
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:40,986
changing, Faraday concluded that
then you have an EMF in this

235
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:47,7
conducting wire.
So essential is the change of

236
00:16:47,7 --> 00:16:54,116
the magnetic flux.
If we take some kind of a

237
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:59,188
conducting wire,
like so,

238
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:04,083
let's make it in the blackboard
for now to make it easy.

239
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:09,244
And I attach to this wire a
surface because the moment that

240
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:14,227
you talk about flux you must
always specify your surface.

241
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:19,388
A flux can only go through a
surface, so this is my surface

242
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:23,659
now for simplicity.
And there is a magnetic field

243
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:29,443
coming out of the blackboard at
me, and it is growing.

244
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:33,905
It is increasing.
I will now get an EMF,

245
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:37,909
a current flowing in this
direction.

246
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:41,912
Lenz's law.
If the magnetic field is

247
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:48,776
increasing, then the current
will be in such a direction that

248
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:54,61
it opposes the change.
It doesn't want that magnetic

249
00:17:54,61 --> 00:17:59,643
field to increase,
and so it goes around like

250
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:03,161
this,
the current,

251
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:10,818
sort of, it produces a magnetic
field that is in the blackboard.

252
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:18,476
And so it is the flux change of
that magnetic field through this

253
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:22,852
flat surface that determines the
EMF.

254
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:28,2
So the EMF is then the flux
change, d phi dt,

255
00:18:28,2 --> 00:18:34,131
through that surface.
To express Lenz's Law that it

256
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:37,861
is always opposing the change of
the magnetic flux,

257
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:41,739
we have a minus sign here.
But minus signs will never

258
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:45,618
bother you, believe me,
because you'll always know in

259
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:49,572
which direction the EMF is.
It's clear that the EMF is

260
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:53,973
going to be in this direction.
That's the direction in which

261
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:58,449
it will make the current flow.
But we have to put it there to

262
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:04,304
be mathematically correct.
That's really Lenz's Law.

263
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:08,093
You're looking at Lenz's Law
here.

264
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:15,098
So you can also write down for
this minus the surface integral

265
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:21,53
of B dot DA over that open --
whoo, I hope you didn't see

266
00:19:21,53 --> 00:19:24,745
this.
Over this open surface.

267
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:30,257
That's the [break in tape]
Oops, look what I did.

268
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:36,577
I forgot the DDT in front
of the integral sign.

269
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:42,196
If you put yourself inside that
conductor, and you marched

270
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:48,309
around in the direction of the
current, you will see everywhere

271
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:52,252
in the wire an electric field,
of course.

272
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:56,59
Otherwise, there would be no
current flowing.

273
00:19:56,59 --> 00:20:01,223
And so if you go once around
this whole circuit,

274
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:05,955
then that EMF must of course
also be

275
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:11,32
E dot DL over the closed loop.
So you're marching inside the

276
00:20:11,32 --> 00:20:16,684
wire, you find everywhere an
electric field and these little

277
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:20,684
sections IDL.
E and DL are always in the same

278
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:26,048
direction if you stay in the
wire, and so this should be the

279
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:31,685
same and this is a closed loop.
So this is all if you want what

280
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:36,049
we call Faraday's Law.
We never see it in so much

281
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:40,35
detail.
I will abbreviate it a little

282
00:20:40,35 --> 00:20:44,716
bit on the board there.
But I want you to appreciate

283
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:48,141
that there is no battery in this
circuit.

284
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:53,277
There is only a change in the
magnetic flux through a surface

285
00:20:53,277 --> 00:20:57,386
that I have attached through the
conducting wire,

286
00:20:57,386 --> 00:21:02,609
and then I get an induced EMF
and the induced EMF will produce

287
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:07,66
a current given by Ohm's Law.
So I want to write down now on

288
00:21:07,66 --> 00:21:13,816
that blackboard there,
Faraday's law in a somewhat

289
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:20,99
abbreviated way because we have
all Maxwell's equations here and

290
00:21:20,99 --> 00:21:26
so we now have that the closed
loop integral,

291
00:21:26 --> 00:21:31,694
closed loop of E dot DL --
that's that induced EMF.

292
00:21:31,694 --> 00:21:38,071
You can take minus d phi dt or
the time derivative of the

293
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:44,513
integral B dot DA.
That's the one I will take.

294
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:50,9
Integral of B dot DA and this
is over an open surface.

295
00:21:50,9 --> 00:21:57,287
And that open surface has to be
attached to this loop,

296
00:21:57,287 --> 00:22:02,107
and that is Faraday.
We have Gauss's Law,

297
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:08,012
we have Ampere's Law.
We have this one which tells

298
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:13,622
you that magnetic monopoles
don't exist.

299
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:19,474
This would only not be zero if
you had a magnetic monopole and

300
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:24,656
put it in a closed surface.
Come and see me if you find

301
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:27,918
one.
And this now is Faraday's Law,

302
00:22:27,918 --> 00:22:33,003
so you think that all four
Maxwell's equations are now

303
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,826
complete.
Not quite.

304
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:38,472
We're going to change this one
shortly.

305
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:42,501
So we can't celebrate yet.
We have to wait.

306
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:48,66
It's a big party.
There's always a little bit of

307
00:22:48,66 --> 00:22:54,943
an issue about the direction of
DA and I will explain to you how

308
00:22:54,943 --> 00:23:00,728
the convention goes but it
really is not so crucial because

309
00:23:00,728 --> 00:23:06,713
Lenz's Law always helps you to
find the direction of the EMF,

310
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:12,498
but if we are trying to be
purist, if this is my conducting

311
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:16,786
loop and if I attach a flat
surface to this,

312
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:22,462
if I did that,
and if I go around closed loop

313
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:26,042
integral E dot DL,
Faraday doesn't tell me which

314
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,784
way I have to go.
I can go clockwise.

315
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:33,049
I can go counterclockwise.
We will then do the same thing

316
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,391
that we did before with Ampere's
Law, apply the right-hand

317
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:40,742
corkscrew rule,
and that is that if you march

318
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:43,713
around clockwise,
then DA will be in the

319
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:48,206
blackboard perpendicular to the
blackboard, perpendicular to

320
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:51,482
this surface,
and if you go counterclockwise

321
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:57,624
then DA will come towards you.
The surface doesn't have to be

322
00:23:57,624 --> 00:23:59,282
flat.
It can be flat.

323
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:04,007
There's nothing wrong with it.
But there can also be a bag

324
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:07,157
attached to it,
as we also had earlier.

325
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:11,55
I have here the closed
conducting wire and I could put

326
00:24:11,55 --> 00:24:16,275
a surface right here but I can
also make it a [inaudible],

327
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:20,419
like this, perfectly fine.
Nothing wrong with that.

328
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,984
That's a open surface attached
to this loop.

329
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:27,908
That's fine.
You have a choice,

330
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:32,451
and the convention with DA is
then exactly the same,

331
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:37,082
that if you go clockwise then
the DA would be in this

332
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:41,803
direction using the right-hand
corkscrew locally here.

333
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:46,435
If you went counterclockwise,
the DA would flip over.

334
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:50,8
So what is now the recipe that
you have to follow?

335
00:24:50,8 --> 00:24:54,363
You have a circuit,
electric circuit that

336
00:24:54,363 --> 00:24:57,733
determines
then your loops,

337
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:00,814
of course.
You can take loops anywhere in

338
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:04,896
space, but that's not too
meaningful, so you take them

339
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:08,439
into your  circuits,
and so you define the loop

340
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:11,135
first.
Then you define the direction

341
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,678
in which you want to march
around that circuit.

342
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:18,221
You attach an open surface to
that closed loop,

343
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:22,92
and you can determine on that
entire surface the integral of B

344
00:25:22,92 --> 00:25:25,462
dot DA.
Everywhere on that surface

345
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:29,095
locally
you know the DA,

346
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:32,966
locally you know the B,
you do the integration and you

347
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:36,764
get your magnetic flux,
and then if you know the time

348
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:40,489
change of that magnetic flux,
then you know the EMF.

349
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:43,63
If you go around in this
conducting circuit,

350
00:25:43,63 --> 00:25:46,989
and you measure everywhere the
electric fields,

351
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:51,372
then the integral of E dot DL,
if you go around the loop will

352
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:55,096
give you the same answer,
and that connects the two.

353
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:59,406
The magnetic flux change is
connected with the integral of E

354
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:02,904
dot
DL when you go around.

355
00:26:02,904 --> 00:26:07,28
And you have to take that minus
sign into account.

356
00:26:07,28 --> 00:26:11,835
How come it doesn't matter
whether you choose a flat

357
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:14,961
surface or whether you choose a
bag?

358
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:19,962
Well, think of magnetic field
lines as a flow of water or

359
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:23,981
spaghetti, if you like that,
or a flow of air.

360
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:28,804
It is clear that if there is
some kind of a flow of air

361
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:33,29
through this
opening, that it's got to come

362
00:26:33,29 --> 00:26:36,464
out somewhere,
so it always comes out of this

363
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,051
surface.
And therefore,

364
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:41,009
you're really free to choose
that surface,

365
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:45,121
so you always pick a surface
that is the best one for you.

366
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:47,719
Now, all this looks very
complicated.

367
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:50,027
But in practice,
it really isn't,

368
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:54,428
because your loop is always a
conducting wire in your circuit,

369
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:58,684
and the minus sign is never an
issue because you always know

370
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:03,23
with Lenz's law in which
direction the EMF is.

371
00:27:03,23 --> 00:27:07,414
In fact, when I solved these
problems, I don't even look at

372
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:10,155
the minus sign.
I ignore it completely.

373
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:14,556
I def- I calculate the magnetic
flux change, and then I always

374
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:18,813
know in which direction the
current is, so I don't even look

375
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:21,843
at the minus sign.
Now I want to show you a

376
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:26,316
demonstration which is very much
like what Faraday tried to do.

377
00:27:26,316 --> 00:27:29,923
I have here a solenoid.
We've seen this one before.

378
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:35,052
We can generate quite a strong
magnetic field with that.

379
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:38,819
And we're going to put around
this solenoid one loop,

380
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:41,282
like we had here,
like Faraday did,

381
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:45,556
and then we're going to close
the switch, and so we're going

382
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:49,685
to build up this magnetic field
and we're going to see the

383
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:53,452
current in that loop.
And so if we look- if we make a

384
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:57,508
cross-section straight through
here, then it will look as

385
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:59,609
follows.
Then you see here the

386
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:03,81
solenoids, so the magnetic field
is really

387
00:28:03,81 --> 00:28:07,898
confined to the solenoid.
Magnetic field outside the

388
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:11,664
solenoid as we discussed earlier
is almost zero,

389
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:15,11
so there's only a magnetic
field right here.

390
00:28:15,11 --> 00:28:17,755
Keep that in mind in what
follows.

391
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:21,201
And now we're going to put a
wire around it,

392
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:25,849
with an amp meter in there.
If the magnetic field comes out

393
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:28,093
of the board,
and is growing,

394
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:33,462
increasing, the current will
flow in this direction.

395
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,841
Lenz's Law.
If it is decreasing,

396
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:39,294
the current will go in the
opposite direction.

397
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:43,131
Now keep in mind that the
magnetic flux though this

398
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:46,584
surface, that is,
my surface which I attach to

399
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:50,268
this closed loop,
that that magnetic flux remains

400
00:28:50,268 --> 00:28:55,025
the same whether I make the loop
this big or whether I make the

401
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:59,169
loop very crooked like so,
because the magnetic flux is

402
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:03,467
only confined to the inner
portion of the

403
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:07,036
solenoid and that's not
changing.

404
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:12,502
And so when I change the shape
of this outer loop,

405
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:17,188
you will not see any change in
the current.

406
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,646
I hope that doesn't confuse
you.

407
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:26,224
I'm going to purposely change
the size of the loop,

408
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:29,682
and so I'm going to do that
now.

409
00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:35,929
You're going to see there a
very sensitive amp meter  and

410
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:42,288
you're going to see here this
loop,

411
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:45,815
the big wire,
and I'm going to just put it

412
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:50,03
over this solenoid.
Let me first make sure that my

413
00:29:50,03 --> 00:29:54,59
amp meter which is extremely
sensitive, I can zero it.

414
00:29:54,59 --> 00:29:58,548
It's sign sensitive.
If the current goes in one

415
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:03,194
direction, you will see the
needle go in one direction.

416
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:06,807
If the current goes in the
other direction,

417
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:11,109
you will see the change.
And so now I put this loop

418
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,034
around here, crazy shape this
loop.

419
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:18,422
So it's around this solenoid
once,

420
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:22,24
so the magnetic field is inside
the solenoids,

421
00:30:22,24 --> 00:30:27,502
and so think of a surface which
is attached to this crazy loop,

422
00:30:27,502 --> 00:30:32,509
and now I'm going to turn the
current on, and only while the

423
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:37,431
current is changing will there
be a changing magnetic flux.

424
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:41,845
Only during that portion will
you see a current flow.

425
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:43,627
Three, two, one,
zero.

426
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:47,106
I will break the current,
three, two, one,

427
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:49,652
zero.
Went the other direction.

428
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:53,895
If I change the size of the
loop,

429
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:57,13
I'm making it now different,
much smaller.

430
00:30:57,13 --> 00:31:01,153
Makes no difference,
for reasons that I explained to

431
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:05,886
you, because the magnetic flux
is not determined in this case

432
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:10,382
by the size of my loop but is
determined by the solenoids,

433
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:14,642
so if I do it again now,
with a very different shape of

434
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:17,324
the loop -- let me zero this
again.

435
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:18,981
Three, two, one,
zero.

436
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:20,637
Three, two, one,
zero.

437
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:24,029
No change.
Almost the same

438
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:29,143
which you saw before.
Now comes something that may

439
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:35,196
not be so intuitive to you.
I'm now going to wrap this wire

440
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:39,58
three times around.
And so this outer loop,

441
00:31:39,58 --> 00:31:44,172
this outer conducting wire,
is now like this.

442
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:47,929
One, two, three.
Something like that.

443
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:55,548
Now I have to attach in my head
a surface to this closed loop.

444
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:59,702
My god, what does it look like?
What a ridiculous surface.

445
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:03,201
Well, that's your problem,
not Faraday's problem.

446
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:07,502
How can you imagine that there
is a surface attached to this

447
00:32:07,502 --> 00:32:10,053
loop?
Well, take the whole thing and

448
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,188
dip it in soap.
Take it out and see what you

449
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:15,739
see.
The soap will attach everywhere

450
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:19,311
on the conducting loop.
And if this loop were like

451
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:23,684
this, going up like a spiral
staircase, you're going to get a

452
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:27,839
surface that goes up like this.
But the magnetic fields go

453
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,253
through
all three of them.

454
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:35,473
Therefore, the changing
magnetic flux will go three

455
00:32:35,473 --> 00:32:39,692
times through the surface now,
and so Faraday says,

456
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:44,502
fah- that you're going to see
three times the EMF that you

457
00:32:44,502 --> 00:32:47,624
would see if there were only one
loop.

458
00:32:47,624 --> 00:32:52,519
And if you go thousand times
around, you get thousand times

459
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,641
the EMF of one loop.
Not so intuitive.

460
00:32:55,641 --> 00:33:00,366
So I'm around now once.
I go around twice.

461
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:05,009
And I go around a third time.
I have three loops around it

462
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:06,638
now.
I can zero that,

463
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:10,222
but that's not so important.
Three, two, one,

464
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,398
zero, and you saw a much larger
current.

465
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:18,204
It's about three times larger
because the EMF is three times

466
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,403
larger.
I break the current.

467
00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:24,964
We see it three times larger.
And this is the idea behind

468
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:28,222
transformers.
You can get any EMF in that

469
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:32,212
wire that you want to,
by having

470
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:36,617
many, many loops.
You can get it up to thousands

471
00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:40,084
of volts, and that's not so
intuitive.

472
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,644
So Faraday's law is very
non-intuitive.

473
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:46,83
Kirchoff's Rule was very
intuitive.

474
00:33:46,83 --> 00:33:52,172
Kirchoff said when you go
around a circuit the closed-loop

475
00:33:52,172 --> 00:33:55,451
integral of E dot DL is always
zero.

476
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:59,668
Not true is you have a changing
magnetic flux.

477
00:33:59,668 --> 00:34:04,54
If you have a changing magnetic
flux,

478
00:34:04,54 --> 00:34:08,698
the electric fields inside the
conducting wires now become

479
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:12,053
non-conservative.
Kirchoff's Rule only holds as

480
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:15,262
long as the electric fields are
conservative.

481
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:18,981
If an electric field is
conservative and you go from

482
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:22,409
point one to point two,
the integral E dot DL is

483
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,42
independent of the path.
That's the potential difference

484
00:34:26,42 --> 00:34:29,556
between two points,
that's uniquely defined.

485
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:33,713
That's no longer the case.
If you go around once with this

486
00:34:33,713 --> 00:34:37,675
experiment,
you get a certain EMF,

487
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:42,212
you go three times around,
you get a different value.

488
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:47,185
Your path is now different,
and that's very non-intuitive,

489
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,897
because you're dealing with
non-conservative fields for

490
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:54,776
which we have very little
feeling.

491
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:57,568
Now, I'm going to blow your
mind.

492
00:34:57,568 --> 00:35:01,843
I'm going to make you see
something that you won't

493
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:06,73
believe, and so try to follow
step-by-step

494
00:35:06,73 --> 00:35:15,313
leading up to this unbelievable
and very non-intuitive result.

495
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:22,489
I have here a battery,
and the battery has an EMF of

496
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:26,428
one volt.
Here is a resistor,

497
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:33,745
R one, which is hundred ohms.
And here is a resistor,

498
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:39,795
R two, which is nine hundred
ohms.

499
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:44,978
And I'm asking you what is the
current that is flowing around.

500
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:49,565
And you will laugh at me.
You will say that's almost an

501
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,284
insult.
I wish you had given that

502
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:56,871
problem at the first exam,
because E equals the current

503
00:35:56,871 --> 00:36:01,034
that is going to run,
divided by R one plus R two.

504
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,583
Oh, my goodness,
what did I do.

505
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:06,216
I forgot Ohm's Law.
E equals IR,

506
00:36:06,216 --> 00:36:11,739
remember, not I over R.
So R one plus R two should

507
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:16,493
go upstairs.
And everything that follows is

508
00:36:16,493 --> 00:36:21,7
correct, so you don't have to
worry about that.

509
00:36:21,7 --> 00:36:25,661
This was just a big slip of the
pen.

510
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:31,774
And so the current I is ten to
the minus three amperes.

511
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:34,604
One milliampere.
Big deal.

512
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:38,452
Easy.
Current is going to flow like

513
00:36:38,452 --> 00:36:39,584
this.
Fine.

514
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:46,603
Let's call this point D,
and call this point A.

515
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:51,696
And I asked you what is the
potential difference between D

516
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:54,823
and A.
You will be equally insulted.

517
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:57,682
VD minus VA,
you apply Ohm's Law,

518
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,167
you say that's this current
times R two.

519
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:03,401
Absolutely.
I times R two.

520
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:06,618
But that is plus oh point nine
volts.

521
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:10,907
Now I say to you,
well, suppose you had gone this

522
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:15,911
way, then you would've said,
well, I find the same thing,

523
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:19,842
of course.
Kirchoff's Rule.

524
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:24,371
So indeed, if you go VD minus
VA, and you go this way,

525
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:28,9
then notice this battery,
this point is one volt above

526
00:37:28,9 --> 00:37:32,232
this point.
But you have in the resistor

527
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:36,675
here, you have a voltage drop
according to Ohm's Law,

528
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:41,375
and the current times hundred
ohms gives you a one-tenth

529
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:45,476
voltage drop here,
so VD minus VA is the one volt

530
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:51,458
from the battery minus I times R
one, and that is plus oh

531
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:55,061
point nine volts.
What a waste of time that we

532
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:58,345
did it twice and we found the
same result.

533
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:03,07
So I connect here a voltmeter.
The voltmeter is connected to

534
00:38:03,07 --> 00:38:07,154
point D and to point A.
And I asked you what are you

535
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:10,358
going to see.
The answer is plus oh point

536
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:14,682
nine volts, and you will
provided that the plus side of

537
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:19,167
the voltmeter is connected here
and the minus side of the

538
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:36,754
voltmeter there.
Voltmeters are polarity

539
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:53,172
sensitive.
This is fine.

540
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:57,994
a solenoid which you see right
here, and this solenoid when I

541
00:38:57,994 --> 00:39:02,254
switch it on is creating an
increasing magnetic field.

542
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:06,594
Only here, and let's assume
that an increasing magnetic

543
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,372
field is coming out of the
board, and that it is

544
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:13,426
increasing.
Lenz's Law will immediately

545
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:16,722
tell you in what direction the
current is.

546
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:20,58
If this magnetic field is
increasing towards you,

547
00:39:20,58 --> 00:39:24,971
the current will be in this
direction.

548
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:30,051
The magnetic flux change,
d phi dt, at a particular

549
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:33,911
moment in time,
happens to be one volt.

550
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:37,162
An amazing coincidence,
isn't it.

551
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:41,327
E induced at a moment in time
is one volt.

552
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:44,883
Now, I ask you,
what is the current?

553
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:50,978
Well, you'll be surprised that
I even have the courage to ask

554
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:55,855
you that, because Ohm's Law
holds.

555
00:39:55,855 --> 00:40:00,555
The induced EMF is one volt and
R one plus R two is still a

556
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:03,715
thousand ohms,
so ten to the minus three

557
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,551
amperes.
I really make a nuisance of

558
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:11,413
myself when I say what is VD
minus VA, and you get annoyed at

559
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:14,979
me and you say,
look, the current I through R

560
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,167
two, Ohm's Law,
V equals IR,

561
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:20,408
plus oh point nine volts.
And then I say,

562
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:25,514
but now suppose we go the
other- the other side,

563
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:32,66
and we want to know now what VD
minus VA is, and now it's not so

564
00:40:32,66 --> 00:40:36,517
simple, because there's no
battery.

565
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:42,756
And so now when I go from D to
A, I don't have this one,

566
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:48,314
and therefore I now find minus
oh point one volts.

567
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:52,057
I find a totally different
answer.

568
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:59,213
I attach a voltmeter here.
That voltmeter will show me

569
00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:05,24
plus oh point nine volts.
Now I attach a voltmeter here,

570
00:41:05,24 --> 00:41:08,309
the same one.
I flip it over.

571
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:12,911
It's connected between point D
and point A.

572
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:16,966
It will read minus oh point one
volts.

573
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:21,678
This voltmeter,
which is connected between D

574
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:28,526
and A, reads plus oh point nine.
This voltmeter which is

575
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:32,491
connected to D and A reads minus
oh point one.

576
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:37,248
The two values are different,
and I placed on the web a

577
00:41:37,248 --> 00:41:41,742
lecture supplement which goes
through the derivation

578
00:41:41,742 --> 00:41:45,354
step-by-step,
which will convince you that

579
00:41:45,354 --> 00:41:48,174
indeed this is what is
happening.

580
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:53,196
Why we can't digest this so
easily is we don't know how to

581
00:41:53,196 --> 00:41:58,57
handle non-conservative fields.
If you have a non-conservative

582
00:41:58,57 --> 00:42:03,357
field,
then if you go from A to D  of

583
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:08,579
E dot DL or from D to A for that
matter, doesn't matter,

584
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:14,276
the answer depends on the path.
It's no longer independent of

585
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:17,029
the path.
And so if here is D,

586
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:20,163
and here is A,
and we go this way,

587
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:25,48
you find oh point nine volts,
plus if you go this way you

588
00:42:25,48 --> 00:42:30,987
find minus oh point one volts.
Faraday has no problems with

589
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:35,758
that.
Kirchoff has a problem with

590
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:38,657
that, but who cares about
Kirchoff?

591
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:43,176
Faraday is the law that
matters, because Faraday's Law

592
00:42:43,176 --> 00:42:46,672
always holds,
because if d phi dt is zero,

593
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:51,021
then you get Kirchoff's.
Kirchoff's rule is simply a

594
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:56,222
special case of Faraday's Law,
and Faraday's Law always holds,

595
00:42:56,222 --> 00:43:00,315
so Kirchoff is for the birds,
and Faraday is not.

596
00:43:00,315 --> 00:43:05,493
Suppose you go from D
to A and back to D.

597
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:12,651
Well, we know that VD minus VA,
if we go through this- if we go

598
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:18,539
this way, through R two,
we know that VD minus VA is

599
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:24,312
plus oh point nine volts.
Now we are at A and we go

600
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:31,123
through the left side back to D.
So we now have VA minus VD.

601
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:36,318
That of course is now plus oh
point

602
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,14
one volts, because remember,
if VD minus VA is minus oh

603
00:43:41,14 --> 00:43:44,265
point one, then VA minus VD is
plus.

604
00:43:44,265 --> 00:43:48,997
And so we add them up,
and we find that VD minus VD is

605
00:43:48,997 --> 00:43:51,586
plus one volts.
Kirchoff said,

606
00:43:51,586 --> 00:43:55,425
has to be zero,
because I'm back at the same

607
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:59,175
potential where I was before.
Faraday says,

608
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:02,3
uh-uh, I'm sorry,
you can't do that.

609
00:44:02,3 --> 00:44:07,746
That one volt is exactly that
EMF of one volt.

610
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:11,678
That is the closed loop
integral of E dot DL around that

611
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:13,465
loop.
It's no longer zero.

612
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:16,538
And therefore,
whenever you define potential

613
00:44:16,538 --> 00:44:20,898
difference, if you do that in
the way of the integral of E dot

614
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:24,472
DL, keep in mind that with
non-conservative fields,

615
00:44:24,472 --> 00:44:28,331
it depends on the path,
and that is very non-intuitive.

616
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:31,476
And I'm going to demonstrate
this now to you.

617
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:35,193
I have a circuit which is
exactly what you have here.

618
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:39,553
I have nine hundred volts in a
conducting copper wire here and

619
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:43,413
I
have a hundred volts here and

620
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:47,687
here is the solenoid.
W We can switch the current on

621
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:52,631
in the solenoid and get a blast
of magnetic field coming up,

622
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:57,24
and the system is going to
react by driving a current in

623
00:44:57,24 --> 00:44:59,921
the direction that you see
there.

624
00:44:59,921 --> 00:45:04,447
And I'd like to be even a
little bit more quantitative,

625
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:08,469
so that you get a little bit
more for your money.

626
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:14,168
The magnetic field takes a
little bit of time to reach

627
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:16,526
the maximum value.
In this course,

628
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:20,67
we will be able to calculate
the time that it takes for the

629
00:45:20,67 --> 00:45:24,457
magnetic field to build up.
We didn't get to that yet,

630
00:45:24,457 --> 00:45:27,458
so forget that part.
It's not so important.

631
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:31,817
I just want you to appreciate
the fact that the magnetic field

632
00:45:31,817 --> 00:45:36,319
as a function of time will come
up like this and will then reach

633
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,748
a maximum.
It's no longer changing.

634
00:45:38,748 --> 00:45:41,249
It's constant.
It's a maximum value.

635
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:44,393
It's very high,
seven, eight hundred Gauss or

636
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:47,012
so for
this unit.

637
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:50,425
We are not interested in a
magnetic field.

638
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:54,837
We are interested in the change
of the magnetic field,

639
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:59,499
so the change of the magnetic
field, dB dT is going to be

640
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:03,411
something like this,
just the derivative of this

641
00:46:03,411 --> 00:46:06,325
curve.
And that is proportional with

642
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:11,32
the induced EMF and that's in
por- pro- proportional with the

643
00:46:11,32 --> 00:46:15,982
current, through Ohm's law.
So if we now plot the voltage

644
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:20,643
as a function of -- let me do
that here,

645
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:26,961
the voltage as a function of
time, then that voltmeter on the

646
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:31,489
right side, I call that V two,
will do this.

647
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:36,016
This is V two,
which is I times R two at the

648
00:46:36,016 --> 00:46:40,755
maximum value.
If those values were correct it

649
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:46,862
would be oh point nine volts,
and V one would go like this.

650
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:50,231
V one equals minus I times R
one.

651
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:55,7
That gives me the minus
oh point one volts.

652
00:46:55,7 --> 00:47:01,087
So the question now is what is
the largest value of dB dT that

653
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:04,443
we can expect.
We also have to know the

654
00:47:04,443 --> 00:47:09,654
surface area of the solenoids so
we can convert it to a flux

655
00:47:09,654 --> 00:47:12,746
change.
Well, the change in magnetic

656
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:18,222
fields is roughly at the fastest
here is about hundred Gauss in

657
00:47:18,222 --> 00:47:20,783
one millisecond.
Very roughly.

658
00:47:20,783 --> 00:47:25,641
So that would mean a field
change, dB dT.

659
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:29,458
That's the maximum value
possible only in the beginning

660
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:33,064
of about ten Tesla per second.
And the surface area,

661
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:37,094
which is that inner circle
there through which the flux is

662
00:47:37,094 --> 00:47:40,982
changing, the fact that my
surface has to be attached to

663
00:47:40,982 --> 00:47:43,952
that loop doesn't change the
magnetic flux.

664
00:47:43,952 --> 00:47:47,275
The magnetic flux is only
determined, of course,

665
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:51,022
by that inner portion,
and so if the inner portion has

666
00:47:51,022 --> 00:47:55,051
an area of say ten square
centimeters, which is ten to the

667
00:47:55,051 --> 00:47:59,505
minus two square meters,
then d phi dt will be

668
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:02,691
approximately ten times ten to
the minus two,

669
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:06,021
so that's about oh point one,
and that's volts.

670
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:08,411
That's EMF.
I don't care about the

671
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:11,017
direction, because I know Lenz's
Law.

672
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:14,709
So you're going to see an
experiment which is almost

673
00:48:14,709 --> 00:48:19,198
identical to what I have there,
except all values are down by a

674
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:21,298
factor of ten.
But that's all.

675
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:24,773
And you're going to see that
demonstration there.

676
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:27,741
And a few years ago,
when I first did this

677
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:31,795
experiment in twenty-six one
hundred,

678
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:36,075
there were several of my
colleagues, professors of both

679
00:48:36,075 --> 00:48:40,434
the physics department and EE
department in my audience.

680
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:43,446
And some did not believe what
they saw.

681
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:48,122
In fact, it was so bad that
after my lecture they came to me

682
00:48:48,122 --> 00:48:52,797
and some accused me for having
cheated on the demonstration.

683
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:55,571
This tells you something about
them.

684
00:48:55,571 --> 00:49:00,168
Imagine, professors in physics
and professors in electrical

685
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:04,219
engineering
department who did not believe

686
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:06,872
what they were seeing.
That tells you how

687
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:10,388
non-intuitive this is.
The simple fact that we had one

688
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:14,236
voltmeter connected to point D
and A, and another voltmeter

689
00:49:14,236 --> 00:49:18,018
connected to the same point,
they were unwilling to accept

690
00:49:18,018 --> 00:49:21,6
that the two voltmeters read a
totally different value.

691
00:49:21,6 --> 00:49:24,585
They were not used to
non-conservative fields.

692
00:49:24,585 --> 00:49:26,642
Their brains couldn't handle
it.

693
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:30,224
But that's the way it is,
and I'm going to show this to

694
00:49:30,224 --> 00:49:33,94
you now.
You're going to see it there,

695
00:49:33,94 --> 00:49:36,467
and when you see this
demonstration,

696
00:49:36,467 --> 00:49:40,726
it will be probably the only
time in your life that you will

697
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:43,614
ever see this,
and I want you to remember

698
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:46,069
this.
You're going to see something

699
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:49,463
that is very strange,
and I want you to tell you

700
00:49:49,463 --> 00:49:53,289
grandchildren about it,
that you have actually seen it

701
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:56,755
with your own eyes.
You're going to see there  on

702
00:49:56,755 --> 00:49:59,643
the left side,
you're going to see V one,

703
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:04,842
and on the right side you're
going to see V two.

704
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:09,606
The vertical scale is such that
very roughly from here to here

705
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:13,825
is about oh point one volts.
And the horizontal unit is

706
00:50:13,825 --> 00:50:17,808
about five milliseconds,
and the whole voltage pulse

707
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:22,261
lasts about ten milliseconds,
because from here to here is

708
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:26,323
about ten milliseconds.
And the value that you expect

709
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:30,463
for V two will be nine times
higher than V one and the

710
00:50:30,463 --> 00:50:34,837
polarities will be reversed.
If you're ready for this big

711
00:50:34,837 --> 00:50:37,492
moment
in your life,

712
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,13
three, two, one,
zero.

713
00:50:39,13 --> 00:50:41,548
Look on the left.
There's V one.

714
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:44,668
Notice, it's negative.
Look on the right.

715
00:50:44,668 --> 00:50:47,944
There's V two.
It's about nine times larger

716
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:51,22
than V one.
Don't pay any attention to this

717
00:50:51,22 --> 00:50:54,419
[inaudible].
It has to do with the voltage

718
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:57,539
that we apply,
which is not exactly flat.

719
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:01,751
And notice that the whole pulse
goes from here to here,

720
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:06,197
lasts about ten milliseconds.
The moment that the magnetic

721
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:10,418
field
reaches a maximum and remains

722
00:51:10,418 --> 00:51:14,176
constant, there is no longer any
induced current.

723
00:51:14,176 --> 00:51:17,307
Think about this.
Give this some thought.

724
00:51:17,307 --> 51:22
This is not easy.
And have a good weekend.
