1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
Today, I'm going to take a
critical look at Ampere's Law.

2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:08,246
Today, I'm going to take a
critical look at Ampere's Law.

3
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:14,283
I'm going to run a current
through a wire,

4
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:21,352
as we did before,
but now I'm going to also put a

5
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:29,745
capacitor in that line and so we
are charging a capacitor.

6
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:37,058
Here is that capacitor.
And here is the wire.

7
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:43,622
We are running a current I.
And as we are running this

8
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:48,948
current, clearly,
we get a changing electric

9
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:55,884
field inside the capacitor.
The electric field inside the

10
00:00:55,884 --> 00:01:02,2
capacitor, sigma free divided by
kappa epsilon zero,

11
00:01:02,2 --> 00:01:08,516
which is also Q free divided by
the area.

12
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:12,743
This is a circular plate
capacitor.

13
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:17,963
Capital R, is the radius of
this capacitor,

14
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:23,06
so we get pi R squared kappa
epsilon zero.

15
00:01:23,06 --> 00:01:30,269
But since I run a current the Q
free is building up all the

16
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:36,236
time, and so the current per
definition is dQ dT,

17
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:44,44
and so I now have ex- a
changing electric field inside,

18
00:01:44,44 --> 00:01:49,393
de dt, which is the current I
divided by pi R squared,

19
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:53,599
kappa  epsilon zero,
because I simply take the

20
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,337
derivative of this equation,
I get dQ dT,

21
00:01:57,337 --> 00:02:01,636
and dQ dT is I.
And only if the current is zero

22
00:02:01,636 --> 00:02:05,562
is there no changing electric
field inside.

23
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:09,487
So how does this affect the
magnetic field?

24
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:15,468
Well, if I take here a point P1
at a

25
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:20,576
distance little R from the
wire, if you fall away from this

26
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:26,035
capacitor it's hard to believe
that Ampere's Law would not give

27
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:29,909
the right answer.
And we will apply that very

28
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:34,4
shortly, Ampere's Law.
It's on the blackboard there.

29
00:02:34,4 --> 00:02:39,507
Suppose you are at the same
distance from this line here at

30
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:43,029
point P2.
Well, yeah, you've got to admit

31
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:47,282
there's an
interruption of current now.

32
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:51,577
There is no current going
through this space and so you

33
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:56,19
expect that the magnetic field
here would be a little lower

34
00:02:56,19 --> 00:02:59,531
perhaps than it is here.
But not very much.

35
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,269
So the question is,
how can we now calculate the

36
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,962
magnetic field here and there,
now that we have this opening

37
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:11,303
in the wire.
Well, Biot-Savart could handle

38
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:15,2
it but I wouldn't know how to do
it

39
00:03:15,2 --> 00:03:19,967
because if there's a current
flowing like this there's also a

40
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,859
current going up on these
plates, and one like so,

41
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:27,355
and I wouldn't know how to
apply Biot-Savart.

42
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:30,135
In principle,
yeah, but in practice,

43
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,201
no.
How about Ampere's Law?

44
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:35,06
Well, let's give Ampere's Law a
shot.

45
00:03:35,06 --> 00:03:39,827
This is a cylindrical symmetric
problem, so I choose a closed

46
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:44,116
loop, which of course itself is
a circle with radius R,

47
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:50,207
and I apply -- I attach to this
closed loop an open surface.

48
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:54,111
That's mandatory.
And I give myself an easy time,

49
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:58,421
I make it a flat surface.
So now I apply Ampere's Law.

50
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:01,186
You see it there on the
blackboard.

51
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:05,903
Anywhere on that closed loop,
the magnetic fields will have

52
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:09,319
the same strength,
for reasons of symmetry,

53
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,955
and so we get B times two pi R
equals mu zero times I pen,

54
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:20,704
and pen means the current that
penetrates my open surface.

55
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:25,401
Well, that's I.
I goes right through that

56
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:29,746
surface.
And so the magnetic fields at

57
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:35,618
that point, P1 mu zero times I
divided by two pi R.

58
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:39,845
We've seen this several times
before.

59
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:45,717
Now I wonder about P2.
Can I apply Ampere's Law for

60
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:51,61
point P2?
Well, yeah, you can try.

61
00:04:51,61 --> 00:04:56,17
So now I attach a closed loop
to this  point.

62
00:04:56,17 --> 00:04:59,176
Circle again,
radius little R,

63
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:04,565
and I use this flat surface and
I apply Ampere's Law.

64
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:10,369
Well, I'm in for a shock,
because B times two pi R is not

65
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:16,691
changing but there is no current
that penetrates that surface.

66
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:23,47
And so I is zero,
and so I have to conclude that

67
00:05:23,47 --> 00:05:28,956
the magnetic field at point P2
is zero which is absurd.

68
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:33,121
Couldn't be.
I can make the situation even

69
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:36,778
worse.
I'm going to revisit point P1,

70
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:41,755
and here is my capacitor,
and here is my point P1.

71
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:47,038
My current is flowing like so.
Here's my closed loop.

72
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:54,704
According to Ampere's Law,
int- closed loop integral B dot

73
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:57,504
DL.
Why should I choose a flat

74
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:00,98
surface?
I'm entitled to any surface!

75
00:06:00,98 --> 00:06:06,29
I like surfaces like this.
They are attached to a closed

76
00:06:06,29 --> 00:06:10,635
loop, so I will choose that kind
of a surface.

77
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:16,042
The surface now goes like so.
[whistle] Right through the

78
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:21,353
capacitor plates,
and I apply Ampere's Law,

79
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:24,083
so it's open here.
B times two pi R,

80
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,125
the radius is little R.
Mu zero times I,

81
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,557
but there is no I going through
that surface.

82
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,302
Nowhere through this surface is
a current poking,

83
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:38,514
because there is no current
going between the capacitor

84
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:42,883
plates, so now I have to
conclude that the magnetic field

85
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:47,407
at P1, which we first concluded
was this, is now also zero.

86
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:52,555
So something stinks.
So Ampere's Law is inadequate.

87
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:55,79
And so of course,
Faraday and Ampere were both

88
00:06:55,79 --> 00:06:59,384
perfectly aware of this.
But yet it was Maxwell who

89
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:03,768
zeroed in on this and he argued
that any open surface that you

90
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:07,722
attach to a closed loop should
give you exactly the same

91
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:11,1
result, same answer.
And so he suggested that we

92
00:07:11,1 --> 00:07:14,406
amend Ampere's Law,
and so he asked himself the

93
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:18,575
question, what is so special
about in-between the capacitor

94
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:22,959
plates?
Well, what is special there is

95
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,64
in-between the capacitor plates
there is a changing electric

96
00:07:28,64 --> 00:07:31,24
field.
And Maxwell reasoned,

97
00:07:31,24 --> 00:07:36,631
gee, Faraday's Law tells me
that a changing magnetic flux

98
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:42,312
gives rise to an electric field,
so he says maybe a changing

99
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:46,548
electric flux gives rise to a
magnetic field.

100
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:52,422
And I want to remind you what
an electric flux is.

101
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:57,044
Phi of e is the integral.
In this case it would an open

102
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:00,982
surface  of E dot DA.
That is an electric flux.

103
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:05,519
With Gauss's Law that you see
on the blackboard there,

104
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,056
we had a closed surface.
I'm talking now about an open

105
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,796
surface.
That is an open surface.

106
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:17,247
This is an open surface,
and this is an open surface.

107
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:22,041
And so Maxwell suggested that
we have to add a term which

108
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:28,633
contains
the derivative of the electric

109
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:33,461
flux.
And that's what I'm going to do

110
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:38,691
there now, walking over to
Ampere's Law.

111
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:45,799
I'm going to amend it in a way
that Maxwell suggested.

112
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:51,029
He adds a term here,
epsilon zero kappa,

113
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:58,003
ddT, of the integral over an
open surface,

114
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:02,173
attached to that closed loop
of E dot DA.

115
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:05,718
This current,
which is the one that

116
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:11,14
penetrates, remember,
through the surface is really a

117
00:09:11,14 --> 00:09:14,059
real current.
This term here,

118
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:17,812
Maxwell called "displacement
current.

119
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:23,026
I want to make sure that I have
no slip of the pen,

120
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:28,552
because I hate slips of the
pen.

121
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:32,753
That is correct.
I have everything in place.

122
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:38,617
You may think now that we can
start a party  because all four

123
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:42,135
Maxwell's equations are now in
place.

124
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:45,946
Not quite.
We're going to make one small

125
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:51,907
adjustment after spring break,
and that adjustment is going to

126
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:56,792
be made in this one,
and then we'll have our party.

127
00:09:56,792 --> 00:10:04,806
So now, I would like to use the
new law and see whether we can

128
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:09,062
clean up that mess.
So I'm going to revisit my

129
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:14,738
point P1 and I'm going to apply
the new law by first having a

130
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:18,9
flat surface,
that surface that we have here,

131
00:10:18,9 --> 00:10:24,103
and then trying this surface.
And I want to get the same

132
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:26,846
answer.
If I use that surface,

133
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:31,86
do we agree that there is a
current going through that

134
00:10:31,86 --> 00:10:37,489
surface but there
is no electric flux going

135
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:42,066
through that surface?
So that second term,

136
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:48,876
that displacement current term,
is zero for that flat surface.

137
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:52,672
So this answer is completely
valid.

138
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:56,58
But now, I want to pursue this
case.

139
00:10:56,58 --> 00:11:02,72
And so I'll make a new drawing.
We have here this point,

140
00:11:02,72 --> 00:11:07,52
P1.
This is my radius little R.

141
00:11:07,52 --> 00:11:12,647
This is my surface going right
through here.

142
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:17,893
Here's the current I,
and here is my changing

143
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:23,258
electric field.
And so I get B times two pi R,

144
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:25,881
mu zero.
I pen is zero.

145
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:31,603
There is no current penetrating
through this bag.

146
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:38,279
This is open here.
So the first part is zero.

147
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:44,38
So I only deal with the second
part, which is epsilon zero K,

148
00:11:44,38 --> 00:11:50,378
kappa, displacement  current.
And now I have to put in there

149
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:54,648
d phi e dt.
Phi E is very easy to calculate

150
00:11:54,648 --> 00:12:00,545
because E and da right here-
think of this part being flat.

151
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:06,238
Wherever you were inside the
capacitor, if we assume that

152
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:10,778
there are no
[inaudible] fields,

153
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:15,405
then there is an electric field
only where you're inside the

154
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:19,796
capacitor, and so the electric
flux is simply E times the

155
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:22,698
surface area,
E and da are in the same

156
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:27,481
direction, so it is the electric
field times this pi capital R

157
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,206
squared.
And therefore,

158
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,343
if I want to know what the
derivative is,

159
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:36,891
then I get this pi R squared
which is that surface area and

160
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:42,62
now I need there de dt.
And the de dt we have,

161
00:12:42,62 --> 00:12:48,81
that is I divided by pi R
square kappa epsilon zero.

162
00:12:48,81 --> 00:12:54,151
I divided by pi R squared kappa
epsilon zero.

163
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:59,006
So this is the area A,
and this is de dt,

164
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:05,924
and this is the area of the
part inside the capacitor that

165
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:13,722
has a flux going through it,
cause outside here there is no

166
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:17,561
flux going through there,
so there's no contribution.

167
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:20,219
There's no contribution here,
either.

168
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:22,877
There's no contribution here,
either.

169
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:25,904
The electric field is only
existent there.

170
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:29,743
That's my assumption.
And so the whole thing here  is

171
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,548
now d phi E dt.
Well, let's look at our

172
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:34,025
results.
I lose a pi,

173
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:37,494
I lose my R squared,
I lose my kappa and epsilon

174
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:41,038
zero, and look what I get.
I get mu zero times I.

175
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:46,943
That is truly amazing,
so I find now that B equals mu

176
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:51,596
zero times I divided by two pi
little R, which is exactly what

177
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,731
we had before.
Hooray for Mr.

178
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:58,459
Maxwell, because now it doesn't
matter anymore whether you take

179
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:02,501
the flat surface or whether you
take the back surface.

180
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:05,552
You now get the same answer.
In one case,

181
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:10,051
there is no contribution from
the displacement current term,

182
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:14,627
and in the other case there is
no contribution from the first

183
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:20,27
term, the real current.
Let me make sure whether I'm

184
00:14:20,27 --> 00:14:24,748
happy with my results.
Yup, I think that's fine.

185
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:30,084
We can now also go one step
further, and we can calculate

186
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:34,849
anywhere in between the
capacitor what the magnetic

187
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:38,374
field is.
I'll make another drawing of

188
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:41,233
the capacitor.
It's right here.

189
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:45,807
I have this E field.
I will not repeat that every

190
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:50,392
time.
And here I have my point P2

191
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:55,94
now, which is inside the
capacitor at a radius little R

192
00:14:55,94 --> 00:14:59,844
from the center.
And this is capital R,

193
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:04,262
circular plates.
I have here my closed loop.

194
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:07,344
It's a circle,
radius little R.

195
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:11,556
I apply now the new law,
B times two pi R.

196
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:15,049
And there we go.
We have a mu zero,

197
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:20,327
we have an epsilon zero,
we have a kappa.

198
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:23,505
There's no current going
through here,

199
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,682
so it's non-negotiable.
I pen is zero,

200
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:29,344
right?
That's not even an issue.

201
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:32,006
So we get mu zero,
epsilon zero.

202
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:35,698
I get kappa.
But now, the surface area right

203
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:39,906
here is not pi capital R
squared, where there is a

204
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:44,199
changing electric field,
but it is only pi little R

205
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,119
squared.
I take a flat surface now.

206
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:51,499
And so now we multiply this by
pi

207
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:57,023
little R squared,
and then of course de dt is the

208
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:04,044
same, so we get our current I
divided by pi capital R squared,

209
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:10,835
divided by kappa epsilon zero.
And now you're again losing a

210
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:14,403
lot.
You lose your epsilon zero,

211
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:18,086
you lose your kappa.
I lose a pi.

212
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:23,495
And look, I have a little R
here and

213
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:26,345
I have a l- little R square
there.

214
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:31,267
So now we're going to get a
result which is something that

215
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:35,843
you may actually have
anticipated, namely that you get

216
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:40,506
a- a field inside the capacitor
that is growing with R,

217
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:45,774
because if I make up my balance
I get upstairs mu zero times I

218
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:50,868
but I get one little R upstairs.
You see, you have R squared

219
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:57,512
here and you have R here.
And downstairs I get two pi and

220
00:16:57,512 --> 00:17:04,02
then I get a capital R squared,
and I believe that's correct.

221
00:17:04,02 --> 00:17:09,552
Let me check my notes.
And yes, I'm happy with that.

222
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:16,06
And this is proportional with
little R,  whereas here falling

223
00:17:16,06 --> 00:17:21,05
off one over R.
And so I can now make a plot of

224
00:17:21,05 --> 00:17:26,691
the magnetic field as a function
of

225
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:30,943
little R when I'm inside the
capacitor plates.

226
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:34,629
Little R, these are the
magnetic fields,

227
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:38,882
and this is the radius of the
capacitor plate.

228
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:43,512
It's going to be a straight
line up to that point,

229
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:49,183
and then it will fall off as
one over little R and you can do

230
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:54,664
your own work on that and it's
very trivial to calculate to

231
00:17:54,664 --> 00:18:00,329
demonstrate that when you go
beyond the edge of the

232
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,074
capacitor that then it falls off
as one over R,

233
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:07,574
just in the same way that point
P1 is doing.

234
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:11,807
So now we have a tool to
calculate the magnetic field

235
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:15,471
even inside capacitors while we
were charging,

236
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:19,215
which we didn't have before.
The strength here,

237
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:22,96
the maximum magnetic field
here, you'll find by

238
00:18:22,96 --> 00:18:26,542
substituting in there for little
R capital R.

239
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:31,751
And when you do this,
if this becomes capital R,

240
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:34,126
this becomes one over capital
R.

241
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:38,186
If you had substituted in here
for little R capital R,

242
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:40,79
you would've found the same
result.

243
00:18:40,79 --> 00:18:44,313
This part is not kosher.
It can not be correct,

244
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:46,994
and I can not make it right for
you.

245
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:51,513
And the reason why that part
can not be kosher is because we

246
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,577
have made the assumption,
which is wrong,

247
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:59,096
that there is no fringe field.
And so we have assumed in our

248
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:03,769
calculations that the electric
field

249
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,473
is only here  and there,
but it's zero here so that

250
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:09,771
there is nothing,
no de dt here,

251
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:12,661
no changing magnetic,
uh, electric flux.

252
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:16,365
And that's not true.
So clearly, when you get close

253
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,737
to the edge, this is not
correct.

254
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:21,775
And there's no way I can
correct for that,

255
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:26,221
because the fringe fields will
be different from capacitor to

256
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:30,963
capacitor and those calculations
of course are not even very easy

257
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:35,632
to make.
But Maxwell had introduced his

258
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,397
displacement current term.
He was a very smart man.

259
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:43,239
He predicted that as a
consequence of that term that

260
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:47,457
radio waves should exist.
There was a time that we didn't

261
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:51,9
know that radio waves existed.
He predicted their existence,

262
00:19:51,9 --> 00:19:55,139
but not only did he predict
their existence,

263
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:59,508
he even was able to calculate
what their speed was going to

264
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:01,617
be.
We call that the speed of

265
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,177
light.
And we will do that in a few

266
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:08,031
weeks
ourselves in eight oh two.

267
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:11,832
In 1879, which was the year
that Maxwell died,

268
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:16,647
the German physicist Helmholtz
asked once of his students,

269
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:21,885
Hertz- he was twenty-two years
at the time, he was a junior- to

270
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:25,94
try to demonstrate that radio
waves indeed exist.

271
00:20:25,94 --> 00:20:29,403
Hertz declined,
because he argued that the

272
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:34,472
equipment that was available at
the time was not good enough.

273
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:41,346
But seven years later when new
equipment had been  developed,

274
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:45,566
he accepted the challenge and
it took him two years,

275
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:50,612
but then he indeed was able to
demonstrate that radio waves do

276
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:53,342
exist.
Imagine what a victory that

277
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:55,41
was!
Someone like Maxwell,

278
00:20:55,41 --> 00:21:00,126
who predicts out of nothing
that radio waves should exist,

279
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:04,511
and here comes someone who
actually shows that they do

280
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:10,054
exist.
Hertz died five years after his

281
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:14,046
great  experiments.
He was thirty-seven years old.

282
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:17,794
He was very young.
Had he lived ten more years,

283
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:22,438
there is no doubt in my mind
that he would've been awarded

284
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:26,675
with the Nobel Prize for
physics, but the first Nobel

285
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:31,319
prize was only given in 1901,
so he died just a little bit

286
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,497
too early.
Maxwell also died very young,

287
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:37,838
age forty-eight.
Why did Maxwell call that

288
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:42,277
strange
term displacement current?

289
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:45,791
In the presence of a
dielectric, if you put a

290
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,624
dielectric in there,
the changing electric fields

291
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:53,537
will indeed cause a current
in-between the plates,

292
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:57,451
because the polarization will
change all the time.

293
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:01,364
You get a re-eras-
re-arrangement of these induced

294
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:05,916
charges, so there is indeed a
current, but in vacuum there

295
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:10,308
shouldn't be any current.
Any electric field changing or

296
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:13,688
not
changing will not cause a

297
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:16,892
current in vacuum.
But Maxwell believed that

298
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:20,544
vacuum in a way behaves like any
other dielectric,

299
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:24,493
just a special dielectric,
happened to be a dielectric

300
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:28,367
with kappa equals one.
And so he really believed that

301
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:32,242
there was an actual current
going between the plates,

302
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:36,191
even though we now know of
course that that is not the

303
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,352
case.
So the name displacement

304
00:22:38,352 --> 00:22:42,674
current was perhaps not a very
lucky one, but the term is a

305
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:46,815
must, and it
completes the theory of

306
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:51,207
electricity and magnetism.
The name is obviously of no

307
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:54,687
consequence.
After all, Shakespeare said it

308
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:58,499
himself, in Romeo and Juliet,
what's in a name?

309
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:03,057
Remember, what's in a name?
That which we call a rose by

310
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:05,957
any other name would smell as
sweet.

311
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:08,857
Those were the words by
Shakespeare.

312
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:12,752
I will abandon for now the
displacement current,

313
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:17,06
but we will revisit it later
when we

314
00:23:17,06 --> 00:23:22,171
will deal with radio waves and
with the propagation of

315
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:27,474
electromagnetic radiation,
and I will return now to good

316
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:33,356
old Faraday, and I will return
to electric generators that run

317
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:37,502
our economy.
We've discussed that at length,

318
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:41,648
and I want to revisit that to
you- with you.

319
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:47,24
Remember that if you rotate
conducting loops in

320
00:23:47,24 --> 00:23:51,765
magnetic fields.
that you create induced EMFs,

321
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:55,988
currents, and that keeps our
economy going.

322
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:59,205
Here is again one of those
loops.

323
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:03,428
Conducting wire,
and I don't care about the

324
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:09,059
direction of the magnetic field.
If you want it this way,

325
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,879
that's fine.
What matters is that we're

326
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:17,705
going to rotate it about this
axis,

327
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:23,714
and as we rotate it about this
axis we're going to get an

328
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:27,255
induced EMF.
And that induced EMF,

329
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:31,976
which we derived I think it was
last lecture,

330
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:37,019
as a function of time,
will be a sinusoidal or a

331
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,56
cosinusoidal curve,
and therefore,

332
00:24:40,56 --> 00:24:46,783
will look something like this.
I call this loop number one,

333
00:24:46,783 --> 00:24:53,651
and so this is the EMF produced
by loop number one.

334
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:57,771
But now I'm going to add two
more loops which are not

335
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:01,099
electrically connected
physically separate.

336
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,695
If you look from this direction
you will see the following.

337
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:10,449
This would be your loop number
one, because you're looking in

338
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:14,887
this direction and you would
only see the conducting wire

339
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,819
like so.
I have now a second one which

340
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:22,573
is rotated hundred and twenty
degrees, and so in this picture

341
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:25,605
you will see
it like so.

342
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:29,338
Look number two,
and this is hundred and twenty

343
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:32,34
degrees.
Physically hundred and twenty

344
00:25:32,34 --> 00:25:35,748
degree rotated.
And then I have a third one

345
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:39,724
which is again hundred and
twenty degrees rotated.

346
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:43,294
It is like so.
And so this angle here is also

347
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:48
hundred and twenty degrees and
so this angle is hundred and

348
00:25:48 --> 00:25:51,327
twenty degrees.
And this is my look number

349
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:54,167
three.
And so each one of those will

350
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:58,874
give an EMF that has this shape
but they

351
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:04,718
are offset now in phase by a
hundred twenty degrees.

352
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:10,562
And so they're all rotating in
exactly the same way,

353
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:17,552
like so, and so the second one
will give me an EMF if I try to

354
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:22,365
estimate that roughly,
something like this,

355
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:29,011
so this is loop number two.
It comes a little later in time

356
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:35,542
and number three will again be
offset,

357
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:39,006
will look like this.
Number three.

358
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:43,938
And what we- we call this a
three phase current.

359
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:49,815
And a three phase current can
produce a rotating magnetic

360
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:53,383
field.
We will make one for you but

361
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:57,581
I'll first explain to you how
that works.

362
00:26:57,581 --> 00:27:02,303
So if the period of number one
is sixty Hertz,

363
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:07,026
then the period of number two
is

364
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:11,09
also sixty Hertz,
and number three is also sixty

365
00:27:11,09 --> 00:27:16,106
Hertz, but they're just offset
in terms of the phase angle.

366
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:20,517
Suppose you're looking down
onto a horizontal table,

367
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:25,446
so this is a horizontal table.
And I have here a solenoid.

368
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:28,3
This is one and the same
solenoid.

369
00:27:28,3 --> 00:27:33,403
When the current runs clockwise
here it will also run s- run

370
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,43
clockwise there.
But it's open here.

371
00:27:36,43 --> 00:27:40,494
Going to put something in
there.

372
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:45,646
We call this number one.
Then I have another one which

373
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:50,993
is rotated, physically rotated a
hundred twenty degrees.

374
00:27:50,993 --> 00:27:53,034
It's here.
Also coils.

375
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:58,769
And I'm going to feed current
number two through those coals

376
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:03,24
later, through those coils.
This is number two.

377
00:28:03,24 --> 00:28:08,781
And I have a third one and I'm
going to run current number

378
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:11,922
three
through those.

379
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:15,202
So here are coils,
here are coils,

380
00:28:15,202 --> 00:28:20,271
this is number three.
And so one sees current number

381
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:25,737
one, two sees current number
two, and three sees current

382
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:30,011
number three.
At the moment that the current

383
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:35,875
through number one reaches a
maximum, the current in two and

384
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:39,155
three are down by a factor of
two.

385
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:44,026
You can check that [break in
tape].

386
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:48,439
During my lecture I went a
little bit too fast over the

387
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:52,688
part that is coming up now,
so I'm going to redo it a

388
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:55,549
little slower to make it more
clear.

389
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:59,716
When the current through loop
one reaches a maximum,

390
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:04,048
let's say then that the
magnetic field due to loop one

391
00:29:04,048 --> 00:29:08,052
is in this direction.
The current through this one

392
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:12,547
and the current through this
loop are two times smaller.

393
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:18,484
You may want to check that.
But it just so happens that the

394
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:23,169
vectorial sum of the magnetic
field produced by loop number

395
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:27,45
two and by loop number three
also happen to be in this

396
00:29:27,45 --> 00:29:32,055
direction, so the net magnetic
field is in this direction.

397
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:36,094
Let's now look one third of a
period later in time.

398
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:40,375
Now, the current in loop number
two reaches a maximum,

399
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:44,091
so its magnetic field is now in
this direction,

400
00:29:44,091 --> 00:29:49,538
and you guessed it of course,
that it just so happens that

401
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:53,345
the vectorial sum of the
magnetic field produced by the

402
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:56,517
other two loops is now also in
this direction.

403
00:29:56,517 --> 00:30:00,182
And if we now look again one
third of a period later,

404
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:04,411
when the current through loop
number three reaches a maximum,

405
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:08,429
then the magnetic fields will
be in this direction and the

406
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:12,447
vectorial sum of the magnetic
field of the other two loops

407
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:17,875
will also be in this direction.
And look now what has happened.

408
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:22,745
In one complete period,
the magnetic fields started out

409
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:26,352
like this.
One third of a period later it

410
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:30,411
was like this,
and one third of a period later

411
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:34,65
it was like this.
So what we have created is now

412
00:30:34,65 --> 00:30:39,52
a rotating magnetic field,
and it rotates in one period

413
00:30:39,52 --> 00:30:43,759
all the way around,
three hundred sixty degrees.

414
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,99
OK, let's now go back to my
original lecture.

415
00:30:48,99 --> 00:30:53,227
[break in tape] rotates once
around in the period of your

416
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,557
alternating current.
If that is a sixty Hertz

417
00:30:56,557 --> 00:31:00,493
current, then it will rotate
around with sixty Hertz,

418
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:03,671
sixty times per second.
And so if we put a,

419
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:07,152
a magnet in here,
then this magnet will want to

420
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:11,617
go around [inaudible] wants to
follow this rotating magnetic

421
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:14,342
field.
And we call that a synchronous

422
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,461
motor.
So the rotor of such a

423
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:20,913
synchronous
motor itself would be a magnet

424
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:24,957
and it would rotate around with
the frequency of your

425
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:28,534
alternating current.
But you need a three-phase

426
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:32,501
current for that so that the
magnetic field rotates.

427
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:36,623
I can also place in here --
this is again a horizontal

428
00:31:36,623 --> 00:31:40,745
surface, you have it here,
you're going to do it right

429
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:43,467
here.
Here is that -- here are those

430
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:46,577
crazy loops with the three-phase
current.

431
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:51,321
We can also put in here um
conducting sphere,

432
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:54,631
or in my case I will use a
conducting egg.

433
00:31:54,631 --> 00:31:58,021
And when the magnetic field
rotates around,

434
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:02,863
there's a continuous magnetic
flux change with the surface of

435
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:07,625
that conducting sphere or egg,
and so it's going to run cur-

436
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,693
eddy currents.
Now, if you have an eddy

437
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:14,809
current going around,
and you have a magnetic field,

438
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:19,813
then the magnetic field in the
area current will cause a torque

439
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,302
on the current.
In a similar way,

440
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:26,944
when we discussed earlier the
idea of a motor that you were

441
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:29,769
going to build,
there was a magnetic field and

442
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:33,537
there was a current and that
caused a torque and the same way

443
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,99
you get a torque on the eddy
current and so it starts to

444
00:32:36,99 --> 00:32:39
torque up this conducting
sphere.

445
00:32:39 --> 00:32:42,39
And all the time there will be
eddy current because the

446
00:32:42,39 --> 00:32:45,907
magnetic fields keep going
around, and so you're going to

447
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:49,549
get a torque which will always
be in the same direction and

448
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:54,384
this conducting object will now
start to rotate and we call

449
00:32:54,384 --> 00:32:58,296
that an induction motor.
Induction motors have no

450
00:32:58,296 --> 00:33:01,23
brushes.
How fast the induction motor

451
00:33:01,23 --> 00:33:04,49
will go depends on the
conducting object.

452
00:33:04,49 --> 00:33:08,076
If it is a sphere,
it will probably come very

453
00:33:08,076 --> 00:33:12,885
close to sixty Hertz because a
sphere has many possibilities

454
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:17,694
for eddy currents to run around,
whereas if you take a ring,

455
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:21,85
and we will try that,
if you try to spin a ring in a

456
00:33:21,85 --> 00:33:26,414
rotating magnetic field then of
course then of course the

457
00:33:26,414 --> 00:33:30,95
various
paths that are available for

458
00:33:30,95 --> 00:33:36,57
eddy currents are very limited
and only go around in the ring.

459
00:33:36,57 --> 00:33:41,453
Many of the stationary tools
that you find in people's

460
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:46,152
workshops and in the basements
are induction motors.

461
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:51,68
A table saw and drill presses,
also electric grass mowers are

462
00:33:51,68 --> 00:33:55,826
induction motors.
I want to demonstrate now to

463
00:33:55,826 --> 00:34:00,34
you what three-phase currents
can do,

464
00:34:00,34 --> 00:34:06,172
and the first thing I'm going
to do is show you that unit that

465
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:12,195
we have here which is the- which
are the coils that I described,

466
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:17,644
through which we are going to
run the three-phase current.

467
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:21,659
Must get my lights right.
There you see it.

468
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,197
Coils are wound in a very
strange way.

469
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:30,264
After class,
you can come a little closer,

470
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:34,524
and so in here you would have a
rotating magnetic field.

471
00:34:34,524 --> 00:34:38,01
We use sixty Hertz,
which rotates around sixty

472
00:34:38,01 --> 00:34:41,573
times per second.
And the first thing I'm going

473
00:34:41,573 --> 00:34:45,137
to do is something wild,
a little bit in style,

474
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:47,848
I suppose.
I will put on top there a

475
00:34:47,848 --> 00:34:50,559
cardboard cover with little
magnets.

476
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,743
They're randomly oriented.
There's no way that they can

477
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:58,074
ever rotate.
They th- thee- are these little

478
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:02,567
magnets, flat,
a lot of friction.

479
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,977
If I expose them to a rotating
magnetic field,

480
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:10,31
then they will go nuts.
I told you,

481
00:35:10,31 --> 00:35:15,015
they were going nuts.
You're not supposed to show

482
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:17,466
these to students,
but OK.

483
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:20,602
Now here I have a conducting
egg.

484
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:25,797
And this now has ample
possibilities for eddy currents

485
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:32,266
to flow, and so now if I give
these coils the

486
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:35,341
right current,
a three-phase current,

487
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:39,098
it's spun up,
the magnetic fields acts on the

488
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:42,599
eddy currents,
and it starts to spin and I

489
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,698
have actually tried to measure
the rotation rate.

490
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:51,053
It's only a little bit under
thirty-six hundred RPM.

491
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:54,725
Thirty-six hundred RPM would be
sixty Hertz.

492
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:59,165
It's very close to that.
If I spin this object in the

493
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:04,719
direction in which the magnetic
field is not rotating,

494
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,64
then it says sorry,
no way.

495
00:36:06,64 --> 00:36:10,113
It just rehearses,
because the magnetic field is

496
00:36:10,113 --> 00:36:14,029
going to slave it in the
direction that it wants it to

497
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:16,32
go.
So we're looking there at an

498
00:36:16,32 --> 00:36:18,906
induction motor.
I have here a ring.

499
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:23,487
Now a ring doesn't have as many
possibilities for eddy currents

500
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:26,295
to run.
Could only go around like this,

501
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,698
or like this,
right?

502
00:36:27,698 --> 00:36:31,688
But I can still make it spin
probably if I do the right

503
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:34,563
thing.
First of all,

504
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:37,643
I have to rotate it in the
right direction,

505
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:39,99
which would be this one,
I think.

506
00:36:39,99 --> 00:36:43,144
There it goes.
It doesn't go anywhere nearly

507
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:47,324
as fast as the egg because of
the restrictive paths of the

508
00:36:47,324 --> 00:36:49,451
eddy currents.
But it rotates.

509
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:53,484
It's trying to follow that
magnetic field to the best it

510
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:56,345
can, but its abilities are very
limited.

511
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:59,718
And needless to say,
if I try to spin it in the

512
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,165
wrong direction,
that of course it will stop and

513
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:07,237
it
has no way like the egg to

514
00:37:07,237 --> 00:37:12,342
reverse its direction because of
its peculiar geometry.

515
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:16,312
I owe you an explanation to the
secret top.

516
00:37:16,312 --> 00:37:19,81
If you haven't found one
yourself yet.

517
00:37:19,81 --> 00:37:25,483
Let me first come to a simple
conclusion, and all of you must

518
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:30,966
have come to that conclusion.
That top, when I showed it to

519
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:37,867
you during my exam review was
spinning for more than an hour.

520
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:40,125
In fact, it was spinning the
next day.

521
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,116
Energy has to come from
somewhere, and so the only

522
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:46,716
conclusion that you could've
drawn that the energy came from

523
00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:49,462
inside the box,
there must be something inside

524
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:51,842
the box.
Clearly there must be a battery

525
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:55,198
in that box, and there is.
But that doesn't tell you how

526
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:57,273
it works yet.
And I can assure you,

527
00:37:57,273 --> 00:38:00,996
I can a- a- admit that it took
me quite a while before I fully

528
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:04,23
understand how it works.
And I want to explain that to

529
00:38:04,23 --> 00:38:07,708
you, and then I will demonstrate
it to

530
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:12,612
you again.
Remember what it looks like.

531
00:38:12,612 --> 00:38:18,806
In the top itself  is a magnet.
So here is a top.

532
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:26,161
Let's say this is north and
this is south and this is that

533
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:29
top.
We're rotating it.

534
00:38:29 --> 00:38:33,258
We're spinning it.
Inside the box,

535
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:41,516
right at the center of the box,
is a solenoid.

536
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:44,068
The switch and a nine-volt
battery.

537
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:47,745
Inside this solenoid is also a
little bit of iron.

538
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:50,747
We have not discussed that in
our course.

539
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:53,598
It's not important for the
explanation.

540
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:58,026
You'll later understand why
there is also some iron in here.

541
00:38:58,026 --> 00:39:02,078
It makes the magnetic fields so
it's a little stronger.

542
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:06,58
This is right at the center of
the- of the little platform on

543
00:39:06,58 --> 00:39:10,332
which I was running this.
It is a concave platform,

544
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:14,235
and here is a little plastic
nod so

545
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:17,499
when the top hits it it bounces
off.

546
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:22,722
Imagine for now that it's
rotating in such a way that the

547
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:28,412
North Pole is approaching that
solenoid, coming in from above.

548
00:39:28,412 --> 00:39:32,515
What's going to happen now,
in this solenoid,

549
00:39:32,515 --> 00:39:36,433
in this coil,
you are changing the magnetic

550
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:42,216
flux through the surface of this
coil and so you're introducing

551
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:46,693
an induced EMF,
an induced current.

552
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:51,992
And this current is sensed by a
transistor which I have not put

553
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:56,95
in here, and the transistor
throws the switch and now sucks

554
00:39:56,95 --> 00:40:00,625
energy out of the battery and
runs currents,

555
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:05,839
very high current through this
coil, such that the top becomes

556
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,515
the south pole.
Remember if you have a coil,

557
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:14,302
and you run current through
here, that you get a magnetic

558
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:17,477
field like so.
In this case,

559
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:21,012
this would be north pole and
this would be south pole.

560
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:24,814
If you reverse the current,
then this is south and this is

561
00:40:24,814 --> 00:40:27,215
north.
That magnetic field that comes

562
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:31,35
out there is fanning out in all
directions three dimensionally.

563
00:40:31,35 --> 00:40:34,752
It's going like this and it's
fanning out like this.

564
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:38,22
So when it approaches this
coil, there is a change in

565
00:40:38,22 --> 00:40:41,155
magnetic flux.
And this becomes a south pole.

566
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:44,557
The north pole is being
attracted by the south pole.

567
00:40:44,557 --> 00:40:48,437
I make you look at this
from above now.

568
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:52,713
Here is the top seen from
above, so it's spinning in this

569
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:55,462
direction.
And let's say here is this

570
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:58,211
coil.
This is the north pole and this

571
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:01,8
is the south pole.
And I just discussed with you

572
00:41:01,8 --> 00:41:06,611
that the current that's going to
flow from the battery will make

573
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:10,123
this a south pole.
The current can only flow in

574
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:14,018
that coil in one direction.
That's just the way it's

575
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,843
designed.
So whenever the current goes

576
00:41:16,843 --> 00:41:21,119
it's always this becomes a south
pole.

577
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,997
The north pole is being
attracted by the south pole.

578
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:29,918
You'll notice it's going to be
torqued up.

579
00:41:29,918 --> 00:41:33,648
So far, so good.
A little later in time,

580
00:41:33,648 --> 00:41:38,43
looking from above,
the north pole will be here and

581
00:41:38,43 --> 00:41:43,785
the south pole will be there,
it has rotated a little bit

582
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:48,95
further, and the coil is here.
So now the north pole is

583
00:41:48,95 --> 00:41:52,393
leaving.
It's receding.

584
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:54,851
It's not approaching,
it's receding.

585
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:59,065
If this were to remain a south
pole, that would be disastrous

586
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:03,279
because south poles and north
poles would attract each other.

587
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:06,58
You don't want that.
Well, the transistor senses

588
00:42:06,58 --> 00:42:09,601
that the EMF in the coil
reverses direction.

589
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:13,745
It has to reverse direction,
because if the north pole comes

590
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:18,029
in, the EMF is in one direction
but when the north pole leaves

591
00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:22,313
the EMF of course goes in the
other direction.

592
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:26,665
You've got a reversal.
And so what the transistor

593
00:42:26,665 --> 00:42:31,651
does, it opens the switch,
and so there is no north pole

594
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:37,362
here and there is no south pole
here, and so the thing starts to

595
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:41,804
go around further.
What happens now when the south

596
00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:47,244
pole approaches that solenoid?
OK, here is the situation that

597
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:50,235
the south pole is now
approaching.

598
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,046
It's rotating in this
direction.

599
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:58,576
And here is the coil.
South pole is coming in.

600
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,942
From Faraday's point of view,
there is no difference between

601
00:43:01,942 --> 00:43:04,966
the north pole receding or the
south pole approaching.

602
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:07,59
You should be able to reason
that for yourself.

603
00:43:07,59 --> 00:43:10,842
That's exactly the same thing,
and so the transistor knows

604
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:13,98
that indeed the current is still
in the wrong direction.

605
00:43:13,98 --> 00:43:16,319
It keeps the switch open.
It does nothing,

606
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,743
so as the south pole approaches
no current through this coil.

607
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:22,424
We must remember,
the current can only go in one

608
00:43:22,424 --> 00:43:24,821
direction, can only make this a
south pole.

609
00:43:24,821 --> 00:43:28,073
It could have been designed in
such a way that the current

610
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:31,34
could go in
both directions.

611
00:43:31,34 --> 00:43:34,583
It would have made it more
expensive.

612
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:39,357
Just a matter of economy.
So nothing will happen here.

613
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:44,581
But now, there comes a time
that the south pole is leaving,

614
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:48,094
is receding,
and so let us have here our

615
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:50,706
coil.
A south pole receding is

616
00:43:50,706 --> 00:43:54,94
exactly the same for Mr.
Faraday as a north pole

617
00:43:54,94 --> 00:43:58,543
approaching.
And so now the EMF is in the

618
00:43:58,543 --> 00:44:02,459
same
direction in the coil as it was

619
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:04,847
here.
And so now the transistor says

620
00:44:04,847 --> 00:44:07,986
yippee, that's fine.
I close the switch and I'm

621
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:11,875
going to run a current and so
this becomes the south pole.

622
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:15,9
South pole and south pole repel
each other, so now the thing

623
00:44:15,9 --> 00:44:18,629
gets a kick again.
So when the north pole

624
00:44:18,629 --> 00:44:22,518
approaches, it pulls on the
north pole, and when the south

625
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:25,315
pole recedes,
it pushes on the south pole.

626
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:29,477
And so it is an induction motor
which is only powered half per

627
00:44:29,477 --> 00:44:32,451
full
rotation, but a very,

628
00:44:32,451 --> 00:44:35,96
very clever design.
And I'm going to demonstrate it

629
00:44:35,96 --> 00:44:38,977
to you again.
I want you to see that as this

630
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:42,766
top approaches the center that
actually, you can see it

631
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:46,345
starting spinning up.
It really gets its energy when

632
00:44:46,345 --> 00:44:49,222
it gets close to this coil.
It also works,

633
00:44:49,222 --> 00:44:52,379
doesn't matter in which
direction you spin it.

634
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:55,607
That's also great.
You can spin it clockwise or

635
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:58,273
counter-clockwise.
Makes no difference.

636
00:44:58,273 --> 00:45:02,063
And so, you're going to see
that top

637
00:45:02,063 --> 00:45:04,298
here, I think.
There it is.

638
00:45:04,298 --> 00:45:08,682
And this is probably the best
way for you to see it.

639
00:45:08,682 --> 00:45:13,41
We have here this box in which
there is this very simple

640
00:45:13,41 --> 00:45:16,935
circuit, very simple,
and here is the top.

641
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:21,749
Has little bar magnet in it.
I will try to spin it just a

642
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:26,305
little bit, to make you see that
it actually spins up.

643
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:32,065
It may not be so easy for you
to see, but I can s- ah,

644
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,511
you see it's really spinning up
now.

645
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:37,656
And then it loses to friction,
rotation rates.

646
00:45:37,656 --> 00:45:41,571
It always comes back to the
center because the surface is

647
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:45,975
concave, and then it gets to the
center there and gets its kicks

648
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:49,47
again, gets spun up.
And this can go on for as long

649
00:45:49,47 --> 00:45:52,825
as your battery lasts,
which is about a few days.

650
00:45:52,825 --> 00:45:55,411
I can also rotate it
counterclockwise.

651
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:57,368
It's not so easy,
it's funny.

652
00:45:57,368 --> 00:46:01,073
Have you ever tried to rotate a
top counter-clockwise?

653
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:05,359
It's very hard!
I don't know why that is,

654
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,263
because maybe because I'm
right-handed.

655
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:10,325
I'll try.
You see, I failed.

656
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:14,222
Ah, this is a nice one.
I gave it a teeny-wee little

657
00:46:14,222 --> 00:46:16,055
spin.
It doesn't like it.

658
00:46:16,055 --> 00:46:19,646
It stays near the center.
Oh, doesn't like that.

659
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:23,161
It has to be a little bit away
from the center.

660
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:25,911
Ah, I think,
I think I've got it now.

661
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:26,981
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

662
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:30,495
Too optimistic.
Isn't it strange that it's hard

663
00:46:30,495 --> 00:46:34,239
for a person to rotate something
counterclockwise?

664
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,531
OK, I did it.
Slowly coming in,

665
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:41,89
to friction now.
And when it gets close to the

666
00:46:41,89 --> 00:46:46,099
center, there it gets its kicks.
Now it's spinning up.

667
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:49,99
Ah, you can really see it now.
It's being spun up.

668
00:46:49,99 --> 00:46:52,214
You see that?
Really spun up.

669
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:56,423
I have another fantastic toy
for you, which is also an

670
00:46:56,423 --> 00:46:59,918
induction motor.
And that one you're going to

671
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:04,524
see there, first want to explain
to you how that one works.

672
00:47:04,524 --> 00:47:08,495
That's a real beauty.
It is an induction motor that

673
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:13,897
runs on a two-phase current.
Here we have solenoids.

674
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,716
It's this, this baby here,
big one.

675
00:47:16,716 --> 00:47:21,608
And we're going to run sixty
Hertz AC current through there,

676
00:47:21,608 --> 00:47:25,754
and here we have one,
also going to run sixty Hertz

677
00:47:25,754 --> 00:47:28,491
AC through there.
Here's the coil.

678
00:47:28,491 --> 00:47:31,725
This one is easy to show.
The other one,

679
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:35,041
very heavy.
These two currents are ninety

680
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:38,358
degrees out of phase.
Not hundred twenty,

681
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:42,255
but ninety.
So it's a two-phase

682
00:47:42,255 --> 00:47:45,041
current.
So when the current is maximum

683
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:48,339
through this one,
it is zero through this one.

684
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:52,956
When it is maximum through this
one, it's zero through this one.

685
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:57,281
Let's look at the moment that
the current is maximum through

686
00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:59,846
this one.
And let's say the magnetic

687
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:04,024
field is in this direction,
which is created by this coil.

688
00:48:04,024 --> 00:48:08,202
Then there is no current here.
But one quarter of a period

689
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:12,893
later, this one has no current
but this one does.

690
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:17,433
Let's assume that now the
magnetic field from this is in

691
00:48:17,433 --> 00:48:21,231
this direction.
And so what you're going to see

692
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:25,028
now is that again,
you have a rotating magnetic

693
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:29,321
field which goes like so.
And if I put in here a can,

694
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:31,963
a paint can,
we use a coffee can,

695
00:48:31,963 --> 00:48:35,843
it's right here,
and at the surface of that can,

696
00:48:35,843 --> 00:48:39,971
so I will draw the can here,
but it's really there.

697
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:45,406
At the surface of that can,
you're going to have eddy

698
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:49,892
currents, because you have
change of magnetic flux all the

699
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:54,299
time and these eddy currents
with the magnetic field will

700
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:58,706
cause a torque on this can.
And the torque will always be

701
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:02,955
in the same direction and the
thing is going to rotate.

702
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:06,497
So it's another example of an
induction motor.

703
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:10,353
It's a very cute one.
And I want to show it to you

704
00:49:10,353 --> 00:49:13,579
and for that you're going to see
it there.

705
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:17,436
Needless to say that the can is
a

706
00:49:17,436 --> 00:49:21,557
very special can,
Maxwell House coffee.

707
00:49:21,557 --> 00:49:24,485
Of course.
And you see that?

708
00:49:24,485 --> 00:49:29,365
Maxwell House.
All right, so let's see whether

709
00:49:29,365 --> 00:49:33,378
we can get this to run.
There it goes.

710
00:49:33,378 --> 00:49:39,885
Nice example of an induction
motor, and now I'm going to test

711
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:43,03
you.
I'm going to ask you what

712
00:49:43,03 --> 00:49:48,018
happens if I take this coil
here,

713
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,586
which I can do,
and flip over from here to

714
00:49:51,586 --> 00:49:54,457
here.
Who thinks that nothing will

715
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:57,415
happen?
And you're all afraid of me

716
00:49:57,415 --> 00:50:01,069
now, right?
Who thinks that it will come to

717
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:03,679
a grinding halt?
Grinding halt.

718
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,464
Who thinks that the direction
of the motor will reverse?

719
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,944
Good for you.
It's clear that when I flip

720
00:50:11,944 --> 00:50:15,772
this one over,
you can easily go through that

721
00:50:15,772 --> 00:50:19,252
for yourself,
that this magnetic field is

722
00:50:19,252 --> 00:50:23,464
then not
rotating this way,

723
00:50:23,464 --> 00:50:29,051
but is rotating that way,
and so clearly the motor will

724
00:50:29,051 --> 00:50:33,5
reverse direction.
I'm going to do that now.

725
00:50:33,5 --> 00:50:37,224
Watch it.
So it's torquing now in the

726
00:50:37,224 --> 00:50:42,397
opposite direction.
It's coming to a grinding halt.

727
00:50:42,397 --> 00:50:46,639
You were right.
The other people were also

728
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,088
right, because now it's
reversing direction.

729
00:50:51,088 --> 00:50:58,342
And you see there it goes.
Another striking example of an

730
00:50:58,342 --> 00:51:01,354
induction motor.
Next lecture,

731
00:51:01,354 --> 51:06
Friday, I'm going to elevate a
woman.
