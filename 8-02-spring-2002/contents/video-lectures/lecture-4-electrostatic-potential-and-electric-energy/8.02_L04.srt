1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,261



2
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:07,579
We're going to talk about again
some new concepts.

3
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:14,748
And that's the concept of
electrostatic potential

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:23,111
electrostatic potential energy.
For which we will use the

5
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:29,832
symbol U and independently
electric potential.

6
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:37,276
Which is very different,
for which we will use the

7
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:41,201
symbol V.
Imagine that I have a charge Q

8
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:44,924
one here and that's plus,
plus charge,

9
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:50,861
and here I have a charge plus Q
two and they have a distant,

10
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:55,591
they're a distance R apart.
And that is point P.

11
00:00:55,591 --> 00:01:01,528
It's very clear that in order
to bring these charges at this

12
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:07,164
distance from each other I had
to do work to

13
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:10,569
bring them there because they
repel each other.

14
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,938
It's like pushing in a spring.
If you release the spring you

15
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,27
get the energy back.
If they were -- they were

16
00:01:18,27 --> 00:01:22,786
connected with a little string,
the string would be stretched,

17
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:25,97
take scissors,
cut the string fweet they fly

18
00:01:25,97 --> 00:01:29,154
apart again.
So I have put work in there and

19
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:33,152
that's what we call the
electrostatic potential energy.

20
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:37,594
So let's work this out in some
detail how much work I have to

21
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:39,519
do.
Well,

22
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,607
we first put Q one here,
if space is empty,

23
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:45,988
this doesn't take any work to
place Q one here.

24
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:50,251
But now I come from very far
away, we always think of it as

25
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:53,853
infinitely far away,
of course that's a little bit

26
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:57,234
of exaggeration,
and we bring this charge Q two

27
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:00,91
from infinity to that point P.
And I, Walter Lewin,

28
00:02:00,91 --> 00:02:04,07
have to do work,
I have to push and push and

29
00:02:04,07 --> 00:02:08,04
push and the closer I get the
harder I have to push and

30
00:02:08,04 --> 00:02:11,47
finally I reach that
point P.

31
00:02:11,47 --> 00:02:15,824
Suppose I am here and this
separation is little R.

32
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:19,822
I've reached that point.
Then the force on me,

33
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:22,577
the electric force,
is outwards.

34
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:27,908
And so I have to overcome that
force and so my force F Walter

35
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:32,35
Lewin is in this direction.
And so you can see I do

36
00:02:32,35 --> 00:02:36,26
positive work,
the force and the direction in

37
00:02:36,26 --> 00:02:43,102
which I'm moving are in the same
direction, I do positive work.

38
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:47,616
Now, the work that I do could
be calculated.

39
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:53,915
The work that Walter Lewin is
doing in going all the way from

40
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:59,899
infinity to that location P is
the integral going from in-

41
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:05,778
infinity to radius R of the
force of Walter Lewin dot DR.

42
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:10,292
But of course that work is
exactly the same,

43
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:15,331
either one is fine,
to take the electric force in

44
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:18,695
going
from R to infinity.

45
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:20,636
Dot DR.
Because the force,

46
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:24,285
the electric force,
and Walter Lewin's force are

47
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:27,7
the same in magnitude but
opposite direction,

48
00:03:27,7 --> 00:03:31,504
and so by flipping over,
going from infinity to R,

49
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:34,144
to R to infinity,
this is the same.

50
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:38,801
This is one and the same thing.
Let's calculate this integral

51
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:43,459
because that's a little easy.
We know what the electric force

52
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,021
is, Coulomb's law,
it's repelling,

53
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:51,3
so the force and DR are now in
the same direction,

54
00:03:51,3 --> 00:03:56,677
so the angle theta between them
is zero, so the cosine of theta

55
00:03:56,677 --> 00:04:00,667
is one, so we can forget about
all the vectors,

56
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:04,743
and so we would get then that
this equals Q one,

57
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:08,039
Q two, divided by four pi
epsilon zero.

58
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,768
And now I have downstairs here
an R squared.

59
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:16,452
And so I have the integral now
DR divided by R squared.

60
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:21,396
From capital R to infinity.
And this integral is minus one

61
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:23,222
over
R.

62
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:27,426
Which I have to evaluate
between R and infinity.

63
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:32,346
And when I do that that becomes
plus one over capital R.

64
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:37,712
Right, the integral of DR over
R squared I'm sure you can all

65
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:42,631
do that is minus one over R.
I evaluate it between R and

66
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:46,12
infinity and so you get plus one
over R.

67
00:04:46,12 --> 00:04:51,486
And so U, which is the energy
that -- the work that I have to

68
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:56,406
do to bring this charge at that
position,

69
00:04:56,406 --> 00:05:00,995
that U is now Q one.
Times Q two divided by four pi

70
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:04,575
epsilon zero.
Divided by that capital R.

71
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:08,889
And this of course this is
scalar, that is work,

72
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,57
it's a number of joules.
If Q one and Q two are both

73
00:05:13,57 --> 00:05:18,068
positive or both ne- negative,
I do positive work,

74
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,015
you can see that,
minus times minus is plus.

75
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:25,136
Because then they repel each
other.

76
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:29,726
If one is positive and the
other is

77
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:33,642
negative, then I do negative
work, and you see that that

78
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:37,63
comes out as a sign sensitive,
minus times plus is minus,

79
00:05:37,63 --> 00:05:41,617
so I can do negative work.
If the two don't have the same

80
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:44,466
polarity.
I want you to convince yourself

81
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:48,667
that if I didn't come along a
straight line from all the way

82
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,658
from infinity,
but I came in a very crooked

83
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:55,005
way, finally ended up at point
P, at that point,

84
00:05:55,005 --> 00:06:00,416
that the amount of work that I
had to do is exactly the same.

85
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:04,257
You see the parallel with eight
oh one where we dealt with

86
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:06,885
gravity.
Gravity is a conservative force

87
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,715
and when you deal with
conservative forces,

88
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:13,623
the work that has to be done in
going from one point to the

89
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,779
other is independent of the
path.

90
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,744
That is the definition of
conservative force.

91
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,237
Electric forces are also
conservative.

92
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:25,078
And so it doesn't make any
difference whether I come along

93
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:28,784
a straight line to this point or
whether I do that in an

94
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:33,163
extremely crooked way and
finally end up here.

95
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:37,566
That's the same amount of work.
Now if we do have a collection

96
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,958
of charges, so we have pluses
and minus charges,

97
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,556
some pluses,
some minus, some pluses,

98
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:46,299
minus, pluses,
pluses, then you now can

99
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:49,835
calculate the amount of work
that I, Walter Lewin,

100
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:54,165
have to do in assembling that.
You bring one from infinity to

101
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,331
here, another one,
another one,

102
00:06:56,331 --> 00:07:00,3
and you add up all that work,
some work may be positive,

103
00:07:00,3 --> 00:07:04,197
some work may be negative.
Finally you h- arrive at the

104
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:09,847
total
amount of work that you have to

105
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:16,796
do to assemble these charges.
And that is the meaning of

106
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:20,84
capital U.
Now I turn to electric

107
00:07:20,84 --> 00:07:25,768
potential.
And for that I start off here

108
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:31,454
with a charge which I now call
plus capital Q.

109
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:36,761
It's located here.
And at a position P at a

110
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:42,982
distance R away
I place a test charge plus Q.

111
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:47,924
Make it positive for now,
you can change it later to

112
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:51,993
become a negative.
And so the electrostatic

113
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:57,903
potential energy we -- we know
already, we just calculated it,

114
00:07:57,903 --> 00:08:03,426
that would be Q times Q divided
by four pi epsilon zero R.

115
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:06,914
That's exactly the same that we
have.

116
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:14,943
So the electric potential,
electrostatic potential energy,

117
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:22,658
is the work that I have to do
to bring this charge here.

118
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:28,969
Now I'm going to introduce
electric potential.

119
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:35,701
Electric potential.
And that is the work per unit

120
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:43,025
charge that I have to do
to go from infinity to that

121
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:46,701
position.
So Q doesn't enter into it

122
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:50,692
anymore.
It is the work per unit charge

123
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:54,683
to go from infinity to that
location P.

124
00:08:54,683 --> 00:09:00,984
And so if it is the work per
unit charge, that means little Q

125
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:06,025
fweet disappears.
And so now we write down that V

126
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:09,491
at that location P,
the potential,

127
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:14,844
electric potential at
that location P,

128
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:19,459
is now only Q divided four pi
epsilon zero R.

129
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:24,178
Little Q has disappeared.
It is also a scalar.

130
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:29,317
This has unit joules.
The units here is joules per

131
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:33,407
coulombs.
I have divided out one charge.

132
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:38,965
It's work per unit charge.
No one would ever call this

133
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:44,418
joules per coulombs,
we call this volts,

134
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:48,876
called after the great Volta,
who did a lot of research on

135
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,987
this.
So we call this volts.

136
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:54,115
But it's the same as joules per
coulombs.

137
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:58,181
If we have a very simple
situation like we have here,

138
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,482
that we only have one charge,
then this is the potential

139
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:06,548
anywhere, at any distance you
want, from this charge.

140
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:09,363
If R goes up,
if you're further away,

141
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:11,787
the potential will become
lower.

142
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:15,853
If this Q is positive,
the potential is everywhere in

143
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:20,069
space
positive for a single charge.

144
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,7
If this Q is negative,
everywhere in space the

145
00:10:23,7 --> 00:10:27,412
potential is negative.
Electro- electric static

146
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:31,689
potential can be negative.
The work that I do per unit

147
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:35,32
charge coming from infinity
would be negative,

148
00:10:35,32 --> 00:10:39,677
if that's a negative charge.
And the potential when I'm

149
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:43,711
infinitely far away,
when this R becomes infinitely

150
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,745
large, is zero.
So that's the way we

151
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:52,035
define our zero.
So you can have positive

152
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:57,718
potentials, near positive
charge, negative potentials,

153
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:02,864
near negative charge,
and if you're very very far

154
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:08,226
away, then potential is zero.
Let's now turn to our

155
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:11,764
Vandegraaff.
It's a hollow sphere,

156
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:16,053
has a radius R.
About thirty centimeters.

157
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:22,04
And I'm going to put on here
plus ten microcoulombs.

158
00:11:22,04 --> 00:11:24,461
It will distribute itself
uniformly.

159
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:27,227
We will discuss that next time
in detail.

160
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:30,685
Because it's a conductor.
We already discussed last

161
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:34,627
lecture that the electric field
inside the sphere is zero.

162
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,639
And that the electric field
outside is not zero but that we

163
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,235
can think of all the charge
being at this point here,

164
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:46,385
the plus ten microcoulombs is
all here, as long as we want to

165
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:50,258
know what the electric field
outside is.

166
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:54,892
So you can forget the fact that
it is a -- a sphere.

167
00:11:54,892 --> 00:12:00,526
And so now I want to know what
the electric potential is at any

168
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:04,616
point in space.
I want to know what it is here

169
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:09,978
and I want to know what it is
here at point P which is now a

170
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:15,067
distance R from the center.
And I want to know what it is

171
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,338
here.
At a distance little R from the

172
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,791
center.
So let's first do the potential

173
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:26,153
here.
The potential at point P is

174
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:33,724
an integral going from R to
infinity if I take the electric

175
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:41,034
force divided by my test charge
Q dot DR, but this is the

176
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:46,908
electric field,
see, this force times distance

177
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:55,262
is work, but it is work per unit
charge, so I take my test charge

178
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:59,82
out.
And so this is the integral in

179
00:12:59,82 --> 00:13:03,444
R to infinity of E dot DL -- DR,
sorry.

180
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:06,4
And that's a very easy
integral.

181
00:13:06,4 --> 00:13:11,836
Because we know what E is.
The electric field we have done

182
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,46
several times.
Follows immediately from

183
00:13:15,46 --> 00:13:21,183
Coulomb's law and so when you
calculate this integral you get

184
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:26,428
Q divided by four pi epsilon
zero R which is no surprise

185
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:31,482
because we already had that for
a point

186
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:35,209
charge.
So this is the situation if R,

187
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:38,634
little R, is larger than
capital R.

188
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:44,274
Precisely what we had before.
We can put in some numbers.

189
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:49,411
If you put in R equals R,
which is uh oh point three

190
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:54,347
meters, and you put in here the
ten microcoulombs,

191
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:59,887
and here the -- the thirty
centimeters, then you'll find

192
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,653
three hundred
thousand volts.

193
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:07,096
So you get three times ten to
the fifth volts.

194
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,38
If you um take R equals sixty
centimeters, you double it,

195
00:14:11,38 --> 00:14:15,587
if you double the distance,
the potential goes down by a

196
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,882
factor of two,
it's one over R,

197
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:21,249
so it would be a hundred and
fifty kilovolts.

198
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:25,762
And if you go to three meters,
then it is ten times smaller,

199
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:30,276
then it is thirty kilovolts.
And if you go to infinity which

200
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:34,178
for all practical purposes would
be

201
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:38,373
Lobby seven,
if you go to Lobby seven,

202
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:44,382
then the potential for all
practical purposes is about

203
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:47,897
zero.
Because R is so large that

204
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:52,545
there is no potential left.
So if I, if I,

205
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:57,081
Walter Lewin,
march from infinity to this

206
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:03,09
surface of the Vandegraaff,
and I put a charge Q in my

207
00:15:03,09 --> 00:15:07,771
pocket,
and I march to the Vandegraaff,

208
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:11,507
by the time I reach that point,
I have done work,

209
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:15,165
I multiply the charge now back
to the potential,

210
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:19,836
that gives you the work again,
because potential was work per

211
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,195
unit charge, and so the work
that I have done then is the

212
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:28,165
charge that I have in my pocket
times the potential,

213
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:31,667
in this case the potential of
the Vandegraaff.

214
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:35,559
If I go all the way to this
surface,

215
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,164
which is three hundred thousand
volts.

216
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:42,106
If I were a strong man then I
would put one coulomb in my

217
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,218
pocket.
That's a lot of charge.

218
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:48,442
Then I would have done three
hundred thousand joules of work.

219
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:52,313
By just carrying the one
coulomb from Lobby seven to the

220
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:55,129
Vandegraaff.
That's about the same work I

221
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:58,508
have to do to climb up the
Empire State Building.

222
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:01,324
The famous MGH,
my mass times G times the

223
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:05,759
height that I have to climb.
So I know how the

224
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,11
electric potential goes with
distance.

225
00:16:09,11 --> 00:16:14,183
It's a one over R relationship.
Now I have arrived at the

226
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:18,984
Vandegraaff, I am at the
surface, with my test charge,

227
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:23,15
and now I go inside.
And I slosh around inside,

228
00:16:23,15 --> 00:16:27,68
I feel no force anymore.
There is no electric field

229
00:16:27,68 --> 00:16:30,759
inside.
So as I move around inside,

230
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,926
I experience no force.
That means I do no work.

231
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:39,183
So that means that the
potential

232
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:43,59
must remain constant.
So the absence of an electric

233
00:16:43,59 --> 00:16:48,791
field here implies that the
electric potential everywhere is

234
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:53,374
exactly the same inside is the
same as on the sphere.

235
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:58,486
Because no further work is
needed in marching around with a

236
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:02,188
test charge.
And so for this special case I

237
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:07,123
could make a graph of the
electric potential versus R and

238
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:12,324
this is then the radius of the
Vandegraaff and

239
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:18,513
that would be a constant all
the way up to this point and

240
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:23,045
then it would fall off as one
over R here.

241
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:29,566
And in for the numbers that we
have chosen, the potential at

242
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:35,535
the maximum here would be three
hundred thousand volts.

243
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:42,167
Just as when you look at maps
where you see contours of equal

244
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:47,154
height of
mountains, which we call equal

245
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:51,689
altitudes, here we have surfaces
of equipotential.

246
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:57,149
And if you had a point charge
or if you had the Vandegraaff,

247
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:01,036
these surfaces would be
concentric spheres.

248
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:05,571
The further out you go,
if the charge is positive,

249
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:08,533
the lower the potential would
be.

250
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:12,142
They would be nicely spherical
surfaces.

251
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:17,147
Suppose now we had more
than one charge,

252
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:22,185
we had a plus Q one charge,
and we had a minus Q two

253
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:27,321
charge, for instance.
And you're being asked now what

254
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:32,26
is the potential at point P.
Well, now the electric

255
00:18:32,26 --> 00:18:37,199
potential at point P,
VP, is the potential that you

256
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:42,039
would have measured if Q one had
been there alone.

257
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:47,175
And you have to add the
potential that you would have

258
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:51,517
seen if Q two
had been there alone.

259
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:55,742
Just adding work per unit
charge for one with work per

260
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:59,648
unit charge of the other.
And if this is negative,

261
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:03,793
then this quantity is negative,
and this is positive.

262
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:08,815
So when you have configurations
of positive and negative charges

263
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:12,96
then of course depending upon
where you are in space,

264
00:19:12,96 --> 00:19:17,584
if you're close to the plus
charge, the potential is almost

265
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:22,367
certainly positive,
because the one over R is huge.

266
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:26,255
If you're very close to the
negative charge again the one

267
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:30,282
over R of this little charge
will dominate and so you get a

268
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:33,476
negative potential.
And so you have surfaces of

269
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:37,364
positive potential and you have
equipotential surfaces of

270
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:41,53
negative potentials and so there
are surfaces which have zero

271
00:19:41,53 --> 00:19:44,098
potential.
And they're not always very

272
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,362
easy to envision.
But what I want to show you is

273
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:51,041
some work that Maxwell himself
did in

274
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,631
figuring out these
equipotentials.

275
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:57,556
And so I have here a
transparency of publication by

276
00:19:57,556 --> 00:19:59,518
Maxwell.
You see a charge,

277
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:02,735
let's assume it is plus four
and plus one,

278
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:06,895
it could be minus four and
minus one, but let's assume

279
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:10,113
they're plus.
And you see the green lines,

280
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:14,194
which we have seen before,
which are the field lines.

281
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:18,275
Don't pay any attention to the
green field lines now.

282
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,786
The red lines are
equipotentials.

283
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,867
And you have to rotate them
about

284
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:27,42
the vertical,
because they're of course

285
00:20:27,42 --> 00:20:29,772
surfaces, this is
three-dimensional.

286
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:33,332
I have not drawn all the
equipotential surfaces in red

287
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,885
because they become too
cluttered here.

288
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:38,639
But I've tried to put most of
them in red.

289
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:42,469
Since this charge is positive
and that charge is positive,

290
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:45,425
everywhere in space,
no matter where you are,

291
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:47,574
the potential has to be
positive.

292
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:51,202
There is not a single point
where it could be negative.

293
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:56,577
If you are very far away from
the plus four and the plus one,

294
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:59,946
then you expect that the
equipotential surfaces are

295
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:03,989
spheres, because it's almost as
if you were looking at a plus

296
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:06,887
five charge.
So it doesn't surprise you that

297
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:10,93
when you go far out that you
ultimately get spherical shapes.

298
00:21:10,93 --> 00:21:14,636
When you're very close to the
plus four they are perfect

299
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:17,803
spheres, when you're very close
to the plus one,

300
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:21,577
they are perfect spheres.
But then when you're sort of in

301
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:26,631
between, neither close to the
plus four nor to the plus one,

302
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:29,235
they have this very funny
shape.

303
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:33,605
It reminds me the shape of this
balloon a little bit.

304
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:35,789
Sort of like this.
You see.

305
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:40,747
And there is one surface which
is most unusual equipotential

306
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:45,537
surface which here has a point
where the electric field is

307
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,478
zero.
It's sort of like twisting the

308
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:52,175
neck of a goose,
you get something like this,

309
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:57,384
and so you have here a surface
which has a point here and it is

310
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:02,215
exactly at that point
where the electric field is

311
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:05,309
zero, that does not mean that
the potential is zero,

312
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,038
of course not,
the potential is positive here.

313
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:11,556
If you come with a positive
charge from the Lobby seven and

314
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:15,074
you have to march up to that
point, you have to do positive

315
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:17,137
work.
You have to overcome both the

316
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:20,594
repelling force from the plus
four and the repelling force

317
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,566
from the plus one.
But finally when you reach that

318
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:27,084
point you can rest because there
is no force on you at that

319
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,207
point.
That's what it means that the

320
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:33,552
electric field is zero.
It does not mean that you

321
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,818
haven't done any work.
So never confuse electric

322
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:40,431
fields with potentials.
I want to draw your attention

323
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:43,835
to the fact that the green
lines, the field lines,

324
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:47,309
are everywhere perpendicular to
the equipotentials.

325
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,505
I will get back to that during
my next lecture.

326
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:53,84
That is not an accident.
That is always the case.

327
00:22:53,84 --> 00:22:57,453
Now, Maxwell shows you
something that is a little bit

328
00:22:57,453 --> 00:23:00,719
more complicated.
Here, he calculated for us the

329
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:05,736
equipotential surfaces,
the red ones are the surfaces,

330
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:09,929
again you have to rotate them
about the vertical to make it

331
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:13,183
three-dimensional,
and now we have a minus one

332
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,725
charge and a plus four.
And so whenever it is red,

333
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:19,472
the surface,
the potential is positive,

334
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:23,81
and whenever I have drawn it
blue, the potential is negative.

335
00:23:23,81 --> 00:23:28,292
First, if we were very far away
from both the plus four and the

336
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:32,269
minus one, you expect to be
looking at a charge which is

337
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:36,1
effectively plus three.
And so if you go very far away

338
00:23:36,1 --> 00:23:39,278
for
sure the potential is

339
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,544
everywhere positive and you
expect them to be spherical

340
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:46,23
again.
If you look here you're very

341
00:23:46,23 --> 00:23:49,785
far away from the plus four and
the minus one,

342
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:53,34
indeed this has already the
shape of a sphere.

343
00:23:53,34 --> 00:23:58,08
So that's clear that the plus
four and the minus one far away

344
00:23:58,08 --> 00:24:02,188
behave like a plus three.
If you're very close to the

345
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:06,296
plus four, you get nice spheres
around the plus four,

346
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:10,96
positive potential,
if you're very close to the

347
00:24:10,96 --> 00:24:14,827
minus one, notice that the blue
surfaces are almost nice

348
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:18,765
spheres, but now they're all
negative because you're very

349
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:22,07
close to the minus one.
So a negative potential.

350
00:24:22,07 --> 00:24:25,867
There is here one surface which
now has zero potential.

351
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:30,156
It has to be because if you're
negative potential close to the

352
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:33,954
minus one and you have positive
potential very far out,

353
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:37,258
you got to go through a surface
where it's zero.

354
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:42,603
And so there is here a surface,
I still have put it in blue,

355
00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:47,118
which is actually everywhere on
this surface the potential is

356
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,45
zero.
Is the electric field zero

357
00:24:49,45 --> 00:24:51,031
there?
Absolutely not.

358
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,944
Electric field should not be
confused with potential.

359
00:24:54,944 --> 00:24:59,007
What it means is that if you
take a test charge in your

360
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:02,996
pocket and you come from
infinity and you walk to that

361
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:07,134
surface, that by the time you
have reached that surface,

362
00:25:07,134 --> 00:25:10,37
you've done zero work.
That's what it means.

363
00:25:10,37 --> 00:25:13,51
That the
potential is zero.

364
00:25:13,51 --> 00:25:17,357
There is here one point which
we discussed earlier in my

365
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:20,225
lectures where the electric
field is zero.

366
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,393
The potential is not zero
there.

367
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:25,26
The potential is definitely
positive here.

368
00:25:25,26 --> 00:25:27,568
Because here was the zero
surface.

369
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:31,415
Here is already positive
surface, and this is a positive

370
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:34,003
surface.
So the potential is positive.

371
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:37,919
However, if you reach that
point there's no force on your

372
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,577
charge.
So that means electric field is

373
00:25:40,577 --> 00:25:44,779
zero.
And it's not so easy of course

374
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:49,359
to calculate these surfaces.
Maxwell was capable of doing

375
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,939
that a hundred ten years ago.
And nowadays we can do that

376
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:58,437
very easily with computers.
Equipotential surfaces which

377
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:01,79
have different values can never
intersect.

378
00:26:01,79 --> 00:26:06,125
Plus five volt surface can
never intersect with a plus

379
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:10,133
three or a minus one.
And you think about why that

380
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,359
is.
Why that is,

381
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:17,09
that would be a total
violation of the conservation

382
00:26:17,09 --> 00:26:20,448
of energy.
So equipotential surfaces,

383
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:23,9
different values,
can never intersect.

384
00:26:23,9 --> 00:26:27,351
All right.
So you've seen that for the

385
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:33,041
various charge configurations,
the equipotential surfaces have

386
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:38,544
very complicated shapes and
cannot always be calculated in a

387
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:42,555
very easy way.
Now comes the question why do

388
00:26:42,555 --> 00:26:46,939
we introduce electric
potentials,

389
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,653
who needs them?
And who needs equipotential

390
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:52,109
surfaces?
Isn't it true that if we know

391
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:55,664
the electric field vectors
everywhere in space that that

392
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:59,477
determines uniquely how charges
will move, what acceleration

393
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:02,385
they will obtain,
that means how their kinetic

394
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:05,1
energy will change,
and the answer is yeah,

395
00:27:05,1 --> 00:27:08,655
if you know the electric field
everywhere in space sure.

396
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:12,533
Then you can predict everything
that happens with a charge in

397
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:16,217
that field.
But there are examples where

398
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:20,528
the electric fields are so
incredibly complicated that it

399
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:24,223
is easier to work with
equipotentials because the

400
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:28,842
change in kinetic energy as I
will discuss now really depends

401
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:33,077
only on the change in the
potential when you go from one

402
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:36,541
point to another.
So you will see very shortly

403
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:41,16
that sometimes if you're only
interested in change of kinetic

404
00:27:41,16 --> 00:27:45,625
energy and not necessarily
interested in the details of the

405
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:50,167
trajectory, then equipotentials
come in very

406
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:53,708
handy.
Never confuse U which is

407
00:27:53,708 --> 00:28:00,08
electrostatic potential energy
with V which is electric

408
00:28:00,08 --> 00:28:03,738
potential.
This has unit joules.

409
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:10,582
And this has unit joules per
coulombs, which we call volts.

410
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:16,836
If I have a collection of
charges, pluses and minuses,

411
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:22,465
U has only one value.
It is the work that I have to

412
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:26,043
do to put all these crazy
charges exactly where they are.

413
00:28:26,043 --> 00:28:29,813
But the electric potential is
different here from there from

414
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:31,857
there to there to there to
there.

415
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:35,818
If you're very close to a plus
charge, you can be sure that the

416
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:39,14
potential is positive.
If you're very close to a -- a

417
00:28:39,14 --> 00:28:41,696
negative charge,
you can be sure that the

418
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:44,763
potential is negative.
But U has only one number.

419
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:47,382
It's only one value.
They're both scalars.

420
00:28:47,382 --> 00:28:49,426
Don't confuse one with the
other.

421
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:55
In a gravitational field,
matter, like a piece of chalk,

422
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59,317
wants to go from high potential
to low potential.

423
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:03,903
If I just release it with zero
speed, there it goes,

424
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:06,691
high potential to low
potential.

425
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:11,368
In analogy, positive charges
will also go from a high

426
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:15,505
electric potential to a low
electric potential.

427
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:19,462
And of course this is unique
for electricity,

428
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:25,128
negative charges will go from a
low potential to a high electric

429
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:28,636
potential.
Suppose I had a position A in

430
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:35,527
space
and I had another position B

431
00:29:35,527 --> 00:29:43,622
and I specify the potentials.
So here we have A,

432
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:51,545
potential is VA,
and here we have point B where

433
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:57,401
the potential is VB.
By definition,

434
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:04,943
the potential
of VA as we discussed before is

435
00:30:04,943 --> 00:30:12,036
the integral -- by the way if
these are separated by some

436
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:16,595
random distance R,
whatever you want.

437
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:23,307
So the potential of A is
defined as the integral going

438
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:30,905
from A to infinity of E dot DR.
That is the definition of the

439
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:37,327
potential of A.
There is an E here which is

440
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:42,149
force per unit charge.
So it is not work.

441
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:49,744
If there were force DR it would
be work but it is force per unit

442
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:55,531
charge that makes it E.
So the potential of B for

443
00:30:55,531 --> 00:31:02,403
definition is the integral from
B to infinity of E dot DR.

444
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:10,832
And so therefore the potential
difference between point A and

445
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:16,362
B, VA minus VB,
equals the integral from A to B

446
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:23,214
of E dot DR, and for reasons
that I still don't understand

447
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:29,225
after having been in this
business for a long time,

448
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:37,519
books will always tell you they
reverse VA and B so they give

449
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,399
you VB, VB minus VA.
And then they say well we have

450
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,986
to put a minus sign in front of
the uh integral.

451
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:51,866
It's the same thing.
So books always give it to you

452
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:55,77
in this form.
But it is exactly the same.

453
00:31:55,77 --> 00:32:00,845
Hope you realize that.
This is the two equations that

454
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:05,92
I have here are the same.
VA minus VB is the integral

455
00:32:05,92 --> 00:32:12,044
from A to B of E dot DR.
If I flip this over then all I

456
00:32:12,044 --> 00:32:17,154
have to do is put a minus sign
here and the two are identical.

457
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:21,845
Notice that if there is no
electric field between A and B

458
00:32:21,845 --> 00:32:25,112
they have the same potential,
of course.

459
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:29,719
Because when you march from A
to B with a charge in your

460
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:33,99
pocket no work is done.
So the potential remains the

461
00:32:33,99 --> 00:32:36,587
same.
I will change this DR to a

462
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,351
different symbol,
which I call DL.

463
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:43,539
DR would mean that we go from A
to

464
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:49,628
infinity along this straight
line and then we go from B to

465
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:56,251
infinity along the straight line
but it makes no difference how

466
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:59,776
you go.
If you go from A to B this

467
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:06,399
potential difference and you go
in this way then VA minus VB is

468
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,74
not going to change.
And so if now I introduce here

469
00:33:11,74 --> 00:33:16,7
a element DL,
which is a small vector,

470
00:33:16,7 --> 00:33:22,79
and if the local E vector here
is like so, at this point here,

471
00:33:22,79 --> 00:33:27,681
then VA minus VB is then the
integral of E dot DL.

472
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:33,672
In other words I can replace
the R by an L and you may choose

473
00:33:33,672 --> 00:33:39,262
any path that you prefer.
And that's the way that we will

474
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:43,156
show you this equation most of
the time.

475
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:47,648
So it makes no difference how
you

476
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:53,354
march because we are dealing
here with conservative fields.

477
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:58,469
So let's now make the
assumption that VA is a hundred

478
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:02,305
fifty volts.
And that VB for instance is

479
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:05,748
fifty volts.
So it's a very specific

480
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:08,699
example.
What does it mean now?

481
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:14,502
It means that if I put plus Q
charge in my pocket and I come

482
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:21,092
all the way from Lobby seven and
I walk up to point B.

483
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:27,768
So Walter Lewin plus Q charge
in his pocket goes from Lobby

484
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:33,178
seven to point B,
I have to do work and the work

485
00:34:33,178 --> 00:34:40,199
I have to do is the product of
my charge Q with the potential.

486
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:45,724
So that is Q the work I have to
do is Q times VB.

487
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:52,399
So in this case it's fifty
times Q, whatever that charge is

488
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,119
that I have in my pocket.
This

489
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,494
is in joules.
Now, I go from Lobby seven to

490
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:04,723
point A.
I have to do more work.

491
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:09,411
I have to do a hundred fifty Q
joules of work.

492
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:13,786
You can think of it I first
come to A to B,

493
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:19,099
I'm already exhausted,
I have to put in another work

494
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:25,141
to get all the way to point A.
So you can imagine if I have

495
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:31,927
this plus Q charge at point A,
where there it's it's a higher

496
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:35,693
potential, it wants to go back
all by itself to B.

497
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:40,229
It wants to go from a higher
potential to a lower potential.

498
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:43,226
Look, the E vector is in this
direction.

499
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:46,609
Positive charge will go to a
lower potential.

500
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:50,145
And as it moves from A to B
energy is released.

501
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:53,45
How much energy?
Well, this is the amount of

502
00:35:53,45 --> 00:35:57,832
work I have done to get to A,
this is the amount of work I

503
00:35:57,832 --> 00:36:03,787
did to get to B,
and so if now the charge goes

504
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:08,729
back from A to B,
it's the difference that

505
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:14,032
becomes available in terms of
kinetic energy.

506
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:18,01
It's a change in potential
energy.

507
00:36:18,01 --> 00:36:24,277
And that change in potential
energy, so the change in

508
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:29,58
potential energy,
when the plus Q charge goes

509
00:36:29,58 --> 00:36:35,245
from A to B, that change is Q
times VA minus VB.

510
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:40,341
QVB at point B and QVA
at point A.

511
00:36:40,341 --> 00:36:44,538
So this is the potential energy
that is in principle available

512
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:48,804
if the charge moves from A to B.
And you remember from eight oh

513
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:52,656
one the work energy theorem.
If we deal with conservative

514
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:56,165
forces, then the sum of
potential energy and kinetic

515
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:59,743
energy of an object is the same.
That's also true for

516
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:02,22
gravitational forces.
In other words,

517
00:37:02,22 --> 00:37:06,141
this difference in potential
energy that becomes available

518
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:10,2
like potential energy becomes
available when I drop my chalk

519
00:37:10,2 --> 00:37:14,488
from a high
potential to a low potential,

520
00:37:14,488 --> 00:37:17,176
that's converted to kinetic
energy.

521
00:37:17,176 --> 00:37:22,078
So this difference now is also
converted into kinetic energy of

522
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:25,478
that moving charge.
And so that would be the

523
00:37:25,478 --> 00:37:30,3
kinetic energy at point B minus
the kinetic energy at point A.

524
00:37:30,3 --> 00:37:33,384
Which is really the work energy
theorem.

525
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,835
It's the conservation of
energy.

526
00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:40,025
Now any piece of metal,
no matter how crumby or dented

527
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:45,223
it is, is an equipotential.
As long as there is no charge

528
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:48,635
moving inside the metal.
And that's obvious that it's an

529
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:51,24
equipotential.
Because these charges inside

530
00:37:51,24 --> 00:37:54,341
the metal, these electrons,
when they experience an

531
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,132
electric field,
they begin to move immediately

532
00:37:57,132 --> 00:38:00,357
in the electric field,
and they will move until there

533
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:03,583
is no force on them anymore,
and that means they have

534
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:06,064
effectively made the electric
field zero.

535
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:09,723
So charges inside the conductor
always move automatically in

536
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:13,197
such a way that they kill the
electric

537
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:16,33
field inside.
If the electric field hadn't

538
00:38:16,33 --> 00:38:19,464
been zero yet,
they would still be moving.

539
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:23,821
And so each metal that you
have, no matter where you bring

540
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:27,795
it, as long as there are no
electric currents inside,

541
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:30,165
will always be an
equipotential.

542
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:34,751
So I can take a trash can and
bring it into an external field

543
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:39,49
and then very shortly after I've
brought it in when things have

544
00:38:39,49 --> 00:38:43,465
calmed down, the trash can will
be an

545
00:38:43,465 --> 00:38:48,403
equipotential and the electric
field inside the metal will

546
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:51,348
everywhere will everywhere be
zero.

547
00:38:51,348 --> 00:38:55,939
So I could for instance attach
point A to a trash can,

548
00:38:55,939 --> 00:39:00,011
metal trash can,
so the whole trash can would be

549
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:04,256
at a hundred fifty volts,
and I could put point B,

550
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:08,934
make it part of my -- of my
soda, which is also made of

551
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:12,053
metal.
And so the whole soda would be

552
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:16,65
at fifty
volts and the entire trash can

553
00:39:16,65 --> 00:39:19,514
would be at a hundred fifty
volts.

554
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:24,115
I place the whole thing in
vacuum and now I release an

555
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:26,893
electron at point B.
An electron.

556
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:30,626
An electron wants to go to
higher potential.

557
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:35,835
A proton would go from A to B,
electron wants to go from B to

558
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:38,699
A.
And so now energy is available.

559
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:43,734
The electric potential energy
is available and the electron

560
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:47,35
will
start to pick up speed and

561
00:39:47,35 --> 00:39:50,966
finally end up at A.
Now how it will travel I don't

562
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:52,629
know.
The electric field

563
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:55,449
configuration is enormously
complicated.

564
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:57,907
Between the can and this trash
can.

565
00:39:57,907 --> 00:40:01,522
Amazingly complicated.
If you were to see the field

566
00:40:01,522 --> 00:40:05,354
lines it would be weird.
But if we all we want to know

567
00:40:05,354 --> 00:40:08,825
is what the kinetic energy is,
what the speed is,

568
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:11,717
with which this electron
reaches the can,

569
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:15,405
so what?
Then we can use the work

570
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:19,887
energy theorem and find out
immediately what that kinetic

571
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:23,17
energy is.
Because the available potential

572
00:40:23,17 --> 00:40:27,573
energy is the charge of the
electron times the potential

573
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:30,454
difference between these two
objects.

574
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:35,258
Well the charge of the electron
is one point six times ten to

575
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:39,821
the minus nineteen coulombs.
The potential difference is a

576
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:43,263
hundred volts.
And that is the difference in

577
00:40:43,263 --> 00:40:47,611
kinetic energy.
If I assume that I release the

578
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,855
electron at zero speed,
then I have immediately the

579
00:40:50,855 --> 00:40:54,683
kinetic energy that it has at
point A which is one-half M of

580
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:57,344
the electron times the speed at
A squared.

581
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,847
So now you see that accepting
the fact that we know the

582
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:03,702
equipotentials,
we can very quickly calculate

583
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:07,466
the kinetic energy and therefore
the speed of the electron,

584
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:10,58
as they arrive at A,
without any knowledge of the

585
00:41:10,58 --> 00:41:14,213
complicated electric field.
If you put in the numbers for

586
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:19,698
the mass of the electron,
then, which is nine times ten

587
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:24,808
to the minus thirty-one
kilograms, then you'll find that

588
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:29,732
this speed is about two percent
of the speed of light.

589
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:33,356
A substantial speed.
All our potentials,

590
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:37,351
electric potentials,
are defined relative to

591
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:41,067
infinity.
That means at infinity they are

592
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:44,412
zero.
That is because of the one over

593
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:49,214
R relationship.
That's very nice and dandy and

594
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:51,884
it works.
However, there are situations

595
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:56,169
whereby it really doesn't matter
where you think of your zero.

596
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:59,541
Remember with gravity we had a
similar situation.

597
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:03,686
With gravity we always worried
about difference in potential

598
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:07,34
energy but sometimes we call
this zero and this plus.

599
00:42:07,34 --> 00:42:10,361
Sometimes you call this plus
and this minus.

600
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,084
It doesn't really matter
because the change in kinetic

601
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:18,088
energy is dictated only by the
difference

602
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:21,182
in potentials.
So it is very nice and dandy to

603
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:25,581
call that a hundred fifty and to
call that fifty but you wouldn't

604
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:29,775
have found any different answer
for the electron if you called

605
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:34,105
this potential one hundred volts
and you called this one zero or

606
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:38,024
you called this one zero and
this one minus one hundred or

607
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:41,461
you called this one fifty and
this one minus fifty.

608
00:42:41,461 --> 00:42:45,035
So the behavior of the
electrons of the charges would

609
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:49,228
of course not change.
And of course electrical

610
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:53,986
engineers would always per
definition call the potential of

611
00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:57,677
the earth zero when they built
their circuits.

612
00:42:57,677 --> 00:43:01,696
So now I would like to
demonstrate to you with the

613
00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:06,535
Vandegraaff that if you get a
strong electric field from the

614
00:43:06,535 --> 00:43:11,211
radially outwards from the
Vandegraaff that you get a huge

615
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:15,968
potential difference between
this point here and this point

616
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,839
there.
Uh if I have my numbers still

617
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,399
there,
I hope I do,

618
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,912
there they are,
at the surface of the

619
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:27,193
Vandegraaff which takes about
ten microcoulombs,

620
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:30,683
it will be three hundred
thousand volts right here,

621
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:33,964
here it would be a hundred
fifty thousand volts,

622
00:43:33,964 --> 00:43:37,803
and here three meters from the
center, it's about thirty

623
00:43:37,803 --> 00:43:40,526
kilovolts.
So that means that if I place

624
00:43:40,526 --> 00:43:44,854
this fluorescent tube into that
electric field that there would

625
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:48,344
be a gigantic potential
difference between here and

626
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:50,997
there provided that I hold it
radially.

627
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:56,101
If I hold it like this
then the potential difference

628
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:59,548
between here and there would be
zero of course,

629
00:43:59,548 --> 00:44:03,743
if I hold it tangentially,
they would be both at the same

630
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:07,34
electric potential.
But when I hold them radially

631
00:44:07,34 --> 00:44:11,685
you will see perhaps that this
fluorescent tube will show a

632
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:15,206
little bit of light.
Once you see light it means

633
00:44:15,206 --> 00:44:18,353
that electrons are moving
through that gas.

634
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:22,399
It means charge is moving.
We haven't discussed current

635
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,798
yet,
but that's what it means.

636
00:44:25,798 --> 00:44:29,371
A current is flowing.
And this current has to be

637
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:34,161
delivered by the Vandegraaff and
the Vandegraaff is only capable

638
00:44:34,161 --> 00:44:36,669
of providing very modest
currents.

639
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:39,786
So you're not going to see a
lot of light.

640
00:44:39,786 --> 00:44:43,663
But I want to show you that you
will see some light.

641
00:44:43,663 --> 00:44:45,792
No wires attached.
Just here.

642
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:50,125
And then I will rotate it
tangentially and you will see no

643
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:53,318
light at all.
So if we can make it a little

644
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:57,423
darker as a start and I'll start
the

645
00:44:57,423 --> 00:45:02,565
Vandegraaff and then if Marcos
comes to make it completely dark

646
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:06,296
when necessary,
because the light is so little

647
00:45:06,296 --> 00:45:10,111
that we really have to make it
completely dark.

648
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:14,755
I will put on a glove for
safety reasons although I don't

649
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:19,647
think it will do me much good.
Notice I have here a piece of

650
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:23,213
glass to well,
to be well-insulated from the

651
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:27,027
glass so that I don't mess up
the

652
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:32,08
demonstration by if I hold my
fingers here it will be very

653
00:45:32,08 --> 00:45:35,27
different than holding my hands
here.

654
00:45:35,27 --> 00:45:40,766
So let's go first close without
-- with the lights still on and

655
00:45:40,766 --> 00:45:46,172
then OK why don't you turn the
lights off now all the way off.

656
00:45:46,172 --> 00:45:49,186
OK I -- I think you can see a
glow.

657
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:53,794
It's radially outwards now.
And Marcos can you give a

658
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:57,428
little light?
OK I will now go tangential,

659
00:45:57,428 --> 00:46:03,761
can you turn uh the lights off?
And now you see nothing,

660
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,333
very little.
And now I go radial again.

661
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:11,281
And there you go.
Now if I -- if I'm crazy,

662
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:15,511
if I were crazy,
then I would touch the end of

663
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:21,057
this tube with my finger thereby
allowing this current to go

664
00:46:21,057 --> 00:46:26,603
straight through my body to the
earth which may increase the

665
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:28,671
light.
Let me try that.

666
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:33,865
So -- so I'm
going to touch the -- the --

667
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:39,268
the -- this -- this fluorescent
tube on your right side.

668
00:46:39,268 --> 00:46:39,858
Ah.
Ah.

669
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:43,1
Ah.
Every time I -- I touch it ah.

670
00:46:43,1 --> 00:46:47,815
But that's not ah.
But you see every time I touch

671
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:53,611
it I make it easier for the
current to flow and you see very

672
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:58,621
clearly that it lights up.
Now I want to do the same

673
00:46:58,621 --> 00:47:05,4
demonstration with a neon flash
tube and the neon flash

674
00:47:05,4 --> 00:47:08,524
tube I will place at the end of
a fishing rod.

675
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:12,62
This neon flash tube we used
during the first lecture when I

676
00:47:12,62 --> 00:47:16,994
was beating up students but I've
learned not to do that anymore.

677
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:20,883
Um this takes um several
kilovolts to get a little bit of

678
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:24,076
light out of it from one side to
the other, oh,

679
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:27,687
that's duck soup for the
Vandegraaff, you know you're

680
00:47:27,687 --> 00:47:30,811
talking about hundreds and
thousands of volts,

681
00:47:30,811 --> 00:47:34,838
and so here I will actually
start spinning it and then when

682
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:42,348
it is radially inwards maybe
you will see light and when it

683
00:47:42,348 --> 00:47:51,264
is tangential you won't see much
light and then if I feel very

684
00:47:51,264 --> 00:47:59,45
good I will do that again.
OK uh so Marcos if you make it

685
00:47:59,45 --> 00:48:06,466
uh dark I'll give it a twist.
OK, radial, radial,

686
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,61
radial,
radial, radial,

687
00:48:10,61 --> 00:48:14,512
radial, radial,
radial, radial,

688
00:48:14,512 --> 00:48:18,805
OK.
Now I ah OK I touched it now I

689
00:48:18,805 --> 00:48:23,488
touch it again.
And I touch it again.

690
00:48:23,488 --> 00:48:26,09
And again.
And again.

691
00:48:26,09 --> 00:48:30,253
Ah.
You see every time I touch it

692
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:35,586
it lights me.
And it gives a nice flash of

693
00:48:35,586 --> 00:48:39,879
light.
So you see here in front of

694
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:46,475
your
eyes without any wires attached

695
00:48:46,475 --> 00:48:53,947
that the potential difference
created by the electric field

696
00:48:53,947 --> 00:49:01,033
that those potential differences
make these lights work.

697
00:49:01,033 --> 49:06
All right, see you Friday.
