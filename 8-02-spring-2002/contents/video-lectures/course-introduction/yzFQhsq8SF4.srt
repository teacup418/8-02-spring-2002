9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,350

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,960
PROFESSOR: Well,
8.02 is, of course,

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,350
largely about electricity
and magnetism.

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,420
And at the heart of
electricity and magnetism

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,360
are the four, the
famous four, equations.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,840
We call them the
Maxwell's equations.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,730
It's quite a difficult
course for students.

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:47,000
And I go out of my way to
also introduce many phenomena

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,470
that they see around them and
make those phenomena connect

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,860
with electricity and magnetism,
for instance, lightning.

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,730
I do an electrocardiogram
in class.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,280
I discuss metal detectors.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,750
I discuss musical instruments,
magnetic levitation.

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,500
I talk about Northern
Lights, which

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,610
is very relevant to
electricity and magnetism.

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,530
I spent almost a whole lecture
on particle accelerators.

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,870
I tell them why the sunsets are
red and why the skies are blue.

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:26,090
I talk about rainbows,
about halos, about glories.

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,400
I talk about color perception.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,240
And since I do
Doppler effect, I also

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,890
talk about Big Bang cosmology.

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,440
And then during my
very last lecture,

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,620
I introduce them to my
research, the research

32
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,800
I did during my early
days at MIT, when

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,300
I was making X-ray observations
from very high-flying balloons,

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,030
altitude of 140,000,
150,000 feet.

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,500
So my goal is,
wherever possible,

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,030
to make them see
through the equations,

37
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,250
to make you see the beauty
all around them, and by doing

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,790
that to make them love physics.

39
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,459
Well, the 8.02 course is the
second course in physics.

40
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,050
It's mandatory.

41
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,390
It's what we call a General
Institute Requirement.

42
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,420
You either have to
take this course,

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,095
or you have to take one which
is a slightly higher level, 8.02

44
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:20,780
II.

45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,270
So it is the basis that students
get during their first year.

46
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,950
8.01, the Newtonian
mechanics, and then 8.02,

47
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,730
the electricity and magnetism.

48
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,180
And if they go into physics,
of course, they get a lot more.

49
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,340
But if they never
go into physics,

50
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,000
then this is all they will
ever see about physics,

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,340
which is quite a lot actually.

52
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,720
We evaluate the students
through traditional exams.

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,100
The lectures are given in
the main lecture hall of MIT,

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,280
and then the students meet in
smaller groups with professors.

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,610
We call those recitations, which
is largely problem solving.

56
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,630
There are many events
in this course.

57
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,460
Every lecture is an event.

58
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,310
And the students
who have taken me,

59
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,230
they'll tell you that,
indeed, going to my lectures

60
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,520
is an event.

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm not a very
traditional lecturer.

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,670
So therefore, I
would really like

63
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,050
to think that each
lecture is an event.

64
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,350
We do have a contest, which
is very, very popular.

65
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:30,280
We hand to the students a piece
of wood, some copper wire,

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,000
a few paper clips,
and two magnets.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,950
And the goal is to
make an electric motor.

68
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,230
And they get course
credit depending

69
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,870
upon how fast their
motor is going.

70
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,290
And this is really
a real happening.

71
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,600
It's an incredible event.

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,860
And some of the motors are
extraordinary in their design.

73
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,490
If you and I would
try to build a motor,

74
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,580
you'll be lucky if your
motor rotates 400 revolutions

75
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,640
per minute.

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,120
But let me tell
you, some students

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,150
go through the 5,000
revolutions per minute mark.

78
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,650
It's really quite amazing.

79
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,540
And they spent so
much time on that.

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,890
It's a wonderful event.

81
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,590
it's really a happening.

82
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,459
Well, my message
to all educators

83
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,950
is what counts is
not what you cover,

84
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,780
but what counts is
what you uncover.

85
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,060
And this is often forgotten.

86
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,560
So there is a
general tendency, not

87
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,090
everyone, but a general
tendency to ram too much

88
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,120
down the throats of the
students and overlook

89
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,140
that that's very
anti-productive.

90
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,540
Because it goes one ear
in, as we say in Holland,

91
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,400
and it goes the
other ear out again.

92
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
So what you cover
is not what matters.

93
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,570
But what you uncover
is what matters.

94
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,340
And if you can somehow
do it so that there

95
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,260
are parts of the course
that they will remember

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,350
for the rest of their lives,
that's even more important.

97
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,470
If a student has
come to my lectures

98
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,660
on rainbows and
halos and glories,

99
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,560
for the rest of
their lives rainbows

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,490
will never be the same.

101
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,590
And they will always think of
me when they see a rainbow.

102
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,350
And in fact, sometimes 20
or 30 years after a lecture,

103
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,120
they send me still pictures.

104
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,780
And they say, Professor
Lewin, I saw a rainbow,

105
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,320
and I thought of you,
and here is a picture.

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,160
And the interesting
thing is, they sometimes

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,340
send me a picture which is
not even a rainbow, which

108
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:31,970
is a glory.

109
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,810
But that doesn't matter.

110
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,830
What it shows is
that I have succeeded

111
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,500
in making them love
physics, and that's my goal.

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,030
And that should be the
goal of every educator,

113
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,310
to make them love physics.

114
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,628
