1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,746



2
00:00:00,746 --> 00:00:06,418
So we have covered RC circuits
and RL circuits,

3
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:13,694
and today, we will spend the
entire lecture on LRC circuits.

4
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:21,093
We will only discuss them in
series so that you get the basic

5
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:25,039
idea.
I have here a driving power

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,835
supply, alternating,
and here I have a

7
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:34,301
capacitor C,
self-inductor L,

8
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:38,14
and a resistance R,
this is A C,

9
00:00:38,14 --> 00:00:44,702
and that the driving voltage be
V zero cosine omega T.

10
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:51,141
We have to set up the
differential equation for this,

11
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:58,323
and I want to remind you that
Kirchoff's Loop Rule does not

12
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:02,656
hold.
So the closed loop

13
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:06,735
integral of E dot D L,
in spite of what the author of

14
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:10,499
your book wants you to believe,
that is not zero.

15
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:14,734
So how do we set it up?
There are various ways that you

16
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:17,636
can do that, I have my own
discipline.

17
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:22,028
I, in my [unintelligible],
I think of this first being a,

18
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:26,655
a battery -- by this is the
plus side, and this is the minus

19
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:31,047
side -- a current is going to
flow, capacitor is going to

20
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:35,831
charge up, electric field inside
the capacitor

21
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:39,425
is in this direction,
the electric field in the

22
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:43,955
self-inductor is always zero,
because the self-inductor has

23
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:47,002
no resistance.
There's no electric field

24
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:51,064
inside the self-inductor,
no matter what some of your

25
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:55,516
books want you to believe.
Then, the electric field in the

26
00:01:55,516 --> 00:02:00,125
resistor is in this direction,
and the electric field inside

27
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:04,577
the power supply goes from plus
to minus, would be in this

28
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:09,03
direction.
So if I set up the differential

29
00:02:09,03 --> 00:02:12,619
equation, I start here,
I always go in the same

30
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:16,208
direction as I,
because only then is the closed

31
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:20,734
loop integral minus L D I D T.
So I go over this capacitor,

32
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:24,167
that is V of C,
then I go through the wire of

33
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:27,678
the self-inductor.
There is no electric field,

34
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:30,721
so the integral E dot D L there
is zero.

35
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:34,154
Then I go through the resistor,
so I get I R,

36
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,68
and then I have here my power
supply, so I get minus V zero

37
00:02:38,68 --> 00:02:42,095
cosine
omega T, and that,

38
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:47,225
now, according to Faraday's
Law, equals L minus L D I D T.

39
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:52,265
The current equals D Q D T.
If the current is positive --

40
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:58,026
this is my positive direction --
then the charge of the capacitor

41
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:01,806
will increase.
And I also know that V of C,

42
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:07,116
the potential difference over
the capacitor is the charge on

43
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:11,167
each one of the capacitor
plates,

44
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,93
divided by C.
And so I substitute that in

45
00:03:14,93 --> 00:03:19,07
this equation,
and I bring D L D I D T to the

46
00:03:19,07 --> 00:03:22,645
left side.
That is conventionally done.

47
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:27,162
You don't have to do that,
but that's often done.

48
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:31,772
So I get a plus L,
D I D T now becomes D two Q D T

49
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:37,418
squared -- my goal is to get
everything in terms of Q -- then

50
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:44,013
my I R become R times D Q D T,
and my V of C becomes Q divided

51
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:47,466
by C -- notice that I ranked
them in order,

52
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:50,756
D two Q D T squared,
D Q D T, and then Q,

53
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:55,443
you don't have to do that,
but there is nothing wrong with

54
00:03:55,443 --> 00:04:00,459
doing that -- And then we get
here, equals V zero cosine omega

55
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,008
T.
And this is the form in which

56
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:07,202
most books would present this
differential equation.

57
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:13,533
And they arrive that in various
ways, most books arrive at this

58
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:17,419
equation in a completely wrong
way, but they get -- anyhow,

59
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,506
they end up with this equation.
And so, you have to solve this

60
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:25,19
equation, which is really beyond
your present abilities,

61
00:04:25,19 --> 00:04:29,143
it's second-order differential
equation, it's really part of

62
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,823
eighteen oh three,
so I will give you the

63
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,369
solution.
The basic idea being that you

64
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:37,249
find a solution for Q as a
function of time,

65
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:39,996
and once you know Q as a
function of time,

66
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:42,14
you have, of course,
the current,

67
00:04:42,14 --> 00:04:47,158
because then you take
the derivative of your

68
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:50,665
solution, and you get the
current.

69
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:55,872
I will give you the current as
a function of time.

70
00:04:55,872 --> 00:05:00,867
So I, that satisfies that
differential equation,

71
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:06,712
is the V zero divided by
[whistles] R squared plus omega

72
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:12,239
L minus one over omega C
squared, and the whole thing

73
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:21,124
times cosine omega T minus phi.
And the tangent of phi equals

74
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:27,523
omega L minus one over omega C
divided by R.

75
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:34,964
We give this upstairs here a
name, we call that the

76
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:38,535
reactance.
The reactance,

77
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:47,464
and that X, or sometimes it's
called xi, is omega L minus one

78
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:50,649
over omega
C.

79
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:56,686
And the units are also ohms.
We call the entire square root

80
00:05:56,686 --> 00:06:00,953
that you see here,
we call that capital Z,

81
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:07,303
which is called the impedance,
so the square root of R squared

82
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:13,132
plus that X squared equals Z,
that also has units of ohm,

83
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,462
and that is called the
impedance.

84
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:22,083
And so Z is an effective
resistance, because this whole

85
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,26
thing behaves
like a resistance.

86
00:06:26,26 --> 00:06:29,906
But the resistance depends not
only on R L and C,

87
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,26
but also on the values of
omega.

88
00:06:32,26 --> 00:06:36,285
This solution is what we call a
steady-state solution,

89
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:40,994
it is the solution that you get
if you wait a certain amount of

90
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:43,652
time.
If you turn the instrument on,

91
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:46,993
so you all of a sudden start
this experiment,

92
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:50,866
then in the beginning,
you get a different solution,

93
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:54,663
which is more complicated,
you get

94
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:58,38
transient phenomenon,
but these transient phenomenon

95
00:06:58,38 --> 00:07:01,441
die out, and you end up with
this solution.

96
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:05,304
Now, there are several
interesting things that you can

97
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:08,802
see in this solution.
We have to start digesting,

98
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:10,988
this whole hour,
this solution.

99
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,247
It has very interesting
aspects.

100
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:16,308
For one thing,
you can see that the current

101
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:20,681
can be delayed over the driving
voltage when phi is positive.

102
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:24,324
Then the current comes later
than

103
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:26,911
the voltage.
And that's the result of the

104
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:29,304
inductor, we've discussed that
before.

105
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:33,184
But now, that's also possible
that the current is leading the

106
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:36,612
voltage, which is very hard to
understand intuitively.

107
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:40,169
That is the case when this term
dominates over this one,

108
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,402
then phi becomes negative,
and so minus phi becomes

109
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:45,601
positive.
If minus phi is positive,

110
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,8
the current is leading the
voltage.

111
00:07:47,8 --> 00:07:50,387
Now you may say,
"How can it possibly be?

112
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:55,173
Does that meant that before I
switch the instrument on,

113
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:59,898
that I already have a current?
Of course it doesn't mean that.

114
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:03,23
But that's the transient
solution, remember?

115
00:08:03,23 --> 00:08:07,026
When you turn something on,
when you switch it on,

116
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:11,287
this solution doesn't hold yet.
This is the steady-state

117
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:13,766
solution.
So the value for I Max,

118
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:17,949
we have always called what is
front of the cosine term,

119
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,288
we've always called that I Max,
that value for I Max is a

120
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:27,978
function of omega itself --
as we will analyze in detail

121
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:31,632
today -- and of course,
also, of R L and C.

122
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:36,592
And there is one particular
value for Z, and therefore for

123
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:40,333
omega, whereby this value
reaches a maximum,

124
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,204
and that's what we call
resonance.

125
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:48,077
There is no  value for omega
for which the current is any

126
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:50,774
higher.
And so I will call here,

127
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:53,123
the situation,
as resonance.

128
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:57,908
It is at resonance when X
equals

129
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:01,678
zero, so when omega L is one
over omega C,

130
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:06,09
so when omega is one over the
square root of L C.

131
00:09:06,09 --> 00:09:11,606
And we call that the resonance
frequency, and we often give a

132
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:17,397
little subscript zero to remind
you that you're dealing with the

133
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:21,166
resonance frequency.
And Z is then just R,

134
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:25,854
because when X is zero,
the omega L and the one over

135
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:31,691
omega C eat each other up.
They are not there any more,

136
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:34,987
it's gone.
And so the system behaves as if

137
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:39,408
there were only a resistor.
And so you also see that the

138
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:42,946
maximum current that you get is
then, simply,

139
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:46,564
V zero divided by that value
for R, because Z,

140
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,413
the impedance,
is now R.

141
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:51,95
And in addition,
if you're interested in phi,

142
00:09:51,95 --> 00:09:56,131
phi then becomes zero,
so the driving voltage is then

143
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:59,186
in phase with the current that
follows.

144
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:03,447
And so the signal that you will
see

145
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:10,652
is a cosinusoidal variation in
the current, so if I have here

146
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:17,738
the current as a function of
time, and you get a signal like

147
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:23,502
so, and this here,
this period T  equals your two

148
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:29,026
pi divided by omega.
So that is the -- directly

149
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:33,23
connected to your driving
frequency.

150
00:10:33,23 --> 00:10:39,595
And if the impedance Z is very
low,

151
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:43,573
then this maximum value of the
current, this is what we call

152
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:47,282
the maximum vale -- and,
of course, the maximum value is

153
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:50,721
also here, except that the
cosine is minus one here,

154
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:54,362
and the cosine is plus one here
-- so if Z is very low,

155
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,127
then this will be high.
If Z is very high,

156
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:00,229
this will be low.
And there is only one and one

157
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:03,398
value of Z for which the system
is at resonance,

158
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:06,298
and that is when the
self-inductance and the

159
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:11,773
capacitor eat each other up,
and then you get the maximum

160
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:17,176
possible value for the current
at maximum, which is V zero over

161
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,79
R.
And that's the highest value

162
00:11:19,79 --> 00:11:24,671
that you could ever get them.
Imagine that we have an LRC

163
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:29,725
circuit, and we have L and R and
C fixed, but we change the

164
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:33,908
driving frequency.
So we move over various values

165
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:38,963
of Z by changing omega from a
very low value to a very high

166
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:41,752
value.
If you start at a very low

167
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:46,506
value for
omega, let's say it approaches

168
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:51,657
zero, then notice that Z goes to
infinity, and so the maximum

169
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:56,035
current becomes zero.
And the person responsible for

170
00:11:56,035 --> 00:12:00,499
that is the capacitor,
because if omega goes to zero,

171
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:04,276
this goes to infinity.
And that's intuitively

172
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:09,426
pleasing, because omega zero
really means you have no A C any

173
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:13,289
more, you have D C.
And with D C,

174
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,836
what you're doing is,
you charge up the capacitor

175
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,752
when it's fully charged,
no current can flow any more.

176
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:25,185
So that's intuitively pleasing.
When omega becomes very high,

177
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:27,919
let's call it infinity,
then Z, again,

178
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,392
goes to infinity.
So again, the maximum current,

179
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:35,012
again goes to zero.
And the person responsible for

180
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:38,854
that is the self-inductor,
because when omega goes to

181
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:41,44
infinity, again,
Z goes to infinity.

182
00:12:41,44 --> 00:12:44,693
So again,
you get zero here.

183
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:49,056
And that's also intuitively
pleasing, because if you have an

184
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:53,197
infinitely high frequency,
that means the self-inductance

185
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:57,338
puts up an enormous fight.
It's ideal for a self-inductor

186
00:12:57,338 --> 00:13:01,775
to fight currents if the time
over which the changes occur go

187
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,328
to zero.
And so, then,

188
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:06,36
again, it says,
"Sorry, you can't have any

189
00:13:06,36 --> 00:13:09,687
current." So that's also
intuitively pleasing,

190
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:13,459
that the self-inductance,
then, becomes the dominant

191
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,596
factor.
And so what I can do now,

192
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,532
I can plot the I Max as a
function of omega.

193
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:24,736
So here is omega,
and here is I Max,

194
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:28,856
and we already agreed that when
omega is zero,

195
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:33,158
then I Max is zero.
But when omega is very high,

196
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:37,369
it's also zero.
But when omega is at resonance,

197
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:42,953
omega zero, which is one over
the square root of L C -- notice

198
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:48,259
that R has nothing to
do with the resonant frequency,

199
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:52,056
it's really determined by L and
C, because it's the side,

200
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:55,649
it's the X that you want to
make zero, and X is only a

201
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,785
function of L and C -- at this
frequency, we have a value here

202
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:03,649
which is V zero divided by R.
And so the curve that you're

203
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:06,361
going to see,
which we call the resonance

204
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:10,497
curve, is something like this.
You start out with an extremely

205
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:13,141
small current,
you go through resonance,

206
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:16,666
we have a high current,
and then at high frequencies,

207
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,317
again,
you go down to zero.

208
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:25,376
And so the left part,
when you are below resonance,

209
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:31,345
it's really the capacitance
which is the dominant guy in the

210
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:35,594
whole game -- and phi,
by the way, is here,

211
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:41,665
less than zero -- here it is
the  inductor that plays the key

212
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:47,533
role, and here phi equals larger
than zero, and right here,

213
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:50,77
phi, and only there,
phi is zero,

214
00:14:50,77 --> 00:14:56,645
only when you're exactly at
resonance.

215
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:01,022
I'd like to show you some
numerical results,

216
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:06,418
and for that I have a
transparency -- it's also on the

217
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:11,101
web, so you don't have to copy
the numbers, uh,

218
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:17,31
you can download them -- these
are just some numerical numbers

219
00:15:17,31 --> 00:15:23,52
which I want to digest with you,
so that you get a feeling for

220
00:15:23,52 --> 00:15:27,202
the
effect, that you see it in

221
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:30,6
front of your own eyes,
what is happening,

222
00:15:30,6 --> 00:15:34,412
how this curve evolves.
We have here a given R,

223
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:38,141
L, and C, ten,
five times ten to the minus two

224
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:42,45
Henry, and three times ten to
the minus seven farads.

225
00:15:42,45 --> 00:15:46,843
The resonant frequency is a
little over eight thousand

226
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:50,82
radians per second,
you see it here in kiloHertz,

227
00:15:50,82 --> 00:15:55,13
and you see here the impedance
-- and what I do here,

228
00:15:55,13 --> 00:15:59,804
I have a driving
frequency which is ten percent

229
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:03,443
below the resonance frequency.
And I calculate for you,

230
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:06,207
here omega L,
which is three hundred sixty

231
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:10,116
seven ohms, and one over omega
C, which is four fifty three

232
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:12,206
ohms.
You are a little bit below

233
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:15,306
resonance, and so C dominates.
And you can see,

234
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:18,744
indeed, that this ohm value is
larger than this one.

235
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,923
And so out of that pops a value
for X, out of that pops a value

236
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:25,215
for Z.
Notice that X is eighty six,

237
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:29,057
and Z is only a hair larger
than eighty

238
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:31,984
six, because this R almost
doesn't add to Z,

239
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:35,728
because you get here the square
root of ten squared plus

240
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,792
eighty-six squared,
that is almost eighty six.

241
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:42,128
It becomes eighty seven.
And then you see that the

242
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:46,145
current, the maximum current,
which is this value for V zero

243
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:48,732
divided by, uh,
the Z, by eighty seven,

244
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,91
becomes oh point one one
amperes.

245
00:16:50,91 --> 00:16:53,77
And now, the system is driven
at resonance,

246
00:16:53,77 --> 00:16:57,582
and notice that it's exactly
characteristic for resonance

247
00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:01,788
that omega L
and one over omega C have the

248
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,606
same value.
They are not there any more,

249
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,136
they're gone.
And so X becomes zero,

250
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:10,966
so the impedance becomes ohm --
ten ohms, which is the

251
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:15,446
resistance, and so the maximum
current is now V zero divided by

252
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:19,131
R, which is one amperes.
And when you're ten percent

253
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,383
over resonance,
then the self-inductor becomes

254
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:25,924
to be more powerful than the
capacitor, and again,

255
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:29,609
your current is substantially
down,

256
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:34,46
in this, case,
eight times lower than at

257
00:17:34,46 --> 00:17:39,434
resonance.
We define, at a height  of  oh

258
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:47,02
point seven times the value at
resonance, we define a width of

259
00:17:47,02 --> 00:17:51,621
this curve.
And this width is given in

260
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:59,332
terms of delta omega.
And that width --

261
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:04,729
and I will give you the answer
without mathematical proof,

262
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:09,273
it's not so difficult,
but it's a little bit of a

263
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:13,061
headache -- that value is R
divided by L.

264
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:17,038
So the larger R is,
the broader it becomes.

265
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,435
So if we look at delta omega,
for the numbers that we have

266
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:27,642
there, the numbers of the
transparency -- so this is for

267
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:32,944
for the numbers that we have
there,

268
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:38,386
we have delta omega,
would be R, which is ten ohms,

269
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:42,957
divided by five times ten to
the minus two,

270
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:48,181
and that is about two hundred
radians per second.

271
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:54,385
We define Q not as charge --
don't never confuse that with

272
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:59,935
charge -- we call that the
quality of the resonance,

273
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:04,942
and the quality is defined as
omega

274
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:09,736
zero divided by delta omega.
Now, omega zero itself is one

275
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:14,699
over the square root of L C,
and delta omega as R divided by

276
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:17,306
L.
And so that makes the quality

277
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:21,007
one over R times the square root
of L over C.

278
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:24,792
And the quality is the measure
for omega zero,

279
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:28,073
which is this,
what I'm pointing at now,

280
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:31,185
divided by delta omega,
which is this.

281
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:35,979
So if the quality is high,
this peak is relatively narrow,

282
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:39,422
and
if the quality is low,

283
00:19:39,422 --> 00:19:43,022
it's relatively wide.
You may ask yourself the

284
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:48,063
question, why do we define delta
omega at seventy percent of the

285
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,663
maximum current at resonance?
Why not at half?

286
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:55,823
There's a good reason for that,
because, in practice,

287
00:19:55,823 --> 00:20:00,624
we are more interested in power
than that we are in currents.

288
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:03,824
And power is proportional with
I squared.

289
00:20:03,824 --> 00:20:08,785
And so when you square this,
you get point five.

290
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:12,971
And point five means,
then, that this is really the

291
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:17,241
width at half-power.
And so that's the reason why we

292
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:21,595
chose the oh point seven times
the maximum current at

293
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,609
resonance.
It's really the half-power

294
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,539
width.
Resonance can be destructive.

295
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,637
Uh, imagine,
if you have a very high-Q

296
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:33,986
system, if you're slightly
off-resonance,

297
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:38,424
there's almost no current,
no power dissipated in your

298
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:42,192
resistor, and now,
you come,

299
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,316
all of a sudden,
on the resonance,

300
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:47,728
you can an enormous current,
and that means there's an

301
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:50,497
enormous power dissipation in
your resistor,

302
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:52,685
and you can burn out your
resistor.

303
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:56,033
You can destroy your circuits,
if you're not careful.

304
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:59,832
And next lecture -- and Monday,
I will also discuss with you

305
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:03,823
some med- mechanical resonances.
Mechanical systems can also go

306
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:06,72
into [unintelligible] can also
be destructive.

307
00:21:06,72 --> 00:21:10,068
At certain frequencies,
the systems behave -- call it

308
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,901
k- violently,
they respond extremely strongly

309
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:16,061
to
their input frequency,

310
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:19,649
and things can break.
Humans also have resonance

311
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:22,932
frequencies, you can call them,
if you want,

312
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:26,52
emotional resonances.
All have sensitive nerves.

313
00:21:26,52 --> 00:21:30,642
Someone makes a particular
remark, go through the roof.

314
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:34,154
Also, falling in love,
when you think about it,

315
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:37,207
is a resonance phenomenon,
and that, too,

316
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,643
can be rather destructive.
As many of us know.

317
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:44,841
But now I would like to
demonstrate to you the resonance

318
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:49,669
curves --
I'm going to choose particular

319
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:52,066
values of, um,
R, L, and C,

320
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:56,401
which I can change,
and then I will show you the

321
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:59,536
current as a function of
frequency.

322
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:03,501
And these are the values that I
have chosen.

323
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:07,743
Again, this is on the Web,
you can download it,

324
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,694
so you don't have to copy it
now.

325
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:17,979
And I will change the -- the
light setting so that we can

326
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:21,798
also enjoy the demonstration.
The idea being that,

327
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,475
for these values that I have
there, in the first line you see

328
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:29,515
R sixty ohms,
and the self-inductance is

329
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,022
fifty milliHenry,
and the capacitance is point

330
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:36,296
three microfarads.
So that's a given there.

331
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:39,648
And I give you here the
resonance frequency,

332
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:43,077
eight thousand,
in terms of omega radians per

333
00:22:43,077 --> 00:22:47,676
second, this is the resonance
frequency in Hertz -- and just

334
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:52,415
in case you're
interested, I gave you the Q

335
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:56,396
value there as well.
And what I'm going to do now

336
00:22:56,396 --> 00:23:01,539
for you, is I'm going to sweep
the input frequency from zero to

337
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,442
sixteen thousand radians per
second.

338
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:08,423
So my omega can go from zero to
sixteen thousand.

339
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:11,741
And I leave the values as they
are, here.

340
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:16,136
So I'm going to sweep,
sweep over this eight thousand.

341
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:20,45
And so you're going to see that
curve.

342
00:23:20,45 --> 00:23:23,839
Except that I'm show -- I'm
going to show you I as a

343
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,966
function of frequency,
not I Max.

344
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:29,356
And I is oscillating,
because there's a cosine term.

345
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:31,749
And so, for instance,
if I were here,

346
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:35,537
with this value for omega,
you would see then that it goes

347
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:38,329
up, it goes down,
it goes up, it goes down,

348
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:41,453
it goes up, and it goes down.
And when I'm here,

349
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,643
you will see this.
And keep that in mind when you

350
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:48,432
look at the curve that you're
going to see there -- and so

351
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:53,429
it's only the envelope,
then, that is the I Max.

352
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:58,482
But you actually see the entire
current as a function of

353
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,79
frequency.
And I am going to do that,

354
00:24:01,79 --> 00:24:06,384
then, for all these four values
that you see there.

355
00:24:06,384 --> 00:24:11,622
So, let's first change the
light so that we get an optimum

356
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:15,573
situation for you.
And now, I will show you.

357
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:20,81
Already, the results of the
first line -- so these are the

358
00:24:20,81 --> 00:24:25,074
values that you see
there.

359
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:27,885
And I go -- I sl- I go very
slowly.

360
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,944
Now omega is zero here,
omega goes up,

361
00:24:30,944 --> 00:24:34,334
I go through resonance,
and omega is here,

362
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:39,13
the value would be sixteen
thousand radians per second that

363
00:24:39,13 --> 00:24:42,52
we have here.
And it sweeps back and forth

364
00:24:42,52 --> 00:24:45,248
between zero and sixteen
thousand.

365
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:48,803
So you see a dramatic increase
at resonance.

366
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:53,02
So now what I'm going to do,
I'm going to double the

367
00:24:53,02 --> 00:24:57,422
self-inductance.
And when you double the

368
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:59,705
self-inductance,
this one goes up,

369
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:02,887
omega zero goes down.
So all I want you to see,

370
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:06,76
that the resonance frequency,
which is here -- that's the

371
00:25:06,76 --> 00:25:10,219
maximum -- that the resonance
frequency will shift.

372
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,916
Because if L goes up by a
factor of two,

373
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:16,928
the resonant frequency will
come down by the square root of

374
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:19,349
two.
And so I am going to increase L

375
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:23,43
by a factor of two -- let me
make sure that I have the right

376
00:25:23,43 --> 00:25:27,856
know here -- and this is my L.
Notice that the

377
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:31,576
f- the resonant frequency is
now at a lower value,

378
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:34,765
it is here.
Also notice that the peak value

379
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:38,864
at resonance has not changed.
Because the peak value at

380
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:41,977
resonance, you see on the
blackboard here,

381
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:45,621
is V zero over R.
So as long as I don't change R,

382
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:49,264
that doesn't change.
It's only the frequency that

383
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:51,846
changes.
Omega zero is one over the

384
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:54,275
square root of L C.
That changes.

385
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:57,387
It is now here.
So I have increased L by a

386
00:25:57,387 --> 00:26:01,679
factor of two,
I can bring it back to my

387
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,966
original resonance frequency by
now changing C.

388
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:08,967
If you increase by a factor of
two, all you have to do is

389
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,04
decrease C by a factor of two,
and you're back at the same

390
00:26:13,04 --> 00:26:15,898
resonance.
So I'm going to make C down --

391
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:19,256
C lower by a factor of two,
which I'm doing now,

392
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:22,543
and if you look,
now, here, and you have a good

393
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:26,901
memory, you will see that the
resonant frequency is back where

394
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,331
it was.
Again, V zero over R is not

395
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:33,104
changed,
and the resonant frequency is

396
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:36,208
back here, even though L is now
twice is higher,

397
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:39,444
and C is twice lower.
To show you the effect of R,

398
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:42,548
I will double R now,
and I will leave everything

399
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:46,049
else alone, so the resonance
frequency will stay here,

400
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:49,747
but of course the maximum
current -- this high value will

401
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:51,795
now come down,
because, you see,

402
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:54,701
at resonance,
this value is v zero divided by

403
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:57,409
R, and since R goes up by a
factor of two,

404
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,569
you will see that the maximum
current will go

405
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:05,541
down by a factor of two.
And so, I go now from sixty --

406
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,556
from fifty -- oh,
no, I go from sixty to a

407
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:12,822
hundred, I don't double it -- I
can't go any further than a

408
00:27:12,822 --> 00:27:15,47
hundred.
But you'll see a substantial

409
00:27:15,47 --> 00:27:18,411
reduction.
So if you're ready for this --

410
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:22,236
remember this height -- and now
you see hundred ohms,

411
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:25,545
and it is much lower.
It was this high before,

412
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:29,002
and now it's only here.
But notice the resonance

413
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:33,455
frequency has not changed.
So this is an extremely

414
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:35,474
interesting behavior,
and every time,

415
00:27:35,474 --> 00:27:37,887
you have to think through what
is happening,

416
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:40,804
you have not much intuition for
it, you're not alone,

417
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:43,216
I don't have much intuition for
that either.

418
00:27:43,216 --> 00:27:46,526
But with these rather simple
equations -- they're really not

419
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:49,555
that difficult -- here,
this is really the heart of the

420
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:52,192
equation, and then,
of course, your tangent phi,

421
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,39
in case you're interested in
the phase lag -- that they're

422
00:27:55,39 --> 00:27:58,587
really not that difficult.
I will not hold you responsible

423
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:02,009
for being able to derive the r-
solution.

424
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,42
I give you the solution.
But with that solution,

425
00:28:05,42 --> 00:28:08,541
you can do a lot,
and you can understand the

426
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:11,226
behavior of these circuits quite
well.

427
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:13,765
Now I'm going to do a
demonstration,

428
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:16,596
and I warn you,
you have to very closely

429
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,643
follow, step-by-step,
what I'm going to do.

430
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:23,925
Because if you miss one small
step, you're lost for the next

431
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:26,174
twelve minutes.
Completely lost.

432
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:30,528
You will just see nice things,
but you don't know what you're

433
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:34,782
looking at.
So follow me closely.

434
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:39,725
I have an LRC circuit.
And the LRC circuit is right

435
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:41,505
here.
This is my L,

436
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:44,965
oh point one Henry,
these are my Cs,

437
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:49,514
and this is my R,
it's a two-hundred watt light

438
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:52,183
bulb.
I have an LRC circuit.

439
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:56,435
And I will give you the values
fro L, for R,

440
00:28:56,435 --> 00:29:00,389
and for C.
I'm going to drive it at sixty

441
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:04,812
Hertz.
So omega equals three hundred

442
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:07,601
and seventy seven radians per
second.

443
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:11,63
And whatever you're going to
see, for the next twelve

444
00:29:11,63 --> 00:29:14,419
minutes, that is not going to
change.

445
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,836
That frequency is a given.
I simply plug it into the wall,

446
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:23,485
and so my driving voltage is
hundred and ten times the square

447
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:28,289
root of two, times the cosine of
omega T, and it is this omega.

448
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:33,016
So it's the hundred ten volts
that comes out of

449
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:38,932
the wall, so to speak.
My light bulb R is sixty ohms

450
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:43,92
when it is hot,
and it is a two hundred watt

451
00:29:43,92 --> 00:29:46,82
bulb.
So if it's -- bright

452
00:29:46,82 --> 00:29:52,505
two-hundred watt bulb.
The self-inductance L is oh

453
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:57,609
point one Henry,
and the capacitance is eight

454
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:01,437
microfarads.
So this is God-given.

455
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:08,209
With these three values,
I can calculate what Z is,

456
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:13,36
and Z is three hundred ohms.
In case you're interested,

457
00:30:13,36 --> 00:30:18,51
I can also give you omega L,
that is thirty-eight ohms,

458
00:30:18,51 --> 00:30:23,946
and I can give you one over
omega C, that is three hundred

459
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:28,047
and thirty two ohms.
So notice that this is,

460
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:33,77
by far, the dominant player in
the game, compared to omega L.

461
00:30:33,77 --> 00:30:39,97
In case you're interested in
the resonance frequency,

462
00:30:39,97 --> 00:30:44,22
omega zero is one over the
square root of L C,

463
00:30:44,22 --> 00:30:49,321
and that is about eleven
hundred and twenty radians per

464
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:51,399
second.
In other words,

465
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,705
my driver is nowhere near
resonance.

466
00:30:54,705 --> 00:30:59,051
I am way below resonance.
When you're way below

467
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:02,546
resonance, it is the C that
dominates.

468
00:31:02,546 --> 00:31:06,797
Look at the three hundred and
thirty two ohms,

469
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:11,897
and compare that with the
thirty-eight.

470
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:16,322
I can calculate,
now, what the maximum current

471
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:18,485
is, that we get,
I Max.

472
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:21,238
That is V zero,
divided by Z,

473
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:25,269
that impedance,
so that is hundred and ten

474
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:29,792
square root two,
divided by three hundred ohms,

475
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,036
and that is oh point five
amperes.

476
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:39,23
And now I can tell you how much
power is dissipated in the light

477
00:31:39,23 --> 00:31:44,899
bulb, which is I square R.
So in the light bulb,

478
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:49,344
which is the only component
that has a resistance -- well,

479
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:52,23
maybe the L has,
also, a little bit of

480
00:31:52,23 --> 00:31:56,987
resistance, but we will ignore
that for now -- so in the light

481
00:31:56,987 --> 00:32:01,744
bulb, the average power over one
full cycle of my oscillations

482
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:06,111
equals the mean value between I
squared R, time averaged,

483
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:10,556
the time average value of
cosine omega T squared is always

484
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:15,391
one-half, so this one-half that
comes here is the result of the

485
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:20,293
fact that the I
there has a cosine omega T,

486
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:23,698
and you square that,
you get one half,

487
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:26,919
if you average it over
oscillations,

488
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,047
so now I get I Max squared
times R.

489
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:34,648
So this is one-half times my oh
point five squared,

490
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:40,262
and the R of the light bulb is
sixty, and this turns out to be

491
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:43,114
seven point five watts.
Nothing.

492
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:46,887
Why is it nothing?
Well, that's the way we

493
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:50,157
designed
this system.

494
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:54,847
We're way below resonance.
So if I plug the system in,

495
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:59,36
which I will do for you,
this two-hundred watt light

496
00:32:59,36 --> 00:33:03,518
bulb will only dissipate seven
and a half watts,

497
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:07,589
and you won't see anything.
You ready for this?

498
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:09,447
Three, two, one,
zero.

499
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:12,101
Physics works.
You see nothing.

500
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:14,756
Light bulb, not working.
Great.

501
00:33:14,756 --> 00:33:19,977
So now comes the question,
what could we do

502
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:24,097
to get the system back on
resonance?

503
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:31,162
Well, we know that our driving
frequency is three hundred and

504
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:34,93
seventy seven radians per
second.

505
00:33:34,93 --> 00:33:41,052
And so what we could do,
we could change the C in the

506
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:46,351
circuit, and we could change L
in the circuit.

507
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:51,446
If we increase C,
or we increase L,

508
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:57,477
then the resonance frequency
will shift from eleven twenty

509
00:33:57,477 --> 00:34:01,392
down, make L larger,
or make C larger,

510
00:34:01,392 --> 00:34:05,624
then, obviously,
you shift your resonance

511
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:10,491
frequency down.
And my goal is to shift it down

512
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:16,099
to three hundred and seventy
seven radians per second.

513
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:21,856
I first want to make a curve
for you here,

514
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:26,312
very roughly,
of I Max as a function of

515
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:30,417
frequency, omega,
and that's the de-

516
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:36,632
demonstration I just did.
When this was eleven hundred

517
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:43,551
and twenty, we had about oh
point five amperes at R value of

518
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:50,939
three hundred and seventy seven.
So this is one point over I Max

519
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:56,966
versus omega curve.
I can now ask the question,

520
00:34:56,966 --> 00:35:01,04
if we drive the system at
resonance, what then,

521
00:35:01,04 --> 00:35:04,14
would have been the maximum
current?

522
00:35:04,14 --> 00:35:07,062
We're not driving it at
resonance.

523
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:10,693
But suppose we had driven it at
resonance.

524
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:15,387
Well, at resonance -- so at
resonance, I Max is V zero

525
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:19,107
divided by R.
There is no resi- there is no

526
00:35:19,107 --> 00:35:24,333
self-inductor,
and there is no capacitance at

527
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:27,055
resonance.
And so that would then be

528
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:29,778
hundred and ten,
square root of two,

529
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:33,045
divided by sixty.
But that is two point six

530
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:35,846
amperes.
That is substantially larger

531
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:39,347
than one-half.
So this value here is two point

532
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:42,536
six amperes.
It is too bad that I can't go

533
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:47,437
there, because I am stuck to me
three hundred and seventy seven,

534
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,927
and I'm not going to change
that.

535
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:55,606
Throughout the demonstration,
I stick to my driver here.

536
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:59,218
So keep in mind that the driver
is always here,

537
00:35:59,218 --> 00:36:02,988
I don't change that.
So the resonance curve -- we

538
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:06,601
call this the resonance curve --
is very broad,

539
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:10,449
something like this.
And I believe the Q is around

540
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:13,119
2, you can check that for
yourself.

541
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,124
I can calculate what the power
is, that the  bulb is

542
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:21,13
dissipating at resonance.
Well, that is my one-half,

543
00:36:21,13 --> 00:36:26,235
which is the time-average
cosine squared --

544
00:36:26,235 --> 00:36:29,674
my I Max is now point -- two
point six amperes,

545
00:36:29,674 --> 00:36:33,936
so now I get two point six
squared -- and my resistance is

546
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:37,6
still sixty ohms -- and this is
two hundred watts.

547
00:36:37,6 --> 00:36:41,264
What a coincidence,
that's the way we designed the

548
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:44,405
experiment.
So if we could be at resonance,

549
00:36:44,405 --> 00:36:48,443
the light bulb would be happy
like a clam at high tide,

550
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:53,079
it's exactly two hundred watts.
It wants two point six amperes,

551
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,742
that's what it wants.
Then it is a

552
00:36:56,742 --> 00:37:01,075
two hundred watt light bulb.
And so we want to make the

553
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:04,284
light bulb happy.
And how can we do that?

554
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:08,457
Well, we can either increase L,
or we can increase C.

555
00:37:08,457 --> 00:37:12,869
And I want to catch two birds
with one stone during this

556
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:16,239
demonstration,
I'm going to teach you a way

557
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,411
that you can increase L,
something that we have never

558
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:22,738
discussed before.
I have here,

559
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:26,75
ferromagnetic material,
which has a value for kappa

560
00:37:26,75 --> 00:37:32,274
somewhere around ten,
twelve -- let's say it is ten

561
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:37,568
for now -- so that means that if
I bring that iron core inside,

562
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:41,068
that I could make this go up to
one Henry.

563
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:45,081
Because remember,
the meaning of self-inductance

564
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:49,349
is the flux divided by the
current in the solenoid.

565
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:53,704
And so if you bring in
ferromagnetic material with a

566
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,204
kappa M of ten,
then the flux goes up by a

567
00:37:57,204 --> 00:38:01,591
factor of ten.
The current remains the same,

568
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:04,759
and therefore your
self-inductance goes up by a

569
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:07,788
factor of ten.
So you see that you can make a

570
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:11,369
variable self-inductance by
bringing in ferromagnetic

571
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,71
material, and by removing it
again.

572
00:38:13,71 --> 00:38:17,084
And so the question,
now, is, how high should L be

573
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:20,045
to get on resonance?
Well, that's very easy,

574
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:23,625
because we know that one over
the square root of L C,

575
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:27,343
we want to make that three
hundred and seventy [break],

576
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:30,992
that's our driver.
But we know that

577
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:33,806
C is eight microfarads,
that's a God-given,

578
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:37,891
we're not going to change that.
And so you can easily show now

579
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:41,575
that if we could only make L oh
point eight eight Henry,

580
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:45,661
we should be back on resonance.
Then we have three hundred and

581
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:48,943
seventy seven radians per second
as our resonance.

582
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:52,694
And you shouldn't be surprised
that omega L is then three

583
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:56,512
hundred and thirty two ohms.
Of course it is three hundred

584
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,329
and thirty two ohms,
because it's going to

585
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:04,224
eat up that one over omega C,
they're going to cancel each

586
00:39:04,224 --> 00:39:06,548
other.
That's another way you could

587
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:10,784
have calculated the value of L,
by simply saying omega L has to

588
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:14,884
be three hundred and thirty two.
So there are various ways to

589
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:18,505
get your resonance frequency.
And so what I have done,

590
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:21,922
if I make L oh point eight
eight Henry, I shift the

591
00:39:21,922 --> 00:39:25,748
resonance frequency to this
value, and my resonance curve

592
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:29,438
now will look like this.
But this height is going to be

593
00:39:29,438 --> 00:39:33,059
the same, because the height is
only

594
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:36,989
determined by V zero and R.
And so what I'm going to do now

595
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:40,918
is I'm going to turn on the
instrument where it was before,

596
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:43,967
[unintelligible] this was the
resonance curve,

597
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:47,558
you won't see any light.
And I'm going to move the bar

598
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:51,081
in, I probably don't have to
move it in all they way,

599
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:54,401
and then the light bulb will go
through resonance,

600
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:58,33
the system will go through
resonance, you will get your two

601
00:39:58,33 --> 00:40:01,311
point six amperes,
and the light bulb will be

602
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:03,411
happy.
And so let's do that now.

603
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:07,137
All right?
So here, system is now --

604
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:09,583
current is going.
Sixty Hertz,

605
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:13,882
hundred and ten volts.
[unintelligible] square as we

606
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:18,435
call that, and it's way off
resonance, seven and a half

607
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:22,145
watts, the light bulb doesn't
even feel warm.

608
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:27,119
And now I bring the -- this
enormous piece of iron in there,

609
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,672
and when I shove it in,
the self-inductance will slowly

610
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:36,478
go up, the resonance frequency
will shirt, and the current

611
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:40,525
through the system will
increase.

612
00:40:40,525 --> 0.
And there we go.

613
0. --> 00:40:41,759

614
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:44,156
There it is.
I'm on resonance now.

615
00:40:44,156 --> 00:40:46,48
So the light bulb is quite
happy.

616
00:40:46,48 --> 00:40:50,183
I want to do one more thing.
I'm going to double the

617
00:40:50,183 --> 00:40:53,233
capacitance.
And what happens when I double

618
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,412
the capacitance?
The frequency,

619
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:59,189
the resonance frequency goes
further down that it was

620
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:02,892
already, because remember,
when you increase L or C,

621
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:05,289
the resonance frequency goes
down.

622
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:08,049
So I'm going to double the
capacitance.

623
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:12,478
So that curve that you see on
the

624
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:16,582
left there, has shifted,
now, even further to the left.

625
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:19,318
And the light bulb is not very
happy.

626
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:23,421
The light bulb is -- the system
is off resonance again.

627
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:27,525
But if I increase C -- I
doubled it -- I can decrease L

628
00:41:27,525 --> 00:41:31,097
by a factor of two,
all I have to do is pull the

629
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:33,984
iron slowly out.
And then the resonance

630
00:41:33,984 --> 00:41:38,088
frequency comes back at three
hundred and seventy seven

631
00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:40,216
radians per second.
Watch it.

632
00:41:40,216 --> 00:41:44,32
Back on resonance.
Amazing, isn't it?

633
00:41:44,32 --> 00:41:46,358
Physics works.
So I showed you this

634
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:48,997
demonstration,
and I spent so much time on it

635
00:41:48,997 --> 00:41:52,655
because I wanted you to be able
to appreciate -- I want you to

636
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:54,933
be able to see through these
equations.

637
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:57,692
The answer, in physics,
in general, lies in the

638
00:41:57,692 --> 00:42:01,469
equations, but it only works if
you build up a certain amount of

639
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:03,988
understanding.
And that is not always easy,

640
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,907
and the demonstrations help
that.

641
00:42:05,907 --> 00:42:08,725
Seeing is believing.
And you may have to go over

642
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:11,543
this at home in order to digest
it a little bit.

643
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:16,101
I don't expect you to get all
this just in one lecture,

644
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:19,256
of course not.
We have a new impedance here,

645
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:23,367
we have the reactance here,
we have the idea that omega L

646
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:26,523
eats up omega C,
then we get into resonance,

647
00:42:26,523 --> 00:42:29,458
all these phenomenon take time
to digest.

648
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:33,642
There are many key practical
applications in LRC circuits,

649
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:37,312
more than you may think.
Your radio and your TV are

650
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:40,101
systems that you,
without realizing it,

651
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:43,477
you tune them to resonance.
There's an antenna,

652
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:48,285
and that receives many,
many stations at all different

653
00:42:48,285 --> 00:42:51,217
frequencies, and you are
changing -- in general,

654
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:54,213
you change the capacitor.
And when you change the

655
00:42:54,213 --> 00:42:57,894
capacitor in the LRC circuit,
you are changing the resonance

656
00:42:57,894 --> 00:43:01,701
frequency, and at that resonance
frequency, the system is very

657
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:05,008
sensitive, drives a very high
current, and it selects,

658
00:43:05,008 --> 00:43:07,754
then, a particular station at
that frequency.

659
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:11,498
That's what you're doing with
your TV, and that's what you're

660
00:43:11,498 --> 00:43:14,493
doing with your radio.
You're changing a variable

661
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:16,864
capacitor.
Another application which is

662
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:20,919
quite
common are metal detectors.

663
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:25,817
Metal detectors are resonant
circuits, they are set at

664
00:43:25,817 --> 00:43:30,252
resonance, and then,
when you bring metal nearby,

665
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:35,149
you bring them off resonance,
and then the alarm goes.

666
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:39,862
In general, they have two coils
-- this is one coil,

667
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:43,743
and this is another coil.
Inductance L one,

668
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,792
resistor R one,
capacitance C one,

669
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,472
L two, R two,
C

670
00:43:49,472 --> 00:43:51,704
two.
And so there's a current,

671
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:55,939
I one, running through this
one, a current I two running

672
00:43:55,939 --> 00:43:59,25
through that one.
To set up the differential

673
00:43:59,25 --> 00:44:02,33
equations for this system is not
so easy.

674
00:44:02,33 --> 00:44:05,795
You get two differential
equations, of course,

675
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:09,183
one for this system,
and one for this system.

676
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:13,88
The problem -- but at the same
time the trick -- is that there

677
00:44:13,88 --> 00:44:18,5
is a mutual inductance between
the two, because when this one

678
00:44:18,5 --> 00:44:23,717
produces a current I two,
there is a magnetic flux going

679
00:44:23,717 --> 00:44:26,691
through this one.
That's why we call it mutual

680
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:30,789
inductance, which we have never
really dealt with in any detail

681
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:32,706
in eight oh two,
and we won't.

682
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:36,871
But I want to mention that this
differential equation here is an

683
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:38,92
equation in I one,
L one, R one,

684
00:44:38,92 --> 00:44:42,291
C one, but also contains a term
N times D I two D T.

685
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:45,86
And this differential equation
is an equation in L two,

686
00:44:45,86 --> 00:44:48,438
R two, C two,
I two, but also contains a

687
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:53,925
term, N times D I one D T.
And so now you get two coupled

688
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:56,945
differential equations.
It's not just one in I one,

689
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,725
and one in I two.
It is one in I one and I two,

690
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:02,141
and it is another one in I one
and I two.

691
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:05,646
And that is a pain in the neck,
and it's not easy to solve.

692
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:08,546
But there are mathematicians
who can do all that,

693
00:45:08,546 --> 00:45:10,842
and they solved that for us
physicists.

694
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,44
In any case,
what is important that clearly,

695
00:45:13,44 --> 00:45:16,219
since you have two coils,
you get two resonance

696
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:19,36
frequencies, not just one,
but you have two resonance

697
00:45:19,36 --> 00:45:21,596
frequencies.
And at least one of those

698
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:25,024
resonance
frequencies depends very

699
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:27,245
strongly on the mutual
inductance.

700
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:30,745
And so the system is tuned to
set at one of these two

701
00:45:30,745 --> 00:45:33,909
resonance frequencies.
And now someone brings in

702
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:36,197
metal.
You bring in a chu- chunk of

703
00:45:36,197 --> 00:45:38,486
metal.
And in this metal  the metal

704
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,716
will experience the magnetic
field, flux changes,

705
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:44,072
A C of course,
always, in the metal,

706
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:46,697
it will start building up eddy
currents.

707
00:45:46,697 --> 00:45:50,534
And so the eddy currents will
change the magnetic coupling

708
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:55,214
between these two loops.
And so M changes.

709
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:58,149
And when M changes,
you go off resonance,

710
00:45:58,149 --> 00:46:01,671
and bingo, your alarm goes off.
Clearly, and very

711
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:04,752
unfortunately,
this never works for plastic

712
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:06,954
bombs.
You must have conducting

713
00:46:06,954 --> 00:46:10,549
material that you bring in,
so it must be a metal.

714
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:14,731
These systems have very high Q,
very high Q means they are

715
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:17,96
extremely sensitive.
If you have very high Q,

716
00:46:17,96 --> 00:46:22,435
that curve is extremely narrow,
and so the slightest change in

717
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:26,398
M, you go off resonance,
and you get

718
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:29,116
your alarm.
And so they come in various

719
00:46:29,116 --> 00:46:31,548
forms, and in various
applications.

720
00:46:31,548 --> 00:46:33,909
At the airport,
it is very simple.

721
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:36,198
You walk through these two
coils.

722
00:46:36,198 --> 00:46:40,418
You may not have realized that,
but you simply walk through.

723
00:46:40,418 --> 00:46:43,637
You walk through,
like, there's one coil here,

724
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:46,57
one coil there,
and that's how they detect

725
00:46:46,57 --> 00:46:49,288
whether you have any,
uh, metal on you.

726
00:46:49,288 --> 00:46:53,437
The one -- the metal detectors
that are used to search your

727
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:57,73
body, including the ones that
are used to

728
00:46:57,73 --> 00:47:01,434
search the ground for coins --
uh, when I was a kid,

729
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:04,629
I went often to the beach in
the Netherlands,

730
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:08,478
and there were often people who
were having this metal

731
00:47:08,478 --> 00:47:11,238
detectors, they were looking for
coins.

732
00:47:11,238 --> 00:47:14,87
And those metal detectors,
basically the same idea,

733
00:47:14,87 --> 00:47:18,792
always two coils -- this is
this coil, and this is this

734
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:22,859
coil, and when metal comes
nearby, you have a system that

735
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,909
goes off resonance,
you get a difference --

736
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,541
magnetic coupling between the
two

737
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:32,186
coils, and the system goes into
alarm.

738
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:36,405
And I'd like to demonstrate
that, for wh- for which I need a

739
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:38,693
student.
Any student who wants to

740
00:47:38,693 --> 00:47:41,839
volunteer, I have here a metal
detector, and,

741
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,842
thank goodness,
we don't have to go through

742
00:47:44,842 --> 00:47:47,774
metal detectors yet,
at MIT -- you want to

743
00:47:47,774 --> 00:47:49,776
volunteer?
Boy, you're brave,

744
00:47:49,776 --> 00:47:53,923
you're all the way at the end
of the -- can't wait what you

745
00:47:53,923 --> 00:47:57,498
have in store for us.
Oh, you look like you're made

746
00:47:57,498 --> 00:48:00,287
of steel.
OK, you -- I hope you left all

747
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:04,722
your
secret weapons up there,

748
00:48:04,722 --> 00:48:07,48
did you?
[unintelligible].

749
00:48:07,48 --> 00:48:14,43
So this is a -- this is a metal
detector, and if you opened this

750
00:48:14,43 --> 00:48:20,056
up here, you would see two
coils, one in the center,

751
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:23,255
and one near the edge.
[beep].

752
00:48:23,255 --> 00:48:28,991
And we have to -- I have to
calibrate it first -- OK.

753
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:33,183
Oh, you left your cigarettes
out there?

754
00:48:33,183 --> 00:48:41,296
They -- they won't record it.
Student: Definitely not

755
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:44,647
working.
No, that's probably not

756
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:47,674
working.
Well, just a second,

757
00:48:47,674 --> 0.
may have to recalibrate this.

758
0. --> 00:48:50,918

759
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:55,566
Pretty quiet.
Doesn't look like you have any

760
00:48:55,566 --> 00:49:00,215
metal there.
I'm pr- fairly sure I turned it

761
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:03,026
on.
They don't always work,

762
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:06,053
do they?
Marcos, you have any

763
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:11,701
[unintelligible]?
[beep] Uh-uh.

764
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:16,182
It's working.
No, it's not working very well.

765
00:49:16,182 --> 00:49:19,645
It's working well here.
[laughter].

766
00:49:19,645 --> 00:49:25,144
Wonder what you got there.
Are you metal -- is this not

767
00:49:25,144 --> 00:49:29,115
made of metal,
all these things in here?

768
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:35,225
Student: I have lots of metal
on me, and [unintelligible] I'm

769
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:40,113
surprised it's only going off at
the belt buckle,

770
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:44,289
it's weird.
Oh, you may be a weird person,

771
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:49,38
that may be [laughter].
[beeping].

772
00:49:49,38 --> 00:49:53,67
Can you turn around?
Oh, that's your watch.

773
00:49:53,67 --> 00:49:55,815
[beeping].
[laughter].

774
00:49:55,815 --> 00:50:01,331
You'd better turn around again.
Ah, there are the keys.

775
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:06,234
You're not made of steel,
but you're a great guy,

776
00:50:06,234 --> 00:50:09,4
thank you very much.
[applause].

777
00:50:09,4 --> 00:50:11,954
Today is Wednesday,
right?

778
00:50:11,954 --> 50:17
See you Friday.
