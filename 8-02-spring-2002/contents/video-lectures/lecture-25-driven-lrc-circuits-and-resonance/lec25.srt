1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
So we have covered RC circuits
and RL circuits,

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
and today, we will spend the
entire lecture on LRC circuits.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:19
We will only discuss them in
series so that you get the basic

4
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
idea.
I have here a driving power

5
00:00:25 --> 00:00:31
supply, alternating,
and here I have a

6
00:00:30 --> 00:00:36
capacitor C,
self-inductor L,

7
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
and a resistance R,
this is AC,

8
00:00:38 --> 00:00:44
and let the driving voltage be
V0 cosine omega T.

9
00:00:44 --> 00:00:50
We have to set up the
differential equation for this,

10
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
and I want to remind you that
Kirchhoff's Loop Rule does not

11
00:00:58 --> 00:01:04
hold.
So the closed loop

12
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
integral of E dot dL,
in spite of what the author of

13
00:01:06 --> 00:01:12
your book wants you to believe,
that is not 0.

14
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
So how do we set it up?
There are various ways that you

15
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
can do that, I have my own
discipline.

16
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
I, in my mind,
I think of this first being a,

17
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
a battery -- by this is the
plus side, and this is the minus

18
00:01:26 --> 00:01:32
side -- a current is going to
flow, capacitor is going to

19
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
charge up, electric field inside
the capacitor

20
00:01:35 --> 00:01:41
is in this direction,
the electric field in the

21
00:01:39 --> 00:01:45
self-inductor is always 0,
because the self-inductor has

22
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
no resistance.
There's no electric field

23
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
inside the self-inductor,
no matter what some of your

24
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
books want you to believe.
Then, the electric field in the

25
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
resistor is in this direction,
and the electric field inside

26
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
the power supply goes from plus
to minus, would be in this

27
00:02:04 --> 00:02:10
direction.
So if I set up the differential

28
00:02:09 --> 00:02:15
equation, I start here,
I always go in the same

29
00:02:12 --> 00:02:18
direction as I,
because only then is the closed

30
00:02:16 --> 00:02:22
loop integral -L dI/dt.
So I go over this capacitor,

31
00:02:20 --> 00:02:26
that is V of C,
then I go through the wire of

32
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
the self-inductor.
There is no electric field,

33
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
so the integral E dot dL there
is 0.

34
00:02:30 --> 00:02:36
Then I go through the resistor,
so I get IR,

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:40
and then I have here my power
supply, so I get -V0

36
00:02:38 --> 00:02:44
cosine
omega T, and that,

37
00:02:42 --> 00:02:48
now, according to Faraday's
Law, equals L, minus L dI/dt.

38
00:02:47 --> 00:02:53
The current equals dQ/dt.
If the current is positive --

39
00:02:52 --> 00:02:58
this is my positive direction --
then the charge of the capacitor

40
00:02:58 --> 00:03:04
will increase.
And I also know that V of C,

41
00:03:01 --> 00:03:07
the potential difference over
the capacitor is the charge on

42
00:03:07 --> 00:03:13
each one of the capacitor
plates,

43
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
divided by C.
And so I substitute that in

44
00:03:14 --> 00:03:20
this equation,
and I bring the L dI/dt to the

45
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
left side.
That is conventionally done.

46
00:03:22 --> 00:03:28
You don't have to do that,
but that's often done.

47
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
So I get a plus L,
dI/dt now becomes d2Q/dt

48
00:03:31 --> 00:03:37
squared -- my goal is to get
everything in terms of Q -- then

49
00:03:37 --> 00:03:43
my IR become R dQ/dt,
and my V of C becomes Q / C

50
00:03:44 --> 00:03:50
-- notice that I ranked
them in order,

51
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
D2Q/dt squared,
dQ/dt, and then Q,

52
00:03:50 --> 00:03:56
you don't have to do that,
but there is nothing wrong with

53
00:03:55 --> 00:04:01
doing that -- and then we get
here, equals V0 cosine omega

54
00:04:00 --> 00:04:06
T.
And this is the form in which

55
00:04:03 --> 00:04:09
most books would present this
differential equation.

56
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
And they arrive that in various
ways, most books arrive at this

57
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
equation in a completely wrong
way, but they get -- anyhow,

58
00:04:17 --> 00:04:23
they end up with this equation.
And so, you have to solve this

59
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
equation, which is really beyond
your present abilities,

60
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
it's second-order differential
equation, it's really part of

61
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
18.03,
so I will give you the

62
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
solution.
The basic idea being that you

63
00:04:34 --> 00:04:40
find a solution for Q as a
function of time,

64
00:04:37 --> 00:04:43
and once you know Q as a
function of time,

65
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
you have, of course,
the current,

66
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
because then you take
the derivative of your

67
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
solution, and you get the
current.

68
00:04:50 --> 00:04:56
I will give you the current as
a function of time.

69
00:04:55 --> 00:05:01
So I, that satisfies that
differential equation,

70
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
is the V0 divided by
[whistles] R squared + omega

71
00:05:06 --> 00:05:12
L - one over omega C
squared, and the whole thing

72
00:05:12 --> 00:05:18
times cosine omega T minus phi.
And the tangent of phi equals

73
00:05:21 --> 00:05:27
omega L minus one over omega C
divided by R.

74
00:05:27 --> 00:05:33
We give this upstairs here a
name, we call that the

75
00:05:34 --> 00:05:40
reactance.
The reactance,

76
00:05:38 --> 00:05:44
and that X, or sometimes it's
called chi, is omega L minus one

77
00:05:47 --> 00:05:53
over omega
C.

78
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
And the units are also ohms.
We call the entire square root

79
00:05:56 --> 00:06:02
that you see here,
we call that capital Z,

80
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
which is called the impedance,
so the square root of R squared

81
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
plus that X squared equals Z,
that also has units of ohm,

82
00:06:13 --> 00:06:19
and that is called the
impedance.

83
00:06:16 --> 00:06:22
And so Z is an effective
resistance, because this whole

84
00:06:22 --> 00:06:28
thing behaves
like a resistance.

85
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
But the resistance depends not
only on R, L and C,

86
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
but also on the values of
omega.

87
00:06:32 --> 00:06:38
This solution is what we call a
steady-state solution,

88
00:06:36 --> 00:06:42
it is the solution that you get
if you wait a certain amount of

89
00:06:40 --> 00:06:46
time.
If you turn the instrument on,

90
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
so you all of a sudden start
this experiment,

91
00:06:46 --> 00:06:52
then in the beginning,
you get a different solution,

92
00:06:50 --> 00:06:56
which is more complicated,
you get

93
00:06:54 --> 00:07:00
transient phenomenon,
but these transient phenomenon

94
00:06:58 --> 00:07:04
die out, and you end up with
this solution.

95
00:07:01 --> 00:07:07
Now, there are several
interesting things that you can

96
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
see in this solution.
We have to start digesting,

97
00:07:08 --> 00:07:14
this whole hour,
this solution.

98
00:07:10 --> 00:07:16
It has very interesting
aspects.

99
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
For one thing,
you can see that the current

100
00:07:16 --> 00:07:22
can be delayed over the driving
voltage when phi is positive.

101
00:07:20 --> 00:07:26
Then the current comes later
than

102
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
the voltage.
And that's the result of the

103
00:07:26 --> 00:07:32
inductor, we've discussed that
before.

104
00:07:29 --> 00:07:35
But now, that's also possible
that the current is leading the

105
00:07:33 --> 00:07:39
voltage, which is very hard to
understand intuitively.

106
00:07:36 --> 00:07:42
That is the case when this term
dominates over this one,

107
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
then phi becomes negative,
and so minus phi becomes

108
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
positive.
If minus phi is positive,

109
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
the current is leading the
voltage.

110
00:07:47 --> 00:07:53
Now you may say,
"How can it possibly be?

111
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
Does that meant that before I
switch the instrument on,

112
00:07:55 --> 00:08:01
that I already have a current?"
Of course it doesn't mean that.

113
00:07:59 --> 00:08:05
But that's the transient
solution, remember?

114
00:08:03 --> 00:08:09
When you turn something on,
when you switch it on,

115
00:08:07 --> 00:08:13
this solution doesn't hold yet.
This is the steady-state

116
00:08:11 --> 00:08:17
solution.
So the value for I Max,

117
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
we have always called what is
front of the cosine term,

118
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
we've always called that I Max,
that value for I Max is a

119
00:08:22 --> 00:08:28
function of omega itself --
as we will analyze in detail

120
00:08:27 --> 00:08:33
today -- and of course,
also, of R, L and C.

121
00:08:31 --> 00:08:37
And there is one particular
value for Z, and therefore for

122
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
omega, whereby this value
reaches a maximum,

123
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
and that's what we call
resonance.

124
00:08:43 --> 00:08:49
There is no value for omega
for which the current is any

125
00:08:48 --> 00:08:54
higher.
And so I will call here,

126
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
the situation,
at resonance.

127
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
It is at resonance when X
equals

128
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
0, so when omega L is one
over omega C,

129
00:09:01 --> 00:09:07
so when omega is one over the
square root of L C.

130
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
And we call that the resonance
frequency, and we often give a

131
00:09:11 --> 00:09:17
little subscript 0 there to remind you that you're dealing with the

132
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
resonance frequency.
And Z is then just R,

133
00:09:21 --> 00:09:27
because when X is 0,
the omega L and the one over

134
00:09:25 --> 00:09:31
omega C eat each other up.
They are not there any more,

135
00:09:31 --> 00:09:37
it's gone.
And so the system behaves as if

136
00:09:34 --> 00:09:40
there were only a resistor.
And so you also see that the

137
00:09:39 --> 00:09:45
maximum current that you get is
then, simply,

138
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
V0 divided by that value
for R, because Z,

139
00:09:46 --> 00:09:52
the impedance,
is now R.

140
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
And in addition,
if you're interested in phi,

141
00:09:51 --> 00:09:57
phi then becomes 0,
so the driving voltage is then

142
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
in phase with the current that
follows.

143
00:09:59 --> 00:10:05
And so the signal that you will
see

144
00:10:03 --> 00:10:09
is a cosinusoidal variation in
the current, so if I have here

145
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
the current as a function of
time, and you get a signal like

146
00:10:17 --> 00:10:23
so, and this here,
this period T equals your

147
00:10:23 --> 00:10:29
2 pi / omega. 
So that is the -- directly

148
00:10:29 --> 00:10:35
connected to your driving
frequency.

149
00:10:33 --> 00:10:39
And if the impedance Z is very
low,

150
00:10:39 --> 00:10:45
then this maximum value of the
current, this is what we call

151
00:10:43 --> 00:10:49
the maximum value -- and,
of course, the maximum value is

152
00:10:47 --> 00:10:53
also here, except that the
cosine is -1 here,

153
00:10:50 --> 00:10:56
and the cosine is +1 here
-- so if Z is very low,

154
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
then this will be high.
If Z is very high,

155
00:10:57 --> 00:11:03
this will be low.
And there is only one and one

156
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
value of Z for which the system
is at resonance,

157
00:11:03 --> 00:11:09
and that is when the
self-inductance and the

158
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
capacitor eat each other up,
and then you get the maximum

159
00:11:11 --> 00:11:17
possible value for the current
at maximum, which is V0 over

160
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
R.
And that's the highest value

161
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
that you could ever get them.
Imagine that we have an LRC

162
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
circuit, and we have L and R and
C fixed, but we change the

163
00:11:29 --> 00:11:35
driving frequency.
So we move over various values

164
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
of Z by changing omega from a
very low value to a very high

165
00:11:38 --> 00:11:44
value.
If you start at a very low

166
00:11:41 --> 00:11:47
value for
omega, let's say it approaches

167
00:11:46 --> 00:11:52
0, then notice that Z goes to
infinity, and so the maximum

168
00:11:51 --> 00:11:57
current becomes 0.
And the person responsible for

169
00:11:56 --> 00:12:02
that is the capacitor,
because if omega goes to 0,

170
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
this goes to infinity.
And that's intuitively

171
00:12:04 --> 00:12:10
pleasing, because omega 0
really means you have no AC any

172
00:12:09 --> 00:12:15
more, you have DC.
And with DC,

173
00:12:13 --> 00:12:19
what you're doing is,
you charge up the capacitor

174
00:12:16 --> 00:12:22
when it's fully charged,
no current can flow any more.

175
00:12:20 --> 00:12:26
So that's intuitively pleasing.
When omega becomes very high,

176
00:12:25 --> 00:12:31
let's call it infinity,
then Z, again,

177
00:12:27 --> 00:12:33
goes to infinity.
So again, the maximum current,

178
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
again goes to 0.
And the person responsible for

179
00:12:35 --> 00:12:41
that is the self-inductor,
because when omega goes to

180
00:12:38 --> 00:12:44
infinity, again,
Z goes to infinity.

181
00:12:41 --> 00:12:47
So again,
you get 0 here.

182
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
And that's also intuitively
pleasing, because if you have an

183
00:12:49 --> 00:12:55
infinitely high frequency,
that means the self-inductance

184
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
puts up an enormous fight.
It's ideal for a self-inductor

185
00:12:57 --> 00:13:03
to fight currents if the time
over which the changes occur go

186
00:13:01 --> 00:13:07
to 0.
And so, then,

187
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
again, it says,
"Sorry, you can't have any

188
00:13:06 --> 00:13:12
current." So that's also
intuitively pleasing,

189
00:13:09 --> 00:13:15
that the self-inductance,
then, becomes the dominant

190
00:13:13 --> 00:13:19
factor.
And so what I can do now,

191
00:13:17 --> 00:13:23
I can plot the I Max as a
function of omega.

192
00:13:21 --> 00:13:27
So here is omega,
and here is I Max,

193
00:13:24 --> 00:13:30
and we already agreed that when
omega is 0,

194
00:13:28 --> 00:13:34
then I Max is 0.
But when omega is very high,

195
00:13:33 --> 00:13:39
it's also 0.
But when omega is at resonance,

196
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
omega 0, which is one over
the square root of L C -- notice

197
00:13:42 --> 00:13:48
that R has nothing to
do with the resonant frequency,

198
00:13:48 --> 00:13:54
it's really determined by L and
C, because it's the chi,

199
00:13:52 --> 00:13:58
it's the X that you want to
make 0, and X is only a

200
00:13:55 --> 00:14:01
function of L and C -- at this
frequency, we have a value here

201
00:13:59 --> 00:14:05
which is V0 divided by R.
And so the curve that you're

202
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
going to see,
which we call the resonance

203
00:14:06 --> 00:14:12
curve, is something like this.
You start out with an extremely

204
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
small current,
you go through resonance,

205
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
we have a high current,
and then at high frequencies,

206
00:14:16 --> 00:14:22
again,
you go down to 0.

207
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
And so the left part,
when you are below resonance,

208
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
it's really the capacitance
which is the dominant guy in the

209
00:14:31 --> 00:14:37
whole game -- and phi,
by the way, is here,

210
00:14:35 --> 00:14:41
less than 0 -- here it is
the  inductor that plays the key

211
00:14:41 --> 00:14:47
role, and here phi equals larger
than 0, and right here,

212
00:14:47 --> 00:14:53
phi, and only there,
phi is 0,

213
00:14:50 --> 00:14:56
only when you're exactly at
resonance.

214
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
I'd like to show you some
numerical results,

215
00:15:01 --> 00:15:07
and for that I have a
transparency -- it's also on the

216
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
web, so you don't have to copy
the numbers, uh,

217
00:15:11 --> 00:15:17
you can download them -- these
are just some numerical numbers

218
00:15:17 --> 00:15:23
which I want to digest with you,
so that you get a feeling for

219
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
the
effect, that you see it in

220
00:15:27 --> 00:15:33
front of your own eyes,
what is happening,

221
00:15:30 --> 00:15:36
how this curve evolves.
We have here a given R,

222
00:15:34 --> 00:15:40
L, and C: ten,
5 times 10 to the -2

223
00:15:38 --> 00:15:44
henry, and 3 times 10 to
the -7 farads.

224
00:15:42 --> 00:15:48
The resonant frequency is a
little over 

225
00:15:46 --> 00:15:52
radians per second,
you see it here in kilohertz,

226
00:15:50 --> 00:15:56
and you see here the impedance
-- and what I do here,

227
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01
I have a driving
frequency which is 10%

228
00:15:59 --> 00:16:05
below the resonance frequency.
And I calculate for you,

229
00:16:03 --> 00:16:09
the omega L,
which is

230
00:16:06 --> 00:16:12
ohms, and one over omega
C, which is

231
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
ohms.
You are a little bit below

232
00:16:12 --> 00:16:18
resonance, and so C dominates.
And you can see,

233
00:16:15 --> 00:16:21
indeed, that this ohm value is
larger than this one.

234
00:16:18 --> 00:16:24
And so out of that pops a value
for X, out of that pops a value

235
00:16:22 --> 00:16:28
for Z.
Notice that X is 86,

236
00:16:25 --> 00:16:31
and Z is only a hair larger
than 86,

237
00:16:29 --> 00:16:35
because this R almost
doesn't add to Z,

238
00:16:31 --> 00:16:37
because you get here the square
root of 10 squared plus

239
00:16:35 --> 00:16:41
86 squared,
that is almost 86.

240
00:16:38 --> 00:16:44
It becomes 87.
And then you see that the

241
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
current, the maximum current,
which is this value for V0

242
00:16:46 --> 00:16:52
divided by, uh,
the Z, by 87,

243
00:16:48 --> 00:16:54
becomes 0.11
amperes.

244
00:16:50 --> 00:16:56
And now, the system is driven
at resonance,

245
00:16:53 --> 00:16:59
and notice that it's exactly
characteristic for resonance

246
00:16:57 --> 00:17:03
that omega L
and one over omega C have the

247
00:17:01 --> 00:17:07
same value.
They are not there any more,

248
00:17:04 --> 00:17:10
they're gone.
And so X becomes 0,

249
00:17:07 --> 00:17:13
so the impedance becomes ohm --
10 ohms, which is the

250
00:17:10 --> 00:17:16
resistance, and so the maximum
current is now V0 divided by

251
00:17:15 --> 00:17:21
R, which is 1 amperes.
And when you're 10%

252
00:17:19 --> 00:17:25
over resonance,
then the self-inductor becomes

253
00:17:22 --> 00:17:28
to be more powerful than the
capacitor, and again,

254
00:17:25 --> 00:17:31
your current is substantially
down,

255
00:17:29 --> 00:17:35
in this, case,
8 times lower than at

256
00:17:34 --> 00:17:40
resonance.
We define, at a height  of 0.7

257
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
times the value at
resonance, we define a width of

258
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
this curve.
And this width is given in

259
00:17:51 --> 00:17:57
terms of delta omega.
And that width --

260
00:17:59 --> 00:18:05
and I will give you the answer
without mathematical proof,

261
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
it's not so difficult,
but it's a little bit of a

262
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
headache -- that value is R
divided by L.

263
00:18:13 --> 00:18:19
So the larger R is,
the broader it becomes.

264
00:18:17 --> 00:18:23
So if we look at delta omega,
for the numbers that we have

265
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
there, the numbers of the
transparency -- so this is for,

266
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
for the numbers that we have
there,

267
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
we have delta omega,
would be R, which is 10 ohms,

268
00:18:38 --> 00:18:44
divided by 5 times 10 to
the -2,

269
00:18:42 --> 00:18:48
and that is about
radians per second.

270
00:18:48 --> 00:18:54
We define Q not as charge --
don't never confuse that with

271
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
charge -- we call that the
quality of the resonance,

272
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
and the quality is defined as
omega 0

273
00:19:04 --> 00:19:10
divided by delta omega.
Now, omega 0 itself is one

274
00:19:09 --> 00:19:15
over the square root of L C,
and delta omega is R divided by

275
00:19:14 --> 00:19:20
L.
And so that makes the quality

276
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
1/R times the square root
of L/C.

277
00:19:21 --> 00:19:27
And the quality is the measure
for omega 0,

278
00:19:24 --> 00:19:30
which is this,
what I'm pointing at now,

279
00:19:28 --> 00:19:34
divided by delta omega,
which is this.

280
00:19:31 --> 00:19:37
So if the quality is high,
this peak is relatively narrow,

281
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
and
if the quality is low,

282
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
it's relatively wide.
You may ask yourself the

283
00:19:43 --> 00:19:49
question, why do we define delta
omega at 70% of the

284
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
maximum current at resonance?
Why not at half?

285
00:19:51 --> 00:19:57
There's a good reason for that,
because, in practice,

286
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
we are more interested in power
than that we are in currents.

287
00:20:00 --> 00:20:06
And power is proportional with
I squared.

288
00:20:03 --> 00:20:09
And so when you square this,
you get 0.5.

289
00:20:08 --> 00:20:14
And 0.5 means,
then, that this is really the

290
00:20:12 --> 00:20:18
width at half-power.
And so that's the reason why we

291
00:20:17 --> 00:20:23
chose the 0.7 times
the maximum current at

292
00:20:21 --> 00:20:27
resonance.
It's really the half-power

293
00:20:24 --> 00:20:30
width.
Resonance can be destructive.

294
00:20:27 --> 00:20:33
Uh, imagine,
if you have a very high-Q

295
00:20:30 --> 00:20:36
system, if you're slightly
off-resonance,

296
00:20:33 --> 00:20:39
there's almost no current,
no power dissipated in your

297
00:20:38 --> 00:20:44
resistor, and now,
you come,

298
00:20:42 --> 00:20:48
all of a sudden,
on the resonance,

299
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
you can an enormous current,
and that means there's an

300
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
enormous power dissipation in
your resistor,

301
00:20:50 --> 00:20:56
and you can burn out your
resistor.

302
00:20:52 --> 00:20:58
You can destroy your circuits,
if you're not careful.

303
00:20:56 --> 00:21:02
And next lecture and Monday,
I will also discuss with you

304
00:20:59 --> 00:21:05
some med- mechanical resonances.
Mechanical systems can also go

305
00:21:03 --> 00:21:09
into [unintelligible] can also
be destructive.

306
00:21:06 --> 00:21:12
At certain frequencies,
the systems behave -- call it

307
00:21:10 --> 00:21:16
k- violently,
they respond extremely strongly

308
00:21:12 --> 00:21:18
to
their input frequency,

309
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
and things can break.
Humans also have resonance

310
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
frequencies, you can call them,
if you want,

311
00:21:22 --> 00:21:28
emotional resonances.
All have sensitive nerves.

312
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
Someone makes a particular
remark, go through the roof.

313
00:21:30 --> 00:21:36
Also, falling in love,
when you think about it,

314
00:21:34 --> 00:21:40
is a resonance phenomenon,
and that, too,

315
00:21:37 --> 00:21:43
can be rather destructive.
As many of us know.

316
00:21:40 --> 00:21:46
But now I would like to
demonstrate to you the resonance

317
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
curves --
I'm going to choose particular

318
00:21:49 --> 00:21:55
values of, um,
R, L, and C,

319
00:21:52 --> 00:21:58
which I can change,
and then I will show you the

320
00:21:56 --> 00:22:02
current as a function of
frequency.

321
00:21:59 --> 00:22:05
And these are the values that I
have chosen.

322
00:22:03 --> 00:22:09
Again, this is on the Web,
you can download it,

323
00:22:07 --> 00:22:13
so you don't have to copy it
now.

324
00:22:10 --> 00:22:16
And I will change the -- the
light setting so that we can

325
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
also enjoy the demonstration.
The idea being that,

326
00:22:21 --> 00:22:27
for these values that I have
there, in the first line you see

327
00:22:26 --> 00:22:32
R, 60 ohms,
and the self-inductance is

328
00:22:29 --> 00:22:35
50 millihenry,
and the capacitance is 0.3

329
00:22:33 --> 00:22:39
microfarads.
So that's a given there.

330
00:22:36 --> 00:22:42
And I give you here the
resonance frequency,

331
00:22:39 --> 00:22:45
8000,
in terms of omega radians per

332
00:22:43 --> 00:22:49
second, this is the resonance
frequency in Hertz -- and just

333
00:22:47 --> 00:22:53
in case you're
interested, I gave you the Q

334
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
value there as well.
And what I'm going to do now

335
00:22:56 --> 00:23:02
for you, is I'm going to sweep
the input frequency from 0 to

336
00:23:01 --> 00:23:07
16000 radians per
second.

337
00:23:04 --> 00:23:10
So my omega can go from 0 to
16000.

338
00:23:08 --> 00:23:14
And I leave the values as they
are, here.

339
00:23:11 --> 00:23:17
So I'm going to sweep,
sweep over this 8000.

340
00:23:16 --> 00:23:22
And so you're going to see that
curve.

341
00:23:20 --> 00:23:26
Except that I'm show -- I'm
going to show you I as a

342
00:23:23 --> 00:23:29
function of frequency,
not I Max.

343
00:23:25 --> 00:23:31
And I is oscillating,
because there's a cosine term.

344
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
And so, for instance,
if I were here,

345
00:23:31 --> 00:23:37
with this value for omega,
you would see then that it goes

346
00:23:35 --> 00:23:41
up, it goes down,
it goes up, it goes down,

347
00:23:38 --> 00:23:44
it goes up, and it goes down.
And when I'm here,

348
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47
you will see this.
And keep that in mind when you

349
00:23:44 --> 00:23:50
look at the curve that you're
going to see there -- and so

350
00:23:48 --> 00:23:54
it's only the envelope,
then, that is the I Max.

351
00:23:53 --> 00:23:59
But you actually see the entire
current as a function of

352
00:23:58 --> 00:24:04
frequency.
And I am going to do that,

353
00:24:01 --> 00:24:07
then, for all these four values
that you see there.

354
00:24:06 --> 00:24:12
So, let's first change the
light so that we get an optimum

355
00:24:11 --> 00:24:17
situation for you.
And now, I will show you.

356
00:24:15 --> 00:24:21
Already, the results of the
first line -- so these are the

357
00:24:20 --> 00:24:26
values that you see
there.

358
00:24:25 --> 00:24:31
And I go -- I sl- I go very
slowly.

359
00:24:27 --> 00:24:33
Now omega is 0 here,
omega goes up,

360
00:24:30 --> 00:24:36
I go through resonance,
and omega is here,

361
00:24:34 --> 00:24:40
the value would be 16000 radians per second that

362
00:24:39 --> 00:24:45
we have here.
And it sweeps back and forth

363
00:24:42 --> 00:24:48
between 0 and 16000.

364
00:24:45 --> 00:24:51
So you see a dramatic increase
at resonance.

365
00:24:48 --> 00:24:54
So now what I'm going to do,
I'm going to double the

366
00:24:53 --> 00:24:59
self-inductance.
And when you double the

367
00:24:57 --> 00:25:03
self-inductance,
this one goes up,

368
00:24:59 --> 00:25:05
omega 0 goes down.
So all I want you to see,

369
00:25:02 --> 00:25:08
that the resonance frequency,
which is here -- that's the

370
00:25:06 --> 00:25:12
maximum -- that the resonance
frequency will shift.

371
00:25:10 --> 00:25:16
Because if L goes up by a
factor of 2,

372
00:25:12 --> 00:25:18
the resonant frequency will
come down by the square root of

373
00:25:16 --> 00:25:22
2.
And so I am going to increase L

374
00:25:19 --> 00:25:25
by a factor of 2 -- let me
make sure that I have the right

375
00:25:23 --> 00:25:29
knob here -- and this is my L.
Notice that the

376
00:25:27 --> 00:25:33
f- the resonant frequency is
now at a lower value,

377
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
it is here.
Also notice that the peak value

378
00:25:34 --> 00:25:40
at resonance has not changed.
Because the peak value at

379
00:25:38 --> 00:25:44
resonance, you see on the
blackboard here,

380
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
is V0 over R.
So as long as I don't change R,

381
00:25:45 --> 00:25:51
that doesn't change.
It's only the frequency that

382
00:25:49 --> 00:25:55
changes.
Omega 0 is one over the

383
00:25:51 --> 00:25:57
square root of LC.
That changes.

384
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
It is now here.
So I have increased L by a

385
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
factor of 2,
I can bring it back to my

386
00:26:01 --> 00:26:07
original resonance frequency by
now changing C.

387
00:26:04 --> 00:26:10
If you increase L by a factor of
2, all you have to do is

388
00:26:08 --> 00:26:14
decrease C by a factor of 2,
and you're back at the same

389
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
resonance.
So I'm going to make C down --

390
00:26:15 --> 00:26:21
C lower by a factor of 2,
which I'm doing now,

391
00:26:19 --> 00:26:25
and if you look,
now, here, and you have a good

392
00:26:22 --> 00:26:28
memory, you will see that the
resonant frequency is back where

393
00:26:26 --> 00:26:32
it was.
Again, V0 over R is not

394
00:26:29 --> 00:26:35
changed,
and the resonance frequency is

395
00:26:33 --> 00:26:39
back here, even though L is now
twice is higher,

396
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
and C is twice lower.
To show you the effect of R,

397
00:26:39 --> 00:26:45
I will double R now,
and I will leave everything

398
00:26:42 --> 00:26:48
else alone, so the resonance
frequency will stay here,

399
00:26:46 --> 00:26:52
but of course the maximum
current -- this high value will

400
00:26:49 --> 00:26:55
now come down,
because, you see,

401
00:26:51 --> 00:26:57
at resonance,
this value is V0 divided by

402
00:26:54 --> 00:27:00
R, and since R goes up by a
factor of 2,

403
00:26:57 --> 00:27:03
you will see that the maximum
current will go

404
00:27:01 --> 00:27:07
down by a factor of 2.
And so, I go now from 60 --

405
00:27:05 --> 00:27:11
from 50 -- oh,
no, I go from 60 to 

406
00:27:08 --> 00:27:14
100, I don't double it -- I
can't go any further than 

407
00:27:12 --> 00:27:18
100.
But you'll see a substantial

408
00:27:15 --> 00:27:21
reduction.
So if you're ready for this --

409
00:27:18 --> 00:27:24
remember this height -- and now
you see 100 ohms,

410
00:27:22 --> 00:27:28
and it is much lower.
It was this high before,

411
00:27:25 --> 00:27:31
and now it's only here.
But notice the resonance

412
00:27:29 --> 00:27:35
frequency has not changed.
So this is an extremely

413
00:27:33 --> 00:27:39
interesting behavior,
and every time,

414
00:27:35 --> 00:27:41
you have to think through what
is happening,

415
00:27:37 --> 00:27:43
you have not much intuition for
it, you're not alone,

416
00:27:40 --> 00:27:46
I don't have much intuition for
that either.

417
00:27:43 --> 00:27:49
But with these rather simple
equations -- they're really not

418
00:27:46 --> 00:27:52
that difficult -- here,
this is really the heart of the

419
00:27:49 --> 00:27:55
equation, and then,
of course, your tangent phi,

420
00:27:52 --> 00:27:58
in case you're interested in
the phase lags -- that they're

421
00:27:55 --> 00:28:01
really not that difficult.
I will not hold you responsible

422
00:27:58 --> 00:28:04
for being able to derive the r-
solution.

423
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
I give you the solution.
But with that solution,

424
00:28:05 --> 00:28:11
you can do a lot,
and you can understand the

425
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
behavior of these circuits quite
well.

426
00:28:11 --> 00:28:17
Now I'm going to do a
demonstration,

427
00:28:13 --> 00:28:19
and I warn you,
you have to very closely

428
00:28:16 --> 00:28:22
follow, step-by-step,
what I'm going to do.

429
00:28:19 --> 00:28:25
Because if you miss one small
step, you're lost for the next

430
00:28:23 --> 00:28:29
12 minutes.
Completely lost.

431
00:28:26 --> 00:28:32
You will just see nice things,
but you don't know what you're

432
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
looking at.
So follow me closely.

433
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
I have an LRC circuit.
And the LRC circuit is right

434
00:28:39 --> 00:28:45
here.
This is my L,

435
00:28:41 --> 00:28:47
0.1 Henry,
these are my Cs,

436
00:28:44 --> 00:28:50
and this is my R,
it's a 200 watt light

437
00:28:49 --> 00:28:55
bulb.
I have an LRC circuit.

438
00:28:52 --> 00:28:58
And I will give you the values
for L, for R,

439
00:28:56 --> 00:29:02
and for C.
I'm going to drive it at 60

440
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
hertz.
So omega equals

441
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
radians per
second.

442
00:29:07 --> 00:29:13
And whatever you're going to
see, for the next 12

443
00:29:11 --> 00:29:17
minutes, that is not going to
change.

444
00:29:14 --> 00:29:20
That frequency is a given.
I simply plug it into the wall,

445
00:29:18 --> 00:29:24
and so my driving voltage is
110 times the square

446
00:29:23 --> 00:29:29
root of 2, times the cosine of
omega T, and it is this omega.

447
00:29:28 --> 00:29:34
So it's the 110 volts
that comes out of

448
00:29:33 --> 00:29:39
the wall, so to speak.
My light bulb R is 60 ohms

449
00:29:38 --> 00:29:44
when it is hot,
and it is a 200 watt

450
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
bulb.
So if it's bright,

451
00:29:46 --> 00:29:52
200 watt bulb.
The self-inductance L is 0.1

452
00:29:52 --> 00:29:58
Henry,
and the capacitance is 8

453
00:29:57 --> 00:30:03
microfarads.
So this is God-given.

454
00:30:01 --> 00:30:07
With these three values,
I can calculate what Z is,

455
00:30:08 --> 00:30:14
and Z is 300 ohms.
In case you're interested,

456
00:30:13 --> 00:30:19
I can also give you omega L,
that is 38 ohms,

457
00:30:18 --> 00:30:24
and I can give you one over
omega C, that is

458
00:30:23 --> 00:30:29
ohms.
So notice that this is,

459
00:30:28 --> 00:30:34
by far, the dominant player in
the game, compared to omega L.

460
00:30:33 --> 00:30:39
In case you're interested in
the resonance frequency,

461
00:30:39 --> 00:30:45
omega 0 is one over the
square root of L C,

462
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
and that is about 1120 radians per

463
00:30:49 --> 00:30:55
second.
In other words,

464
00:30:51 --> 00:30:57
my driver is nowhere near
resonance.

465
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
I am way below resonance.
When you're way below

466
00:30:59 --> 00:31:05
resonance, it is the C that
dominates.

467
00:31:02 --> 00:31:08
Look at the 332 ohms,

468
00:31:06 --> 00:31:12
and compare that with the
38.

469
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
I can calculate,
now, what the maximum current

470
00:31:16 --> 00:31:22
is, that we get,
I Max.

471
00:31:18 --> 00:31:24
That is V0,
divided by Z,

472
00:31:21 --> 00:31:27
that impedance,
so that is

473
00:31:25 --> 00:31:31
square root 2,
divided by 300 ohms,

474
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
and that is 0.5
amperes.

475
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
And now I can tell you how much
power is dissipated in the light

476
00:31:39 --> 00:31:45
bulb, which is I square R.
So in the light bulb,

477
00:31:44 --> 00:31:50
which is the only component
which has a resistance -- well,

478
00:31:49 --> 00:31:55
maybe the L has,
also, a little bit of

479
00:31:52 --> 00:31:58
resistance, but we will ignore
that for now -- so in the light

480
00:31:56 --> 00:32:02
bulb, the average power over one
full cycle of my oscillations

481
00:32:01 --> 00:32:07
equals the mean value between I
squared R, time averaged,

482
00:32:06 --> 00:32:12
the time average value of
cosine omega T squared is always

483
00:32:10 --> 00:32:16
one-half, so this one-half that
comes here is the result of the

484
00:32:15 --> 00:32:21
fact that the I
there has a cosine omega T,

485
00:32:20 --> 00:32:26
and you square that,
you get one half,

486
00:32:23 --> 00:32:29
if you average it over
oscillations,

487
00:32:26 --> 00:32:32
so now I get I Max squared
times R.

488
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
So this is one-half times my 0.5 squared,

489
00:32:34 --> 00:32:40
and the R of the light bulb is
60, and this turns out to be

490
00:32:40 --> 00:32:46
7.5 watts.
Nothing.

491
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
Why is it nothing?
Well, that's the way we

492
00:32:46 --> 00:32:52
designed
this system.

493
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
We're way below resonance.
So if I plug the system in,

494
00:32:54 --> 00:33:00
which I will do for you,
this 200 watt light

495
00:32:59 --> 00:33:05
bulb will only dissipate 7.5 watts,

496
00:33:03 --> 00:33:09
and you won't see anything.
You ready for this?

497
00:33:07 --> 00:33:13
Three, two, one,
zero.

498
00:33:09 --> 00:33:15
Physics works.
You see nothing.

499
00:33:12 --> 00:33:18
Light bulb, not working.
Great.

500
00:33:14 --> 00:33:20
So now comes the question,
what could we do

501
00:33:19 --> 00:33:25
to get the system back on
resonance?

502
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
Well, we know that our driving
frequency is

503
00:33:31 --> 00:33:37
radians per
second.

504
00:33:34 --> 00:33:40
And so what we could do,
we could change the C in the

505
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
circuit, and we could change L
in the circuit.

506
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
If we increase C,
or we increase L,

507
00:33:51 --> 00:33:57
then the resonance frequency
will shift from 

508
00:33:57 --> 00:34:03
down, make L larger,
or make C larger,

509
00:34:01 --> 00:34:07
then, obviously,
you shift your resonance

510
00:34:05 --> 00:34:11
frequency down.
And my goal is to shift it down

511
00:34:10 --> 00:34:16
to 377 radians per second.

512
00:34:16 --> 00:34:22
I first want to make a curve
for you here,

513
00:34:21 --> 00:34:27
very roughly,
of I Max as a function of

514
00:34:26 --> 00:34:32
frequency, omega,
and that's the de-

515
00:34:30 --> 00:34:36
demonstration I just did.
When this was 1120,

516
00:34:36 --> 00:34:42
we had about 0.5 amperes at R value of

517
00:34:43 --> 00:34:49
377.
So this is one point of our I Max

518
00:34:50 --> 00:34:56
versus omega curve.
I can now ask the question,

519
00:34:56 --> 00:35:02
if we drive the system at
resonance, what then,

520
00:35:01 --> 00:35:07
would have been the maximum
current?

521
00:35:04 --> 00:35:10
We're not driving it at
resonance.

522
00:35:07 --> 00:35:13
But suppose we had driven it at
resonance.

523
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
Well, at resonance -- so at
resonance, I Max is V0

524
00:35:15 --> 00:35:21
divided by R.
There is no resi- there is no

525
00:35:19 --> 00:35:25
self-inductor,
and there is no capacitance at

526
00:35:24 --> 00:35:30
resonance.
And so that would then be

527
00:35:27 --> 00:35:33
110,
square root of 2,

528
00:35:29 --> 00:35:35
divided by 60.
But that is 2.6

529
00:35:33 --> 00:35:39
amperes.
That is substantially larger

530
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
than one-half.
So this value here is 

531
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
2.6 amperes.
It is too bad that I can't go

532
00:35:42 --> 00:35:48
there, because I am stuck to my
377,

533
00:35:47 --> 00:35:53
and I'm not going to change
that.

534
00:35:49 --> 00:35:55
Throughout the demonstration,
I stick to my driver here.

535
00:35:55 --> 00:36:01
So keep in mind that the driver
is always here,

536
00:35:59 --> 00:36:05
I don't change that.
So the resonance curve -- we

537
00:36:02 --> 00:36:08
call this the resonance curve --
is very broad,

538
00:36:06 --> 00:36:12
something like this.
And I believe the Q is around

539
00:36:10 --> 00:36:16
2, you can check that for
yourself.

540
00:36:13 --> 00:36:19
I can calculate what the power
is, that the  bulb is

541
00:36:17 --> 00:36:23
dissipating at resonance.
Well, that is my one-half,

542
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
which is the time-average
cosine squared --

543
00:36:26 --> 00:36:32
my I Max is now point -- 2.6 amperes,

544
00:36:29 --> 00:36:35
so now I get 2.6
squared -- and my resistance is

545
00:36:33 --> 00:36:39
still 60 ohms -- and this is
200 watts.

546
00:36:37 --> 00:36:43
What a coincidence,
that's the way we designed the

547
00:36:41 --> 00:36:47
experiment.
So if we could be at resonance,

548
00:36:44 --> 00:36:50
the light bulb would be happy
like a clam at high tide,

549
00:36:48 --> 00:36:54
it's exactly 200 watts.
It wants 2.6 amperes,

550
00:36:53 --> 00:36:59
that's what it wants.
Then it is a

551
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
200 watt light bulb.
And so we want to make the

552
00:37:01 --> 00:37:07
light bulb happy.
And how can we do that?

553
00:37:04 --> 00:37:10
Well, we can either increase L,
or we can increase C.

554
00:37:08 --> 00:37:14
And I want to catch two birds
with one stone during this

555
00:37:12 --> 00:37:18
demonstration,
I'm going to teach you a way

556
00:37:16 --> 00:37:22
that you can increase L,
something that we have never

557
00:37:20 --> 00:37:26
discussed before.
I have here,

558
00:37:22 --> 00:37:28
ferromagnetic material,
which has a value for kappa

559
00:37:26 --> 00:37:32
somewhere around 10,
12 -- let's say it is 10

560
00:37:32 --> 00:37:38
for now -- so that means that if
I bring that iron core inside,

561
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
that I could make this go up to
1 henry.

562
00:37:41 --> 00:37:47
Because remember,
the meaning of self-inductance

563
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
is the flux divided by the
current in the solenoid.

564
00:37:49 --> 00:37:55
And so if you bring in
ferromagnetic material with a

565
00:37:53 --> 00:37:59
kappa M of 10,
then the flux goes up by a

566
00:37:57 --> 00:38:03
factor of 10.
The current remains the same,

567
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
and therefore your
self-inductance goes up by a

568
00:38:04 --> 00:38:10
factor of 10.
So you see that you can make a

569
00:38:07 --> 00:38:13
variable self-inductance by
bringing in ferromagnetic

570
00:38:11 --> 00:38:17
material, and by removing it
again.

571
00:38:13 --> 00:38:19
And so the question,
now, is, how high should L be

572
00:38:17 --> 00:38:23
to get on resonance?
Well, that's very easy,

573
00:38:20 --> 00:38:26
because we know that one over
the square root of LC,

574
00:38:23 --> 00:38:29
we want to make that 377,

575
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
that's our driver.
But we know that

576
00:38:30 --> 00:38:36
C is 8 microfarads,
that's a God-given,

577
00:38:33 --> 00:38:39
we're not going to change that.
And so you can easily show now

578
00:38:37 --> 00:38:43
that if only we could make L 0.88 Henry,

579
00:38:41 --> 00:38:47
we should be back on resonance.
Then we have

580
00:38:45 --> 00:38:51
radians per second
as our resonance.

581
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
And you shouldn't be surprised
that omega L is then

582
00:38:52 --> 00:38:58
332 ohms.
Of course it is 

583
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
332 ohms,
because it's going to

584
00:39:00 --> 00:39:06
eat up that 1 / omega C,
they're going to cancel each

585
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
other.
That's another way you could

586
00:39:06 --> 00:39:12
have calculated the value of L,
by simply saying omega L has to

587
00:39:10 --> 00:39:16
be 332.
So there are various ways to

588
00:39:14 --> 00:39:20
get your resonance frequency.
And so what I have done,

589
00:39:18 --> 00:39:24
if I make L 0.88 Henry, I shift the

590
00:39:21 --> 00:39:27
resonance frequency to this
value, and my resonance curve

591
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
now will look like this.
But this height is going to be

592
00:39:29 --> 00:39:35
the same, because the height is
only

593
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
determined by V0 and R.
And so what I'm going to do now

594
00:39:36 --> 00:39:42
is I'm going to turn on the
instrument where it was before,

595
00:39:40 --> 00:39:46
when this was the
resonance curve,

596
00:39:43 --> 00:39:49
you won't see any light.
And I'm going to move the bar

597
00:39:47 --> 00:39:53
in, I probably don't have to
move it in all the way,

598
00:39:51 --> 00:39:57
and then the light bulb will go
through resonance,

599
00:39:54 --> 00:40:00
the system will go through
resonance, you will get your 

600
00:39:58 --> 00:40:04
2.6 amperes,
and the light bulb will be

601
00:40:01 --> 00:40:07
happy.
And so let's do that now.

602
00:40:03 --> 00:40:09
All right?
So here, system is now --

603
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
current is going.
60 Hertz,

604
00:40:09 --> 00:40:15
110 volts.
root mean square as we

605
00:40:13 --> 00:40:19
call that, and it's way off
resonance, 7.5

606
00:40:18 --> 00:40:24
watts, the light bulb doesn't
even feel warm.

607
00:40:22 --> 00:40:28
And now I bring the -- this
enormous piece of iron in there,

608
00:40:27 --> 00:40:33
and when I shove it in,
the self-inductance will slowly

609
00:40:31 --> 00:40:37
go up, the resonance frequency
will shift, and the current

610
00:40:36 --> 00:40:42
through the system will
increase.

611
00:40:40 --> 00:40:46
And there we go.
.

612
00:40:41 --> 00:40:47
There it is.
I'm on resonance now.

613
00:40:44 --> 00:40:50
So the light bulb is quite
happy.

614
00:40:46 --> 00:40:52
I want to do one more thing.
I'm going to double the

615
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
capacitance.
And what happens when I double

616
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59
the capacitance?
The frequency,

617
00:40:55 --> 00:41:01
the resonance frequency goes
further down that it was

618
00:40:59 --> 00:41:05
already, because remember,
when you increase L or C,

619
00:41:02 --> 00:41:08
the resonance frequency goes
down.

620
00:41:05 --> 00:41:11
So I'm going to double the
capacitance.

621
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
So that curve that you see on
the

622
00:41:12 --> 00:41:18
left there, has shifted,
now, even further to the left.

623
00:41:16 --> 00:41:22
And the light bulb is not very
happy.

624
00:41:19 --> 00:41:25
The light bulb is -- the system
is off resonance again.

625
00:41:23 --> 00:41:29
But if I increase C -- I
doubled it -- I can decrease L

626
00:41:27 --> 00:41:33
by a factor of 2,
all I have to do is pull the

627
00:41:31 --> 00:41:37
iron slowly out.
And then the resonance

628
00:41:33 --> 00:41:39
frequency comes back at

629
00:41:38 --> 00:41:44
radians per second.
Watch it.

630
00:41:40 --> 00:41:46
Back on resonance.
Amazing, isn't it?

631
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
Physics works.
So I showed you this

632
00:41:46 --> 00:41:52
demonstration,
and I spent so much time on it

633
00:41:48 --> 00:41:54
because I wanted you to be able
to appreciate -- I want you to

634
00:41:52 --> 00:41:58
be able to see through these
equations.

635
00:41:54 --> 00:42:00
The answer, in physics,
in general, lies in the

636
00:41:57 --> 00:42:03
equations, but it only works if
you build up a certain amount of

637
00:42:01 --> 00:42:07
understanding.
And that is not always easy,

638
00:42:03 --> 00:42:09
and the demonstrations help
that.

639
00:42:05 --> 00:42:11
Seeing is believing.
And you may have to go over

640
00:42:08 --> 00:42:14
this at home in order to digest
it a little bit.

641
00:42:11 --> 00:42:17
I don't expect you to get all
this just in one lecture,

642
00:42:16 --> 00:42:22
of course not.
We have a new impedance here,

643
00:42:19 --> 00:42:25
we have the reactance here,
we have the idea that omega L

644
00:42:23 --> 00:42:29
eats up omega C,
then we get into resonance,

645
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
all these phenomenon take time
to digest.

646
00:42:29 --> 00:42:35
There are many key practical
applications in LRC circuits,

647
00:42:33 --> 00:42:39
more than you may think.
Your radio and your TV are

648
00:42:37 --> 00:42:43
systems that you,
without realizing it,

649
00:42:40 --> 00:42:46
you tune them to resonance.
There's an antenna,

650
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
and that receives many,
many stations at all different

651
00:42:48 --> 00:42:54
frequencies, and you are
changing -- in general,

652
00:42:51 --> 00:42:57
you change the capacitor.
And when you change the

653
00:42:54 --> 00:43:00
capacitor in the LRC circuit,
you are changing the resonance

654
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03
frequency, and at that resonance
frequency, the system is very

655
00:43:01 --> 00:43:07
sensitive, drives a very high
current, and it selects,

656
00:43:05 --> 00:43:11
then, a particular station at
that frequency.

657
00:43:07 --> 00:43:13
That's what you're doing with
your TV, and that's what you're

658
00:43:11 --> 00:43:17
doing with your radio.
You're changing a variable

659
00:43:14 --> 00:43:20
capacitor.
Another application which is

660
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
quite
common are metal detectors.

661
00:43:20 --> 00:43:26
Metal detectors are resonant
circuits, they are set at

662
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
resonance, and then,
when you bring metal nearby,

663
00:43:30 --> 00:43:36
you bring them off resonance,
and then the alarm goes.

664
00:43:35 --> 00:43:41
In general, they have two coils
-- this is one coil,

665
00:43:39 --> 00:43:45
and this is another coil.
Inductance L1,

666
00:43:43 --> 00:43:49
resistor R1,
capacitance C1,

667
00:43:46 --> 00:43:52
L2, R2,
C2.

668
00:43:49 --> 00:43:55
And so there's a current,

669
00:43:51 --> 00:43:57
I1, running through this
one, a current I2 running

670
00:43:55 --> 00:44:01
through that one.
To set up the differential

671
00:43:59 --> 00:44:05
equations for this system is not
so easy.

672
00:44:02 --> 00:44:08
You get two differential
equations, of course,

673
00:44:05 --> 00:44:11
one for this system,
and one for this system.

674
00:44:09 --> 00:44:15
The problem -- but at the same
time the trick -- is that there

675
00:44:13 --> 00:44:19
is a mutual inductance between
the two, because when this one

676
00:44:18 --> 00:44:24
produces a current I2,
there is a magnetic flux going

677
00:44:23 --> 00:44:29
through this one.
That's why we call it mutual

678
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
inductance, which we have never
really dealt with in any detail

679
00:44:30 --> 00:44:36
in 8.02,
and we won't.

680
00:44:32 --> 00:44:38
But I want to mention that this
differential equation here is an

681
00:44:36 --> 00:44:42
equation in I1,
L1, R1,

682
00:44:38 --> 00:44:44
C1, but also contains a term
N times dI2/dt.

683
00:44:42 --> 00:44:48
And this differential equation
is an equation in L2,

684
00:44:45 --> 00:44:51
R2, C2,
I2, but also contains a

685
00:44:48 --> 00:44:54
term, N times dI1/dt.
And so now you get two coupled

686
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
differential equations.
It's not just one in I1,

687
00:44:56 --> 00:45:02
and one in I2.
It is one in I1 and I2,

688
00:44:59 --> 00:45:05
and it is another one in I1
and I2.

689
00:45:02 --> 00:45:08
And that is a pain in the neck,
and it's not easy to solve.

690
00:45:05 --> 00:45:11
But there are mathematicians
who can do all that,

691
00:45:08 --> 00:45:14
and they solved that for us
physicists.

692
00:45:10 --> 00:45:16
In any case,
what is important that clearly,

693
00:45:13 --> 00:45:19
since you have two coils,
you get two resonance

694
00:45:16 --> 00:45:22
frequencies, not just one,
but you have two resonance

695
00:45:19 --> 00:45:25
frequencies.
And at least one of those

696
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
resonance
frequencies depends very

697
00:45:25 --> 00:45:31
strongly on the mutual
inductance.

698
00:45:27 --> 00:45:33
And so the system is tuned to
set at one of these two

699
00:45:30 --> 00:45:36
resonance frequencies.
And now someone brings in

700
00:45:33 --> 00:45:39
metal.
You bring in a chu- chunk of

701
00:45:36 --> 00:45:42
metal.
And in this metal -- the metal

702
00:45:38 --> 00:45:44
will experience the magnetic
field, flux changes,

703
00:45:41 --> 00:45:47
AC of course,
always, in the metal,

704
00:45:44 --> 00:45:50
it will start building up eddy
currents.

705
00:45:46 --> 00:45:52
And so the eddy currents will
change the magnetic coupling

706
00:45:50 --> 00:45:56
between these two loops.
And so M changes.

707
00:45:55 --> 00:46:01
And when M changes,
you go off resonance,

708
00:45:58 --> 00:46:04
and bingo, your alarm goes off.
Clearly, and very

709
00:46:01 --> 00:46:07
unfortunately,
this never works for plastic

710
00:46:04 --> 00:46:10
bombs.
You must have conducting

711
00:46:06 --> 00:46:12
material that you bring in,
so it must be a metal.

712
00:46:10 --> 00:46:16
These systems have very high Q,
very high Q means they are

713
00:46:14 --> 00:46:20
extremely sensitive.
If you have very high Q,

714
00:46:17 --> 00:46:23
that curve is extremely narrow,
and so the slightest change in

715
00:46:22 --> 00:46:28
M, you go off resonance,
and you get

716
00:46:26 --> 00:46:32
your alarm.
And so they come in various

717
00:46:29 --> 00:46:35
forms, and in various
applications.

718
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
At the airport,
it is very simple.

719
00:46:33 --> 00:46:39
You walk through these two
coils.

720
00:46:36 --> 00:46:42
You may not have realized that,
but you simply walk through.

721
00:46:40 --> 00:46:46
You walk through,
like, there's one coil here,

722
00:46:43 --> 00:46:49
one coil there,
and that's how they detect

723
00:46:46 --> 00:46:52
whether you have any,
uh, metal on you.

724
00:46:49 --> 00:46:55
The one -- the metal detectors
that are used to search your

725
00:46:53 --> 00:46:59
body, including the ones that
are used to

726
00:46:57 --> 00:47:03
search the ground for coins --
uh, when I was a kid,

727
00:47:01 --> 00:47:07
I went often to the beach in
the Netherlands,

728
00:47:04 --> 00:47:10
and there were often people who
were having these metal

729
00:47:08 --> 00:47:14
detectors, they were looking for
coins.

730
00:47:11 --> 00:47:17
And those metal detectors,
basically the same idea,

731
00:47:14 --> 00:47:20
always two coils -- this is
this coil, and this is this

732
00:47:18 --> 00:47:24
coil, and when metal comes
nearby, you have a system that

733
00:47:22 --> 00:47:28
goes off resonance,
you get a difference --

734
00:47:25 --> 00:47:31
magnetic coupling between the
two

735
00:47:29 --> 00:47:35
coils, and the system goes into
alarm.

736
00:47:32 --> 00:47:38
And I'd like to demonstrate
that, for wh- for which I need a

737
00:47:36 --> 00:47:42
student.
Any student who wants to

738
00:47:38 --> 00:47:44
volunteer, I have here a metal
detector, and,

739
00:47:41 --> 00:47:47
thank goodness,
we don't have to go through

740
00:47:44 --> 00:47:50
metal detectors yet,
at MIT -- you want to

741
00:47:47 --> 00:47:53
volunteer?
Boy, you're brave,

742
00:47:49 --> 00:47:55
you're all the way at the end
of the -- can't wait what you

743
00:47:53 --> 00:47:59
have in store for us.
Oh, you look like you're made

744
00:47:57 --> 00:48:03
of steel.
OK, you -- I hope you left all

745
00:48:00 --> 00:48:06
your
secret weapons up there,

746
00:48:04 --> 00:48:10
did you?
[unintelligible].

747
00:48:07 --> 00:48:13
So this is a -- this is a metal
detector, and if you opened this

748
00:48:14 --> 00:48:20
up here, you would see two
coils, one in the center,

749
00:48:20 --> 00:48:26
and one near the edge.
[beep].

750
00:48:23 --> 00:48:29
And we have to -- I have to
calibrate it first -- OK.

751
00:48:28 --> 00:48:34
Oh, you left your cigarettes
out there?

752
00:48:33 --> 00:48:39
They -- they won't record.  What did you leave out there?  I am just getting curious.  Oh, you're afraid they will get damaged?  Oh, we hear nothing.  That's nice.  
Student: Definitely not

753
00:48:41 --> 00:48:47
working.
No, that's probably not

754
00:48:44 --> 00:48:50
working.
Well, just a second,

755
00:48:47 --> 00:48:53
may have to recalibrate this.
.

756
00:48:50 --> 00:48:56
Pretty quiet.
Doesn't look like you have any

757
00:48:55 --> 00:49:01
metal there.
I'm pr- fairly sure I turned it

758
00:49:00 --> 00:49:06
on.
They don't always work,

759
00:49:03 --> 00:49:09
do they?
Marcos, you have any

760
00:49:06 --> 00:49:12
wisdom on that?
[beep] Uh-uh.

761
00:49:11 --> 00:49:17
It's working.
No, it's not working very well.

762
00:49:16 --> 00:49:22
It's working well here.
[laughter].

763
00:49:19 --> 00:49:25
Wonder what you got there.
Are you metal -- is this not

764
00:49:25 --> 00:49:31
made of metal,
all these things in here?

765
00:49:29 --> 00:49:35
Student: I have lots of metal
on me, and [unintelligible] I'm

766
00:49:35 --> 00:49:41
surprised it's only going off at
the belt buckle,

767
00:49:40 --> 00:49:46
it's weird.
Oh, you may be a weird person,

768
00:49:44 --> 00:49:50
that may be [laughter].
[beeping].

769
00:49:49 --> 00:49:55
Can you turn around?
Oh, that's your watch.

770
00:49:53 --> 00:49:59
[beeping].
[laughter].

771
00:49:55 --> 00:50:01
You'd better turn around again.
Ah, there are the keys.

772
00:50:01 --> 00:50:07
