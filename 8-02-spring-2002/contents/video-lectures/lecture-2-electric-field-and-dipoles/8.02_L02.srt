00:00:00 --> 00:00:03,993



2
00:00:03,993 --> 00:00:11,767
Today I'm going to work with
you on a new concept and that is

3
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:17,209
the concept of what we call
electric field.

4
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:23,04
We spend the whole lecture on
electric fields.

5
00:00:23,04 --> 00:00:28,223
If I have a -- a charge,
I just choose Q,

6
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:34,572
capital Q and plus at a
particular location and at

7
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:40,802
another location
I have another charge little Q,

8
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:43,709
I think of that as my test
charge.

9
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:48,29
And there is a separation
between the two which is R.

10
00:00:48,29 --> 00:00:53,664
The unit vector from capital Q
to li- little Q is this vector.

11
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:59,126
And so now I know that the two
charges if they were positive --

12
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:04,5
let's suppose that little Q is
positive, they would repel each

13
00:01:04,5 --> 00:01:07,759
other.
Little Q is negative they would

14
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,219
attract each other.
And let this force be F and

15
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:18,323
last time we introduced
Coulomb's law that force equals

16
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:24,09
little Q times capital Q times
Coulomb's constant divided by R

17
00:01:24,09 --> 00:01:27,304
squared in the direction of R
roof.

18
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:32,03
The two have the same sign.
It's in this direction.

19
00:01:32,03 --> 00:01:37,135
If they have opposite sign it's
in the other direction.

20
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:42,617
And now I introduce the idea of
electric field for which we

21
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:46,389
write
the symbol capital E.

22
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:51,941
And capital E at that location
P where I have my test charge

23
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:57,398
little Q at that location P is
simply the force that a test

24
00:01:57,398 --> 00:02:01,726
charge experienced divided by
that test charge.

25
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:07,372
So I eliminate the test charge.
So I get something that looks

26
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:13,017
quite similar but it doesn't
have the little Q in it anymore.

27
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:18,193
And it is also a vector.
And by convention,

28
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:22,801
we choose the force such that
if this is a positive test

29
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:27,997
charge then we say the E field
is away from Q if Q is positive,

30
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:32,354
if Q is negative the force is
in the other direction,

31
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:35,789
and therefore E is in the other
direction.

32
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,733
So we adopt the convention that
the E field is always in the

33
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:45,175
direction that the force is on a
positive test charge.

34
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:49,281
What you have gained now is
that you

35
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:53,67
have taken out the little Q.
In other words the force here

36
00:02:53,67 --> 00:02:57,058
depends on little Q.
Electric field does not.

37
00:02:57,058 --> 00:03:01,217
The electric field is a
representation for what happens

38
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:04,682
around the charge plus Q.
This could be a very

39
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:07,146
complicated charge
configuration.

40
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:11,304
An electric field tells you
something about that charge

41
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:14,77
configuration.
The unit for electric field you

42
00:03:14,77 --> 00:03:17,696
can see is newtons divided by
coulombs.

43
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:22,085
In SI units and normally we
won't even indicate the um the

44
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:26,909
unit,
we just leave that as it is.

45
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:32,54
Now we have graphical
representations for the electric

46
00:03:32,54 --> 00:03:36,047
field.
Electric field is a vector.

47
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:42,741
So you expect arrows and I have
here an example of a -- a charge

48
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:47,204
plus three.
So by convention the arrows are

49
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:53,26
pointing away from the charge in
the same direction that a

50
00:03:53,26 --> 00:03:57,751
positive test
charge would experience the

51
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,197
force.
And you notice that very close

52
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,799
to the charge the arrows are
larger than farther away.

53
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,672
That it that sort of represents
is trying to represent the

54
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:11,545
inverse R square relationship.
Of course it cannot be very

55
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:14,399
quantitative.
But the basic idea is this is

56
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:18,34
of course spherically symmetric,
if this is a point charge.

57
00:04:18,34 --> 00:04:22,078
The basic idea is here you see
the field vectors and the

58
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:26,155
direction of the arrow tells you
in which direction the force

59
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,613
would be.
If it is a positive test

60
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:31,981
charge.
And the length of the vector

61
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,214
give you an idea of the
magnitude.

62
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:36,92
And here I have another charge
minus one.

63
00:04:36,92 --> 00:04:40,574
Doesn't matter whether it is
minus one coulomb or minus

64
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,807
microcoulomb.
Just it's a relative

65
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:45,581
representation.
And you see now that the E

66
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,219
field vectors are reversed in
direction.

67
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:51,941
They're pointing towards the
minus charge by convention.

68
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:55,932
And when you go further out
they are smaller and you have to

69
00:04:55,932 --> 00:05:00,159
go all
the way to infinity of course

70
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:05,095
for the field to become zero.
Because the one over R square

71
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:10,286
field falls off and you have to
be infinitely far away for you

72
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:15,222
to not experience at least in
principle any effect from the

73
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:19,137
from the charge.
What do we do now when we have

74
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:22,966
more than one charge?
Well, if we have several

75
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:28,072
charges -- here we have Q one
and here we have Q two and here

76
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:32,413
we have Q three and let's say
here we

77
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:35,386
have Q of I,
we have I charges.

78
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:41,431
And now we want to know what is
the electric field at point P.

79
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:46,783
So it's independent of the test
charge that I put here.

80
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:52,63
You can think of it if you want
to as the the force per unit

81
00:05:52,63 --> 00:05:56,297
charge.
You've divided out the charge.

82
00:05:56,297 --> 00:06:01,748
So now I can say what is the E
field due to Q one alone?

83
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:06,307
Well, that would be if Q one
were

84
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:11,517
positive then this might be a
representation for E one.

85
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:16,631
If Q two were negative,
this might be a representation

86
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:21,166
for E two, pointing towards the
negative charge.

87
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:26,376
And if this one were negative,
then I would have here a

88
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:29,368
contribution E three,
and so on.

89
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:33,903
And now we use the
superposition principle as we

90
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:39,209
did last time with Coulomb's
law, that the

91
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:44,789
net electric field at point P
as a vector is E one in

92
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:51,119
reference of charge Q one plus
the vector E two plus E three

93
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:57,234
and so on and if you have I
charges it is the sum of all I

94
00:06:57,234 --> 00:07:00,989
charges of the individual E
vectors.

95
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:06,568
Is it obvious that the
superposition principle works?

96
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:08,285
No.
Does it work?

97
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:11,182
Yes.
How do we

98
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:14,579
know it works?
Because it's consistent with

99
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:19,189
all our experimental results.
So we take the superposition

100
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,748
principle for granted and that
is acceptable.

101
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:26,307
But it's not obvious.
If you tell me what the

102
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:31,16
electric field at this point is
which is the vectorial sum of

103
00:07:31,16 --> 00:07:36,094
the individual E field vectors
then I can always tell you what

104
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:41,595
the force will be if I bring a
charge at that location.

105
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:45,37
I take any charge that I always
would carry in my pocket,

106
00:07:45,37 --> 00:07:49,145
I take it out of my pocket and
I put it at that location.

107
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:52,584
And the charge that I have in
my pocket is little Q.

108
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:55,887
Then the force on that charge
is always Q times E.

109
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:58,314
Doesn't matter whether Q is
positive.

110
00:07:58,314 --> 00:08:01,146
Then it will be in the same
direction as E.

111
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:05,123
If it is negative it will be in
the opposite direction as E.

112
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:07,618
If Q is large the force will be
large.

113
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:10,112
If Q is small the force will be
small.

114
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:15,834
So once you know the E
field it could be the result of

115
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:19,46
very complicated charge
configurations,

116
00:08:19,46 --> 00:08:24,707
the real secret behind the
concept of an E field is that

117
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:30,432
you bring any charge at that
location and you know what force

118
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:33,581
acts at that point on that
charge.

119
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:37,97
If we try to be a little bit
more quantitative,

120
00:08:37,97 --> 00:08:43,122
suppose I had here a charge
plus three and here I had a

121
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:47,457
charge minus one.
Here's minus one.

122
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:51,832
And I want to know what the
field configuration is as a

123
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:56,611
result of these two charges.
So you can go to any particular

124
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,366
point.
You get an E vector which is

125
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:04,308
going away from the plus three,
you get one that goes to minus

126
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:07,872
one, and you have to vectorially
add the two.

127
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:12,814
If you are very close to minus
one, it's very clear because of

128
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:16,946
the inverse R square
relationship that the minus one

129
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:20,141
is probably
going to win.

130
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:23,629
Let's in our mind take a plus
test charge now.

131
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,737
And we put a plus test charge
very close to minus one,

132
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:30,915
say put it here,
even though plus three is

133
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:34,558
trying to push it out,
clearly minus one is most

134
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:38,046
likely to win.
And so there will probably be a

135
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:41,223
force on my test charge in this
direction.

136
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:44,324
The net result of the effects
of the two.

137
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:48,432
Suppose I take the same
positive test charge and I put

138
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:54,133
it here, very far away,
much farther away than this

139
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,778
separation.
What do you think now is the

140
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:01,517
direction of the force on my
plus charge?

141
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,76
Very far away.
Excuse me.

142
00:10:03,76 --> 00:10:06,845
Why do you think it's to the
left?

143
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:10,864
Do you think minus one wins?
A: [inaudible].

144
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:16,285
Do you really think the minus
one is stronger than the plus

145
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:22,173
three because the plus three
will push it out and

146
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:48,551
the minus one tries to lure it
in, right, if the test charge is

147
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:54,508
positive.
A:

148
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,732
plus two.
So if you're far away from a

149
00:10:56,732 --> 00:10:59,498
configuration like this,
even if you were here,

150
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:02,143
or if you were there,
or if you're way there,

151
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:04,728
clearly the field is like a
plus two charge.

152
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,832
And falls off as one over R
squared.

153
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,56
So therefore if you're far away
the force is in this direction.

154
00:11:10,56 --> 00:11:12,845
And now look,
what is very interesting.

155
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:16,332
Here if you're close to the
minus one, the force is in this

156
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,797
direction.
Here when you're very far away,

157
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:22,284
maybe I should be all the way
here, it's in that direction.

158
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:26,072
So that means there must be
somewhere here

159
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:28,987
the point where the E field is
zero.

160
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:33,985
Because if the force is here in
this direction but ultimately

161
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:38,984
turns over in that direction,
there must be somewhere a point

162
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:42,316
where E is zero.
And that is part of your

163
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:45,648
assignment.
I want you to find that point

164
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:48,73
for a particular charge
configuration.

165
00:11:48,73 --> 00:11:53,145
So let's now go to some
graphical representations of a

166
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:58,476
situation which is actually plus
three minus one,

167
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:02,215
try to improve on the light
situation.

168
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:06,256
And let's see how these
electric vectors,

169
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:11,61
how they show up in the
vicinity of these two charges.

170
00:12:11,61 --> 00:12:16,46
So here you see the plus three
and the minus one,

171
00:12:16,46 --> 00:12:20,905
relative units,
and let's take a look at this

172
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:25,451
in some detail.
First of all the length of the

173
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:30,402
arrows again indicates the
strength.

174
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:32,828
It gives you a feeling for the
strength.

175
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:35,068
It's not very quantitative of
course.

176
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:38,49
And so let's first look at the
plus three, which is very

177
00:12:38,49 --> 00:12:40,855
powerful.
You see that these arrows all

178
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:44,65
go away from the plus three and
when you're closer to the plus

179
00:12:44,65 --> 00:12:47,886
three, they're stronger,
which is a representation of

180
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:51,246
the inverse R square field.
If you're very close to the

181
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:54,792
minus one, ah the arrows are
pointing in towards the minus

182
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,152
one, because the one over R
square, the minus one wins.

183
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:02,214
And so you see
they're clearly going into the

184
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:06,031
direction of the minus one.
Well, if you're in between the

185
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:09,915
plus and the minus on this line,
always the E field will be

186
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,258
pointing from the plus to the
minus.

187
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,209
Because the plus is pushing out
and the minus is sucking in.

188
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:20,293
So the two support each other.
But now if you go very far away

189
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:24,177
from this charge configuration,
anywhere but very far away,

190
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:27,793
much farther than the distance
between the two charges,

191
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:30,27
so somewhere here,
or somewhere there,

192
00:13:30,27 --> 00:13:34,629
or somewhere there,
or here, notice that always the

193
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:37,785
arrows are pointing away.
And the reason is that plus

194
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:41,305
three and minus one is as good
as a plus two if you're very

195
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,976
very far away.
But of course when you're very

196
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:47,253
close in, then the field
configuration can be very very

197
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:49,742
complicated.
But you see very clearly that

198
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:52,048
these arrows are all pointing
outwards.

199
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,415
None of them come back to the
minus one.

200
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:57,146
None of them point to the minus
one direction.

201
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,667
And that's because the plus
three is more powerful and then

202
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:04,821
there is here
this point and only point

203
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:10,072
whereby the electric field is
zero, if you put a positive test

204
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:15,064
charge here, the minus will
attract it, the plus will repel

205
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:20,4
it, and therefore there comes a
point where the two cancel each

206
00:14:20,4 --> 00:14:23,929
other exactly.
Now there is another way of

207
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:28,491
electric field representation
which is more organized.

208
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:33,741
And we call these field lines.
So you see again the plus three

209
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:37,816
and
you see there the minus one.

210
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:42,852
If I release right here or I
place here a positive test

211
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:48,447
charge all I know is that the
force will be tangential to the

212
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:52,178
field lines.
That is the meaning of these

213
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:55,442
lines.
So if I'm here the force will

214
00:14:55,442 --> 00:15:00,292
be in this direction.
If I put a positive test charge

215
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:06,726
here, the force will be in this
direction, and of course,

216
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:09,879
if it's a negative charge the
force flips over.

217
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,785
So the meaning of the field
lines are that it always tells

218
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:17,28
you in which direction a charge
experiences a force.

219
00:15:17,28 --> 00:15:21,049
A force a positive charge
always in the direction of the

220
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,681
arrows, tangentially to the
field lines and a negative

221
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,874
charge in the opposite
direction.

222
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:29,546
How many field lines are there
in space?

223
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:32,493
Well of course there are an
infinite number.

224
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,782
Just like these little arrows
that we had before,

225
00:15:35,782 --> 00:15:39,346
we only sprinkled in a few but
of

226
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:43,1
course in every single point
there is an electric field and

227
00:15:43,1 --> 00:15:46,919
so you can put in an infinite
number of field lines and that

228
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,155
would make this a representation
of course useless.

229
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:53,262
So we always limit ourselves to
a certain number.

230
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:57,017
If you look very close to the
minus one notice that all the

231
00:15:57,017 --> 00:15:59,347
field lines come in on the minus
one.

232
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:03,166
We understand that of course
because a positive charge would

233
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,726
want to go to the minus one.
If you're very close to the

234
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:10,61
plus and they all go away from
the plus because they're being

235
00:16:10,61 --> 00:16:14,571
repelled.
You can sort of think as these

236
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:18,581
field lines if you want to
imagine the configuration that

237
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:21,874
the plus charges blow out air
like a hairdryer,

238
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:25,598
and that the minus suck in air
like a vacuum cleaner,

239
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:29,966
and then you get a feeling for
there is on this left side here

240
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:34,334
this hairdryer which wants to
blow out stuff and then there is

241
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:38,344
that little sucker that wants to
suck something in and it

242
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:41,995
succeeds to some degree,
it's not as powerful as the

243
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:44,304
plus
three, though.

244
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,373
Have we lost all information
about field strength?

245
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,943
We had earlier with these
arrows, we had the length of the

246
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,013
arrow, the magnitude of the
field was represented.

247
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,019
Yeah, you have lost that,
but there is still some

248
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,339
information on field strength.
If the lines are closer

249
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:02,969
together, the density of the
lines is high,

250
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:06,664
the electric field is stronger
than when the density becomes

251
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:08,606
low.
So if you look for instance

252
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:12,051
here, look how many lines there
are per few millimeters,

253
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:15,371
and when you go further out
these

254
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:18,91
lines spread out,
that tells you the E field is

255
00:17:18,91 --> 00:17:22,987
going down, the strength of the
E field is going down.

256
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:26,219
It's the one over R square
field of course.

257
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:30,373
If you want to make these
drawings what you could do to

258
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:34,143
make them look good,
you can make three times more

259
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:38,914
field lines going out from the
plus in this case than return to

260
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:42,068
the minus one.
So the field lines are very

261
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:46,915
powerful and we will often think
in terms of electric fields and

262
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:51,377
the line configurations and you
will have

263
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:57,154
several homework problems that
deal with electric fields and

264
00:17:57,154 --> 00:18:02,833
with the electric field lines.
If an electric field line is

265
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:08,218
straight, so I have electric
fields, get some red chalk,

266
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:13,505
say we have fields that are
like this, straight E field

267
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:19,281
lines, and I release a charge
there, for instance a positive

268
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:22,829
charge,
then the positive charge would

269
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:26,401
experience a force exactly in
the same direction as the field

270
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:29,914
lines, because the tangential
now is in the direction of the

271
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:33,248
field line, it would become
accelerated in this direction

272
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:35,629
and would always stay on the
field lines.

273
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,903
If I release it with zero
speed, start to accelerate and

274
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:40,808
it would stay on the field
lines.

275
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:43,428
In a similar way,
if we think of the earth as

276
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:46,94
having a gravitational field,
with eight oh one we may never

277
00:18:46,94 --> 00:18:49,321
have used that word,
gravitational field,

278
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:53,36
but in physics
we think of the -- of gravity

279
00:18:53,36 --> 00:18:56,834
also being a field.
If I have here a piece of chalk

280
00:18:56,834 --> 00:19:00,516
the um the field lines,
the gravitational field lines,

281
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:04,614
here in twenty-six one hundred,
nicely parallel and straight

282
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:08,574
and if I release this piece of
chalk at zero speed it will

283
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:11,978
begin to move in the direction
of the field lines,

284
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,41
and it will stay on the field
lines.

285
00:19:14,41 --> 00:19:18,648
So now you can ask yourself the
question if I release a charge

286
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:22,469
would it always follow the field
lines?

287
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:26,732
And the answer is no.
Only in this very special case.

288
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,585
But suppose now that the field
lines are curved.

289
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:34,521
So here are field lines as you
have seen in those

290
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:37,145
configurations.
It's very common.

291
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:41,818
If now I release a -- a charge
in here, say I have a point

292
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:46,492
charge here, it will experience
a force in this direction.

293
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:50,427
So it will get an acceleration
in this direction,

294
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:54,527
so it will immediately abandon
that

295
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,153
field line.
And so if now you ask me what

296
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:59,648
is the trajectory of that
charge, well,

297
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,734
it could become very
complicated, I really don't

298
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,835
know.
Maybe it's going like this,

299
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:08,906
and by the time it reaches this
point, what I do know that then

300
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:11,992
the force will be tangential to
this field line,

301
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:15,734
so will be in this direction.
And so as it marches out and

302
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:18,426
picks up speed,
locally it will experience

303
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,841
forces representative of those
field lines and so the

304
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:25,518
trajectory can be rather
complicated.

305
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:28,624
So field lines are not
trajectories,

306
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:34,126
and not even when you release a
charge with uh with zero speed.

307
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:38,741
Only in case that the field
lines are straight lines.

308
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:43,357
Let's now look at a field
configuration which Maxwell

309
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:48,504
himself, the great maestro,
in some of his publications put

310
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:51,522
there.
And it's a ratio one to four

311
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:58
and whether it is plus four plus
one or minus four minus one

312
00:20:58 --> 00:21:02,139
is not important because that's
just a matter of the direction

313
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,785
of the arrows.
But uh Maxwell didn't put

314
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,092
arrows in.
So I leave it up to you.

315
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:11,026
If it's plus four and plus one
you have to put arrows going

316
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:13,537
outwards.
And what you see now here is

317
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:16,861
this airblower effect.
Think of them as both being

318
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:19,168
positive.
So there is the plus four

319
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:23,103
trying to blow air out like a
hairdryer and the plus one is

320
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:26,359
trying to do its own thing and
so you get a field

321
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,123
configuration,
field lines,

322
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:33,329
which are sort of not
perhaps easy but you can sort

323
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:36,661
of imagine why it has this
peculiar shape.

324
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:41,049
If you um put a plus test
charge in between the one and

325
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:45,762
the four, then the four will
repel it but the one will also

326
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:50,068
repel it and so there's going to
be a point somewhere,

327
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:54,294
probably close to one,
whereby the two forces exactly

328
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:57,706
cancel out.
Therefore E will be zero there.

329
00:21:57,706 --> 00:22:02,744
In a similar way between the
moon and the earth,

330
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:07,184
there is a point not too far
away from the moon where the

331
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:11,941
gravitational attraction from
the earth and the gravitational

332
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:16,223
attraction from the moon exactly
cancel each other out.

333
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:19,79
That's not too dissimilar from
this situation.

334
00:22:19,79 --> 00:22:23,358
So when you have charges of the
same polarity,

335
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:27,56
you always find in between
somewhere a point where the

336
00:22:27,56 --> 00:22:31,762
electric field is zero.
Let's now go to a very special

337
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:36,281
case whereby I make the two
charges equal in magnitude but

338
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:41,127
opposite in sign
and we have a name for that,

339
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:45,348
we call that a dipole.
The plus charge is here and the

340
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:48,852
minus charge is there.
Situation is extremely

341
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:53,709
symmetric, as you would expect,
because they have equal power.

342
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:57,85
There's one airblower upstairs
and one vacuum cleaner

343
00:22:57,85 --> 00:23:00,876
downstairs.
If you're close to the plus

344
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:05,654
charge notice that all the field
lines go away from the plus.

345
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:10,273
And if you're close to the
minus, notice that all the field

346
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:13,535
lines come
in on the minus,

347
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:16,887
you expect that.
If you are far away from this

348
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:21,431
dipole, now you have a problem.
Before we had a plus three and

349
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:25,602
a minus one and when you're far
away the plus three wins.

350
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:28,358
So it's like having a plus two
charge.

351
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:32,753
If you're far away you always
expect the electric field then

352
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:37,073
to be pointing away from the
equivalent charge of plus two.

353
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:40,872
But if you add up plus and
minus and they have equal

354
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:44,546
magnitude,
let's say plus one and minus

355
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:47,464
one, you get zero,
so neither one wins if you're

356
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:50,816
far away, and notice carefully
if you're very far away,

357
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:54,54
indeed you do not see arrows
either pointing out nor pointing

358
00:23:54,54 --> 00:23:56,029
in.
Nature cannot decide,

359
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:58,947
there isn't one that is
stronger than the other.

360
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:01,802
And that makes dipole fields
very very special.

361
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,719
In the case of the plus three
and the minus one,

362
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,885
if you're very far away,
it's like having a plus two

363
00:24:07,885 --> 00:24:11,733
charge and the E field when you
go further and further out will

364
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,939
fall off as one
over R squared.

365
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:18,934
With a dipole your intuition
sort of tells you that it will

366
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:22,24
probably fall off faster than
one over R squared.

367
00:24:22,24 --> 00:24:26,304
And that is part of a homework
assignment that you have this

368
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:28,715
week.
In fact I can already give you

369
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:30,919
the answer.
You have to prove it.

370
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,639
If you're far away from an
electric dipole the electric

371
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,05
field falls off as one over R
cubed.

372
00:24:37,05 --> 00:24:39,667
It goes faster than one over R
squared.

373
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:44,695
There is not a single point in
space where the electric

374
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:48,845
field is zero.
And you can think about that

375
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:53,786
why that is the case.
So these field configurations

376
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:59,813
can be rather complicated and
can be very interesting and each

377
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:05,445
one has its own applications.
Are dipoles rare in physics?

378
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:09,1
Not at all.
In fact, they're extremely

379
00:25:09,1 --> 00:25:11,966
common.
You cannot avoid them.

380
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:16,606
Remember last time,
I told you if you have a

381
00:25:16,606 --> 00:25:19,438
spherical atom or we have a
spherical molecule,

382
00:25:19,438 --> 00:25:23,133
and you bring that close to a
charge -- let's now think of it

383
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:26,397
you bring it in an electric
field, it's another way of

384
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:29,415
saying the same thing.
So we have a nice spherical

385
00:25:29,415 --> 00:25:32,741
atom or a nice spherical
molecule and we bring it in an

386
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,142
electric field.
The electrons want to go

387
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:38,53
upstream the electric field
vectors, they go against the

388
00:25:38,53 --> 00:25:42,286
direction of the electric field.
And the positive charge wants

389
00:25:42,286 --> 00:25:45,119
to go in the direction,
wants to go downstream.

390
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,321
And so what are you going to
do?

391
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:52,125
The electrons will spend a
little bit more time on one side

392
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:56,126
of the nucleus than they would
in the absence of that electric

393
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:58,421
field.
And therefore you are through

394
00:25:58,421 --> 00:26:01,7
induction turning that atom,
turning that molecule,

395
00:26:01,7 --> 00:26:04,98
in becoming a dipole.
If you have a little bit more

396
00:26:04,98 --> 00:26:07,537
charge on this side,
averaged over time,

397
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:11,275
you have the same amount of
extra charge plus on that side

398
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:14,489
averaged over time.
So you make dipoles very often

399
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:18,031
whether you like it or not.
And later in this course we

400
00:26:18,031 --> 00:26:21,965
will learn more about the
polarization of

401
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:26,67
atoms and molecules creating
dipoles when when we talk about

402
00:26:26,67 --> 00:26:29,939
dielectrics.
And you will see that it will

403
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:34,963
have an en- can have an enormous
impact on the properties of the

404
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:38,073
material.
Could I make you a dipole here

405
00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:40,863
in class?
Oh yeah, that's very easy.

406
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:45,01
To make one of nonconductors is
not so easy in class.

407
00:26:45,01 --> 00:26:48,04
To make one of conductors is
very easy.

408
00:26:48,04 --> 00:26:54,18
And I'm going to do that with
these two spheres that you have.

409
00:26:54,18 --> 00:26:56,836
Look at these two metal
spheres.

410
00:26:56,836 --> 00:26:59,064
Conductors.
Free electrons.

411
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:01,721
It's very easy for them to
move.

412
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:06,691
And I'm going to bring this
rubber rod which I will rub and

413
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:11,661
becomes I think negatively
charged if I remember correctly,

414
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:16,889
and I will bring that so close
to these two which are touching

415
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:19,974
each other.
So here is this one metal

416
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:25,03
sphere and here is the other
metal sphere and here comes the

417
00:27:25,03 --> 00:27:28,263
rubber.
Negatively charged.

418
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:29,873
Ah!
What's going to happen?

419
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:33,34
The electrons want to go away,
so this becomes negatively

420
00:27:33,34 --> 00:27:36,931
charged, and therefore this
remains a little bit positively

421
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:39,345
charged.
For every one electron that has

422
00:27:39,345 --> 00:27:41,884
is excess here,
when I start it's neutral,

423
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:45,227
there will be a positive excess
there because charge is

424
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:47,704
conserved.
You can't create charge out of

425
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:49,313
nothing.
And now what I do,

426
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:52,78
while this rubber is still
here, while that rubber rod is

427
00:27:52,78 --> 00:27:56,124
there, I separate them,
so here the- they're in contact

428
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:59,157
with each other first,
they

429
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:03,089
have to be in contact,
wow, we get some visitors.

430
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:06,448
[clap-clap] Don't be late,
that means you,

431
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:08,495
pretty boy.
I'm impressed.

432
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:11,608
Thank you.
Um so what I do now is while

433
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:15,867
this rubber rod is still in
place, I take them apart,

434
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:20,864
and when I take them apart this
negative charge is trapped and

435
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,86
this positive charge is trapped.
And so I have thereby created

436
00:28:25,86 --> 00:28:31,368
negative charge on this one.
Positive on this one and it's

437
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:33,97
equal in magnitude,
so I have a dipole.

438
00:28:33,97 --> 00:28:37,668
What I want to demonstrate to
you is that indeed I have

439
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:40,338
positive charged here and
negative here,

440
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:44,173
that there is a difference in
polarity between these two,

441
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:47,46
and that's the way that I will
do the experiment.

442
00:28:47,46 --> 00:28:51,5
I will not show you that the
amount of charge is exactly the

443
00:28:51,5 --> 00:28:54,376
same on each,
which of course it has to be.

444
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:58,553
So let me give you some better
light, or we have to get the uh

445
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:01,77
view graph off,
the overhead,

446
00:29:01,77 --> 00:29:05,303
you see there for the first
time an electroscope,

447
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:09,5
we discussed it last time,
it is a piece of aluminum foil,

448
00:29:09,5 --> 00:29:13,401
very thin, with a metal rod
next to it, and when I put

449
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:17,524
charge on the rod it will also
go into the aluminum foil,

450
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:21,72
and they will repel each other,
and so the -- the aluminum

451
00:29:21,72 --> 00:29:26,285
tinsel will go to the right and
the more charge there is on it,

452
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:28,641
the farther it goes to the
right.

453
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:34,088
So let me first put these two
together, make sure they are

454
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:37,601
completely discharged,
and now I'm going to bring

455
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:42,285
these two into an electric field
which is produced by this rubber

456
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:46,384
rod, I have to rub with the cat
fur, and I believe it was

457
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:50,629
negative but if you -- you'd
never have to remember whether

458
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:54,288
it's negative or positive of
course, that is not so

459
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:57,142
important, what is in a name,
after all.

460
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:59,484
But it did happen to be
negative.

461
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:01,021
OK.
So now we go here.

462
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:04,388
I bring it here,
I hope that no sparks will fly

463
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:08,682
over because that
ruins the demonstration.

464
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,416
And now notice what I do.
While the -- while the rod is

465
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:15,873
here I separate them.
So as I was holding it there,

466
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:20,022
things were going on in there
that you and I couldn't see but

467
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:23,618
electrons, the rubber rod is
negative, electrons were

468
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:27,905
shifting in this direction and
this is now positive and that is

469
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:30,878
now negative.
If I take this one and I touch

470
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:34,612
it with the electroscope,
you clearly see that there is

471
00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:37,517
charge on this.
How can I show you now that

472
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:41,916
there is
charge of different polarity on

473
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:45,693
the other one?
Well, the way I will do that is

474
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:49,553
I will approach this
electroscope by bring this

475
00:30:49,553 --> 00:30:54,169
sphere very close to it.
And if this charge is different

476
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:58,953
than the charge that is on it
the electroscope will -- the

477
00:30:58,953 --> 00:31:02,646
reading will become smaller.
And why is that?

478
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:05,583
Why will the reading become
smaller?

479
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:09,612
Well, here is the situation of
the

480
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:13,691
electroscope now.
And here is that ball that you

481
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:19,073
see on top, this is upside-down
there, if this is all negative,

482
00:31:19,073 --> 00:31:23,412
that's why it is apart,
if now I approach this here

483
00:31:23,412 --> 00:31:28,013
with an object which is
positively charged and I claim

484
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:33,221
that this one now is positively
charged, because this one was

485
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:37,3
negatively charged,
then electrons are afraid of

486
00:31:37,3 --> 00:31:42,228
the positive charge,
so more will go -- excuse me,

487
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:46,425
electrons love the positive
charge, so the electrons want to

488
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:50,481
come to the positive charge,
so these electrons drift down

489
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:54,109
again, and so if they come down,
fewer will be here,

490
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:57,524
and so you will see this.
If however I put here a

491
00:31:57,524 --> 00:32:00,441
negative rod,
then the electrons which are

492
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:03,927
here want to go further away,
they will stream up,

493
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:07,058
and therefore the reading will
become larger.

494
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:11,113
So you can always through
induction test what the polarity

495
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:15,235
is of your charge.
Let's hope that this one is

496
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:17,777
still holding its charge while I
was talking.

497
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:20,955
So I claim now that if this
polarity is different and if

498
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,786
it's still there when I approach
the electroscope,

499
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:26,443
come very close,
that the reading should become

500
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:28,812
a little smaller without even
touching it.

501
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:31,759
Let's see whether that works.
You see, it goes down.

502
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,608
You see, it goes down.
Goes down.

503
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:36,67
So through induction I have
demonstrated that this has

504
00:32:36,67 --> 00:32:39,039
indeed a different polarity from
this one.

505
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,332
If I approached it with this
one, it would go further out,

506
00:32:42,332 --> 00:32:46,613
unless it
already is at the maximum,

507
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:50,826
let's try that,
you see, it goes further out.

508
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:56,091
So not only have I demonstrated
that I created a dipole,

509
00:32:56,091 --> 00:33:01,74
but you've also seen that by
means of induction that you can

510
00:33:01,74 --> 00:33:07,293
demonstrate uh that the --
there's a difference in polarity

511
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:12,463
between the two spheres.
If I create a dipole and I put

512
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:17,846
that dipole in a --
in an electric field,

513
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:21,411
the dipole will start to
rotate.

514
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:26,126
Let's first talk about it.
Why it rotates.

515
00:33:26,126 --> 00:33:31,876
And then I will try to
demonstrate that by making a

516
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,981
dipole, a big one,
this big.

517
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:41,076
Right in front of you,
almost as big as the one there.

518
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:47,631
So let's have a -- an electric
field like so.

519
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:50,831
And I bring in this electric
field a dipole,

520
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:54,032
a biggie, here,
this is the one I'm going to

521
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,348
use for this demonstration.
Ping Pong balls on either side,

522
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:01,847
they are conducting,
and they are con- connected

523
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:04,377
with a rod which is not
conducting.

524
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:08,62
And so here is this dipole.
To this rod is not conducting.

525
00:34:08,62 --> 00:34:12,193
And this is a conducting and
this is a conductor.

526
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:16,212
And let's suppose this is
positive and this is negative

527
00:34:16,212 --> 00:34:19,902
for now.
And I'll show you how we get

528
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:22,974
the charge on it.
Well, the positive charge will

529
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:26,242
experience a force in this
direction, always in the

530
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:30,163
direction of the electric field,
and the negative charge will

531
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:32,386
experience a force always
upstream.

532
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:36,111
And now there is a torque on
this and there is a torque on

533
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:38,398
this dipole.
It will start to rotate

534
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:41,013
clockwise.
And of course if it overshoots

535
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:44,869
the field lines when it is in
this direction the torque will

536
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:46,829
reverse.
It's very easy to see.

537
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:52,279
And so what you will see,
it's going to oscillate and if

538
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:57,381
there is enough damping it will
come to a halt more or less in

539
00:34:57,381 --> 00:35:00,057
the direction of the field
lines.

540
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:03,736
And this is something that I
can demonstrate.

541
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:08,754
First I have to make a dipole
of this kind and the way I will

542
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:12,517
do that is the following.
This is a metal bar,

543
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:16,615
it's this insulator,
and here is this -- are these

544
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,462
two Ping Pong balls,
the one on this side has a

545
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:25,296
yellow marker,
the one on that side has an

546
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:28,914
orange marker,
and I'm going to attach them

547
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:32,188
holding them up against this
metal bar.

548
00:35:32,188 --> 00:35:35,203
In other words,
here is this dipole,

549
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:39,768
it's not a dipole yet,
metal metal and here is a metal

550
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:43,558
bar, this is a conductor which
connects them.

551
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:47,09
I'm going to turn on the
VandeGraaff here,

552
00:35:47,09 --> 00:35:52,259
and the VandeGraaff creates an
electric field,

553
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:54,417
so we have the VandeGraaff
here.

554
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:58,386
And let's suppose that this
VandeGraaff creates a positive

555
00:35:58,386 --> 00:36:01,032
charge.
Sometimes a VandeGraaff creates

556
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:04,723
positive charge on the dome,
others can be designed to

557
00:36:04,723 --> 00:36:07,091
create negative charge on the
dome.

558
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:10,224
And remember for now I assume
that's positive.

559
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:13,636
What will happen now?
Electrons want to go in this

560
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:16,074
direction.
So this becomes negative.

561
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:18,58
Protons positive charge stays
behind.

562
00:36:18,58 --> 00:36:21,505
So that becomes through
induction a dipole.

563
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:25,032
Because I have them
connected.

564
00:36:25,032 --> 00:36:28,07
I have them connected with this
metal bar.

565
00:36:28,07 --> 00:36:32,071
So these electrons can flow
through this bar and end up

566
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:33,998
here.
Now I remove the bar.

567
00:36:33,998 --> 00:36:38,148
And so when I remove the bar I
have created now a dipole.

568
00:36:38,148 --> 00:36:42,297
I have here an insulating
thread and I have a fishing rod

569
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:46,892
and at the end of my fishing rod
I have now a permanent dipole.

570
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:51,412
With that permanent dipole I'm
now going to probe the electric

571
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:56,969
field around this VandeGraaff.
I could have chosen the same

572
00:36:56,969 --> 00:37:00,809
VandeGraaff but there's a
reason why I picked this one and

573
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:04,177
as I walk around this
VandeGraaff you will see that

574
00:37:04,177 --> 00:37:08,085
this fishing rod at the end is
this dipole, that the dipole

575
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:12,059
always wants to go radially
inwards or outwards depending on

576
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:15,966
how you look at it of this
field, so I can probe this field

577
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:19,671
and make you see for the first
time that there is indeed

578
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:23,578
somewhere here a strong radial
field going in or out of the

579
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:26,273
VandeGraaff.
And now comes something very

580
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:30,324
interesting,
which I found out this morning

581
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:33,47
for the first time when I did
this experiment.

582
00:37:33,47 --> 00:37:37,735
If the other VandeGraaff there
is also positive when I run it,

583
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:41,93
how do you think this dipole is
going to align then if I walk

584
00:37:41,93 --> 00:37:44,237
into it?
Will the negative ball be

585
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:48,362
closer to the VandeGraaff or
will the positive one go closer

586
00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:51,858
to the VandeGraaff?
So I give you thirty seconds to

587
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:54,934
think about it,
so I make the dipole as it is

588
00:37:54,934 --> 00:38:00,108
here, let's assume this one is
positive, this VandeGraaff.

589
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:03,525
So this side becomes minus,
I call that A,

590
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:06,776
and this side become positive,
that's B.

591
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:11,193
I now walk with this dipole,
I bring it in this field.

592
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:14,694
And let's assume that one is
also positive.

593
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:19,111
We don't know that yet.
How will the dipole align now?

594
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:22,362
Will A go inwards or will A go
outwards?

595
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:25,363
Who thinks A goes inwards?
Very good.

596
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:27,696
Who says A goes outwards?
OK.

597
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:31,531
A will go inwards.
If the two VandeGraaffs have

598
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:37,076
the same polarity.
So if that doesn't happen tha-

599
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:40,604
that doesn't mean that physics
doesn't work,

600
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:45,116
it means the two VandeGraaffs
have different polarities.

601
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:49,711
And we'll see what happens.
So let me first then create a

602
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:52,665
dipole.
So here is the -- the dipole.

603
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:56,111
It's shorted out now.
I turn on the -- this

604
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:59,146
VandeGraaff.
So induction takes place.

605
00:38:59,146 --> 00:39:03,987
Remember that the yellow is
pointing towards the VandeGraaff

606
00:39:03,987 --> 00:39:08,253
and that the orange is away from
the

607
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:09,872
VandeGraaff.
OK.

608
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:12,461
So I induce a dipole.
Oh.

609
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:18,502
I really should redo that.
I don't know what happens when

610
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:22,602
it -- I have to remove the field
first.

611
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:25,299
OK.
The yellow was inside,

612
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:28,967
right, was that the way it was?
OK.

613
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,772
Yellow inside.
There we go.

614
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:39,108
So now it's creating a dipole
through this metal bar.

615
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:44,774
And I break contact and this
should now be a dipole.

616
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:51,219
Now I turn on the field of the
-- so if the polarity is the

617
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:56,553
same, yellow will go in.
I will try to swing it a

618
00:39:56,553 --> 00:39:59,33
little.
Notice two things.

619
00:39:59,33 --> 00:40:04,775
It's going to line up
beautifully radially but the

620
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:09,998
yellow is not in,
the yellow is out.

621
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:14,306
So the two VandeGraaffs have
different polarities.

622
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:17,383
But you will see they rotate
nicely.

623
00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:22,571
And they end up beautifully
radial and when I go all the way

624
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:28,023
around here again they may swing
a little, they may oscillate a

625
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:33,386
little, but through damping they
will come to a halt and look,

626
00:40:33,386 --> 00:40:38,75
the field is indeed beautifully
radial and the yellow is so to

627
00:40:38,75 --> 00:40:43,058
speak on the wrong side.
The two VandeGraaffs have

628
00:40:43,058 --> 00:40:46,754
different
polarities.

629
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:55,545
So you see how we can create a
dipole and you've also seen how

630
00:40:55,545 --> 00:41:04,048
we often can make statements
about uh the specific polarity.

631
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:11,83
I can probe an electric field
using grass seeds in oil.

632
00:41:11,83 --> 00:41:18,538
Grass seeds are elongated
and when I put a grass seed in

633
00:41:18,538 --> 00:41:21,338
the electric field it will
become polarized,

634
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:23,616
there's nothing you can do
about it.

635
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:27,132
Here is a grass seed and the
electric field is like so.

636
00:41:27,132 --> 00:41:31,233
And so the electrons want to go
as far away in this direction as

637
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:34,553
they can through induction.
And so this side remains

638
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:37,938
positive, and so what is this
grass seed going to do?

639
00:41:37,938 --> 00:41:41,258
It's going to rotate.
It's going to line up with the

640
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:44,058
electric field.
And this is the way that I'm

641
00:41:44,058 --> 00:41:47,963
going to show you now field
configurations

642
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:52,581
in the vicinity of a dipole.
And I will also show you then

643
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:56,955
field configurations in a
vicinity of two charges which

644
00:41:56,955 --> 00:42:01,005
have equal polarity.
You may have seen this in high

645
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:04,569
school with magnetic fields,
with iron files,

646
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:08,457
that's kid stuff.
That's the easiest thing to do.

647
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:12,588
This is the real thing,
this is the electric fields,

648
00:42:12,588 --> 00:42:17,367
I bet you you've never seen
electric fields which are traced

649
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:21,66
by these mysterious seeds.
So I'll give you some light

650
00:42:21,66 --> 00:42:25,954
that may optimize the
demonstration.

651
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:31,783
These seeds first have to be
oriented in a way so that it is

652
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:35,34
chaos.
The first thing you see is I'm

653
00:42:35,34 --> 00:42:41,565
going to make this -- I believe
it's going to be a dipole first.

654
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:45,616
Almost certain.
So I'm going to charge one

655
00:42:45,616 --> 00:42:49,371
positive and charge the other
negative.

656
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:54,707
And then we'll see how these
grass seeds will form each

657
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:56,683
other.
Watch closely.

658
00:42:56,683 --> 00:43:00,512
There you go.
My goodness.

659
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:03,346
That is a wonderful dipole
field.

660
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:08,747
Of course we don't know which
one is plus or minus because the

661
00:43:08,747 --> 00:43:11,757
grass seeds have no arrows on
them.

662
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:16,185
But you clearly see these
incredible lines radially

663
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:21,675
inwards or outwards on each one
of the charges and then you see

664
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:26,191
these nice arcs in between.
Who could see it easily?

665
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:31,503
OK, you got something worth for
your twenty thousand dollars'

666
00:43:31,503 --> 00:43:36,967
tuition.
Put a little bit more charge on

667
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,797
maybe.
Very clear.

668
00:43:38,797 --> 00:43:45,043
And now which is perhaps more
interesting, I'd like to show

669
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:51,504
you the field surrounding two
charges but now the charges are

670
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:57,103
both the same polarity.
So we have to undo the -- the

671
00:43:57,103 --> 00:44:03,134
memory of the grass seeds.
OK, now we'll try to make them

672
00:44:03,134 --> 00:44:07,521
both
the same polarity.

673
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:16,254
And then watch this hairblower
effect that I told you about.

674
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:23,359
Maybe not make -- I'm not sure
they made contact.

675
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,947
OK, we'll try it again.
Come on.

676
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:34,608
It's very funny,
you know, it looks like there

677
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:38,54
is
some -- some charge hidden

678
00:44:38,54 --> 00:44:43,183
because it doesn't look as
beautiful as we had earlier on

679
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:46,914
the Maxwell view graph.
It seems like there is

680
00:44:46,914 --> 00:44:50,479
something here on the side which
it prefers.

681
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,708
And therefore the electric
field is being distorted.

682
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:59,185
Let me try to discharge it.
I'm a reasonable conductor,

683
00:44:59,185 --> 00:45:03,248
so I should be able to take any
stray charges off.

684
00:45:03,248 --> 00:45:04,989
Oh, wait a minute.
Ha!

685
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:10,416
I had it upside-down.
[laughter] Oh my goodness.

686
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,23
Can happen to anyone.
All right.

687
00:45:13,23 --> 00:45:16,951
So they were never really in
good contact,

688
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:19,673
we ready now?
Ah, look at that.

689
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:23,031
Great.
Now you really cle- clearly see

690
00:45:23,031 --> 00:45:28,205
these -- these field lines,
and you see in between how the

691
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:32,198
two airblowers are competing
with each other.

692
00:45:32,198 --> 00:45:36,191
Very impressive.
All right, so that's the way

693
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:41,604
you see field lines now,
electric field lines.

694
00:45:41,604 --> 00:45:46,359
And some of you may have seen
with iron files uh magnetic

695
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:50,009
field lines.
If I have the VandeGraaff and I

696
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:54
have the VandeGraaff here,
and let's suppose the

697
00:45:54 --> 00:45:58,16
VandeGraaff is positive,
I don't know whether it's

698
00:45:58,16 --> 00:46:01,556
positive or negative,
let's suppose it's,

699
00:46:01,556 --> 00:46:06,48
I'm going to use the one over
there, and I'm going to stand

700
00:46:06,48 --> 00:46:09,281
here, on the ground,
Walter Lewin,

701
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:13,356
what is going to happen with
me?

702
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:17,378
Through induction,
the electrons being sucked out

703
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:22,238
of the earth and coming up
because they want to go close to

704
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:26,177
the positive charge.
So I will become negatively

705
00:46:26,177 --> 00:46:29,277
charged.
What will the field lines do?

706
00:46:29,277 --> 00:46:32,461
Oh, they will be extremely
complicated.

707
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:36,399
Very complicated.
But something like this maybe.

708
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:40,756
Maybe something like this.
Uh some may come out here.

709
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,695
Some may end up on my neck
here.

710
00:46:44,695 --> 00:46:46,355
Some may go here.
Like so.

711
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:48,812
Very complicated field
configurations.

712
00:46:48,812 --> 00:46:52,065
But I want to probe that field.
Somehow, a little.

713
00:46:52,065 --> 00:46:55,585
Get a feeling for how that --
what that field is like.

714
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:59,104
And the way I'm going to do
that is I'm going to put a

715
00:46:59,104 --> 00:47:01,893
charged balloon.
There you see the balloon.

716
00:47:01,893 --> 00:47:04,749
It's a conductor.
I'm going to put a charged

717
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:08,335
balloon and put it here say.
Well if it is a positively

718
00:47:08,335 --> 00:47:11,655
charged balloon it will take off
in that direction.

719
00:47:11,655 --> 00:47:14,045
Right?
The force is always tangential

720
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:18,365
to the field lines.
It will abandon the field

721
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:22,091
lines, it won't stay on the
field lines, there's a lot of

722
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:25,684
damping on the balloon,
that's why I chose the balloon,

723
00:47:25,684 --> 00:47:29,276
so it will move relatively
slowly, and it'll ultimately

724
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:31,605
maybe end up on my head,
right here.

725
00:47:31,605 --> 00:47:35,464
Once it ends up on my head
there, so it comes in maybe like

726
00:47:35,464 --> 00:47:39,257
this, now it will get the
negative charge from my head and

727
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:43,116
so it will become immediately
negatively charged and so the

728
00:47:43,116 --> 00:47:47,706
force now will reverse and will
be in this direction,

729
00:47:47,706 --> 00:47:50,831
tangential to this field line,
and so it will go back.

730
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:54,015
When it hits the VandeGraaff
again it will get positive

731
00:47:54,015 --> 00:47:56,903
charge, reverse its polarity,
and it will go back.

732
00:47:56,903 --> 00:48:00,264
And so it will b- bounce back
and forth between me and the

733
00:48:00,264 --> 00:48:03,742
VandeGraaff and it gives you
some rough feeling of what this

734
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:07,161
field configuration is about,
although I want to remind you

735
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:10,168
that the charge does not follow
exactly field lines.

736
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:13,175
So I'm going to sit here and I
will be part of this,

737
00:48:13,175 --> 00:48:16,712
so that's probably going to be
positive, I will automatically

738
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:21,682
become negative,
there's nothing I have to do,

739
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:27,696
all I turn is the VandeGraaff
and we have to put a little bit

740
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:33,007
of charge on that balloon.
It will probably do that by

741
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:39,422
itself, but I can always give it
a little kick so that it goes to

742
00:48:39,422 --> 00:48:42,429
the VandeGraaff,
there it goes.

743
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:47,941
[laughter] Oh [inaudible]
because my -- my glasses are a

744
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:52,15
good insulator,
so I better take my glasses

745
00:48:52,15 --> 00:48:57,061
off, so that every time it hits
me.

746
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:03,048
[laughter] Changes polarity.
[laughter] So this is a way you

747
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:07,513
can do physics and have fun at
the same time.

748
00:49:07,513 --> 49:13
See you Monday.
[applause]
