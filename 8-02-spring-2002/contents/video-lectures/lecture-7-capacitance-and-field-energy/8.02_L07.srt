00:00:00 --> 00:00:00



2
00:00:01 --> 00:00:02,611
assemble charges,
I have to do work,

3
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:06,789
we discussed that earlier.
And we call that electrostatic

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,998
potential energy.
Today, I will look at this

5
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:14,251
energy concept in a different
way, and I will evaluate the

6
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:17,012
energy in terms of the electric
field.

7
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:21,19
Suppose I have two parallel
plates, and I charge this one

8
00:00:21,19 --> 00:00:24,771
with positive charge,
which is the surface charge

9
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:28,428
density times the area of the
plate, and this one,

10
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,338
negative charge,
which

11
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:36,407
is the surface charge density
negative times the area of the

12
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:39,071
plate.
And let's assume that the

13
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:44,227
separation between these two is
H, and so we have an electric

14
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:49,468
field, which is approximately
constant, and the electric field

15
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:52,648
here is sigma divided by epsilon
zero.

16
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:57,718
And now, I'm going to take the
upper plate, and I'm going to

17
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,381
move it up.
And so as I do that,

18
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:05,488
I have to apply a force,
because these two plates

19
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:08,413
attract each other,
so I have to do work.

20
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:11,923
And as I move this up,
and I will move it up over

21
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:16,092
distance X, I am creating here,
electric field that wasn't

22
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:19,31
there before.
And the electric field that I'm

23
00:01:19,31 --> 00:01:22,674
creating has exactly the same
strength as this,

24
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:26,843
because the charge on the
plates is not changing when I am

25
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:30,499
moving, the surface charge
density is not changing,

26
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:33,132
all I do is,
I increase the distance.

27
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:37,587
And so I am creating electric
field in here.

28
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:39,84
And for that,
I have to do work,

29
00:01:39,84 --> 00:01:42,384
that's another way of looking
at it.

30
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:46,599
How much work do I have to do?
What is the work that Walter

31
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:50,669
Lewin has to do in moving this
plate over the distance X?

32
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:55,103
Well, that is the force that I
have to apply over the distance

33
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:56,847
X.
The force is constant,

34
00:01:56,847 --> 00:02:00,99
and so I can simply multiply
the force times the distance,

35
00:02:00,99 --> 00:02:04,624
that will give me work.
And so the question now is,

36
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:10,366
what is the force that I have
to apply to move this plate up?

37
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:13,959
And your first guess would be
that the force would be the

38
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,36
charge on the plate times the
electric field strength,

39
00:02:17,36 --> 00:02:20,761
a complete reasonable guess,
because, you would argue,

40
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:24,676
"Well, if we have an electric
field E, and we bring a charge Q

41
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:27,628
in there, then the electric
force is Q times E,

42
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:31,542
I have to overcome that force,
so my force is Q times E." Yes,

43
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:34,687
that holds most of the time.
But not in this case.

44
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,409
It's a little bit more subtle.
Let me take this plate here,

45
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,388
and enlarge that plate.
So here is the plate.

46
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:46,631
So you see the thickness of the
plate, now, this is one plate.

47
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:50,178
We all agree that the plus
charge is at the surface,

48
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:53,448
well, but, of course,
it has to be in the plate.

49
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:57,552
And so there is here this layer
of charge Q, which is at the

50
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:01,099
bottom of the plate.
And the thickness of that layer

51
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,325
may only be one atomic
thickness.

52
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:06,664
But it's not zero.
And on this side of the plate,

53
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:10,072
is there electric field,
which is sigma divided by

54
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:13,689
epsilon zero.
But inside the plate,

55
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:17,823
which is a conductor,
the electric field is zero.

56
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,924
And therefore,
the electric field is,

57
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:25,058
in this charge Q,
is the average between the two.

58
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:29,02
And so the force on this
charge, in this layer,

59
00:03:29,02 --> 00:03:32,723
is not Q times E,
but is one-half Q times E.

60
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:36,513
So I take the average between
these E fields,

61
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:39,527
and this E field is then this
value.

62
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:45,47
And so now I can calculate the
work that I have to do,

63
00:03:45,47 --> 00:03:50,043
the work that I have to do is
now my force,

64
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:56,467
which is one-half Q times E,
and I move that over a distance

65
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,625
X.
And so what I can do now is

66
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:05,287
replace Q by sigma A,
so I get one-half sigma A times

67
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:10,84
E times X, and I multiply
upstairs and downstairs by

68
00:04:10,84 --> 00:04:14,869
epsilon zero,
so that multiply by one.

69
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:19,769
And the reason why I do that
is,

70
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,385
because then I get another
sigma divided by epsilon zero

71
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:28,245
here -- divided by epsilon zero,
and that is E,

72
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:31,938
and therefore,
I now have that the total work

73
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:37,226
that I, Walter Lewin have to do
-- has to do is one-half epsilon

74
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:41,339
zero, E-squared times A times X.
And look at this.

75
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:44,78
A X is the new volume that I
have created,

76
00:04:44,78 --> 00:04:49,732
it is the new volume in which I
have created electric field.

77
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:55,11
And this, now,
calls for a  work  done by

78
00:04:55,11 --> 00:04:58,394
Walter Lewin.
Per unit volume,

79
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:03,15
and that, now,
equals one-half epsilon zero

80
00:05:03,15 --> 00:05:08,132
times E squared.
This is the work that I have

81
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:13,567
done per unit volume.
And since this work created

82
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:18,21
electric field,
we called it "field energy

83
00:05:18,21 --> 00:05:24,473
density".
And it is in joules per cubic

84
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:26,932
meter.
And it can be shown that,

85
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:31,373
in general, the electric field
energy density is one-half

86
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,418
epsilon zero E squared,
not only for this particular

87
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,511
charge configuration,
but for any charge

88
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,573
configuration.
And so, now,

89
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:45,173
we have a new way of looking at
the energy that it takes to

90
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:48,98
assemble charges.
Earlier, we calculated the work

91
00:05:48,98 --> 00:05:52,628
that we have to do to put the
charges in place,

92
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:56,188
now,
if it is more convenient,

93
00:05:56,188 --> 00:06:00,4
we could calculate that the
energy  electrostatic potential

94
00:06:00,4 --> 00:06:04,611
energy, is the integral of
one-half epsilon zero E-squared,

95
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:09,114
over all space -- if necessary,
you have to go all the way down

96
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:12,018
to infinity -- and here,
I have now, D V,

97
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:15,068
this is volume.
This has nothing to do with

98
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:18,626
potential, this V,
in physics, we often run out of

99
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:22,039
symbols, V is sometimes
potential, in this case,

100
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,234
it is volume.
And the only reason why I chose

101
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:28,945
H
there is I already have a D

102
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:32,726
here, so I didn't want two Ds.
Normally, we take D as the

103
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,291
separation between plates.
And so this,

104
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:39,071
now, is another way of looking
at electrostatic potential

105
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:41,636
energy.
We look at it now only from the

106
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:45,619
point of view of all the energy
being in the electric field,

107
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:49,535
and we no longer think of it,
perhaps, as the work that you

108
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,897
have done to assemble these
charges.

109
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:55,678
I will demonstrate later today
that as I separate the two

110
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:59,12
plates from these charged
planes,

111
00:06:59,12 --> 00:07:01,226
that indeed,
I have to do work.

112
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:05,227
I will convince you that by
creating electric fields that,

113
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:08,385
indeed, I will be doing work.
So, from now on,

114
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:12,035
uh, we have the choice.
If you want to calculate what

115
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:16,106
the electrostatic potential
energy is, you either calculate

116
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:20,107
the work that you have to do to
bring all these charges in

117
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:24,177
place, or, if it is easier,
you can take the electric field

118
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,774
everywhere in space,
if you know that,

119
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:30,564
and do an integration over all
space.

120
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:32,574
We could do that,
for instance,

121
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:36,593
for these two parallel plates
now, and we can ask what is now

122
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:40,077
the total energy in these plates
-- uh, in the field.

123
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:42,153
And at home,
I would advise you,

124
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:45,234
to do that the way that it's
done in your book,

125
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:48,919
whereby you actually assemble
the charges minus Q at the

126
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,938
bottom and plus Q at the top,
and you calculate how much work

127
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:55,282
you have to do.
That's one approach.

128
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:58,565
I will now choose the other
approach, and that is,

129
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:03,857
by simply saying that the total
energy in the field of these

130
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:07,6
plane-parallel plates,
is the integral of one-half

131
00:08:07,6 --> 00:08:11,727
epsilon zero E-squared,
over the entire volume of these

132
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:14,936
two plates.
And since the electric field is

133
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:18,145
outside, zero,
everywhere, it's a very easy

134
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:20,819
integral, because I know the
volume.

135
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,945
The volume that I have,
if the separation is H -- so we

136
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:29,606
still have them H apart -- this
volume that I have is simply A

137
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:34,267
times H, and the electric field
is constant, and so I get here

138
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:38,064
that
this is one-half epsilon zero.

139
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:41,572
For E, if I want to,
I can write sigma divided by

140
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,838
epsilon zero,
I can square that,

141
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:47,2
and D V, in- doing the integral
over all space,

142
00:08:47,2 --> 00:08:51,439
means simply I get A times H,
it is the volume of that box.

143
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:54,874
So I get A times H.
And so this is now the total

144
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:58,09
energy  that I have,
I lose one epsilon here,

145
00:08:58,09 --> 00:09:01,89
I have an epsilon zero squared
and I have an epsilon.

146
00:09:01,89 --> 00:09:08,249
I also remember that the charge
Q on the plate is A times sigma,

147
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,718
and that the potential
difference V,

148
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:14,387
this now is not volume,
it's the potential difference

149
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,844
between the plates,
is the electric field times H.

150
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:22,218
The electric field is constant,
it can go from one plate to the

151
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:26,381
other, the integral E dot D L in
going from one plate to the

152
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:29,203
other, gives me the potential
difference.

153
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:33,295
And so I can substitute that
now in here, I can take for A,

154
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:37,317
sigma, I can put in the Q,
and you can also show that this

155
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,636
is
one-half Q V.

156
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:42,421
V being, now,
the potential difference

157
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,958
between the plates.
And so this is a rather fast

158
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,248
way that you can calculate what
the total energy is in the

159
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:52,506
field, or, say,
the same thing,

160
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:56,645
the total work you have to do
to assemble these charges.

161
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:00,785
Or, to say it differently,
the total work you have to do

162
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:04,473
to create electric fields.
You have crela- created

163
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:07,634
electric fields that were not
there before.

164
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:11,623
I now will introduce something
that

165
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:17,431
we haven't had before,
that is the word "capacitance".

166
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:24,117
I will define the capacitance
of an object to be the charge of

167
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:29,706
that object divided by the
potential of that object.

168
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:35,405
And so the unit is coulombs per
volt, this V is volt,

169
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:42,091
now, it's potential.
Uh, but we never say that it is

170
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:46,585
coulombs per volt in physics,
we write for that a capital F,

171
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,718
which is Farad,
we call that,

172
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:52,907
one farad is the unit of
capacitance, undoubtedly called

173
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:57,173
after the great maestro Faraday,
we will learn more about

174
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:00,601
Faraday later in this course.
So let us go to,

175
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:05,4
um, a sphere which has a radius
R, and let us calculate what the

176
00:11:05,4 --> 00:11:09,361
capacitance is of this sphere.
Think of it as being a

177
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:13,932
conductor, and we bring a
certain charge Q on

178
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:18,231
this conductor,
it will then get a potential V,

179
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:23,184
which we know is Q divided by
four pi, epsilon zero R.

180
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:27,764
We've seen this many times,
and so, by definition,

181
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:32,343
the capacitance now is Q
divided by the potential,

182
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:36,269
and therefore,
this becomes four pi epsilon

183
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,82
zero R.
So that is the capacitance of a

184
00:11:39,82 --> 00:11:43,839
single sphere.
And so we can now look at the

185
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,135
values
as a function of R.

186
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:50,504
I have here some numbers,
I calculated it for the

187
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:53,733
VandeGraaff, and I calculated it
for the Earth.

188
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:57,032
If you want one Farad
capacitance, that's a real

189
00:11:57,032 --> 00:12:00,963
biggie, you need a radius of 9
times ten to the 9 meters,

190
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:04,542
that's the four pi epsilon zero
that comes in there.

191
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,35
That's huge,
that's twenty-five times the

192
00:12:07,35 --> 00:12:11,491
distance from the Earth to the
moon, that's a big sphere  to

193
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:16,455
have a capacitance of one Farad.
The Earth itself,

194
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:19,44
with a radius of sixty-four
hundred kilometers,

195
00:12:19,44 --> 00:12:22,75
would have seven hundred
microfarad, the VandeGraaff

196
00:12:22,75 --> 00:12:25,801
thirty centimeters radius would
be 30 picofarad,

197
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,072
the pico is ten to the minus
twelve.

198
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:31,707
And if you take a sphere with a
radius of one centimeter,

199
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,394
then you have,
uh, roughly,

200
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:36,25
one picofarad,
ten to the minus twelve Farad.

201
00:12:36,25 --> 00:12:39,885
So this gives you a rough idea
about the size of objects,

202
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,546
and how they connect to their
capacitance.

203
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:45,921
So if I bring all these
spheres,

204
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:49,496
uh, at the same potential,
so I charge them all up to the

205
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:52,306
same potential,
then the one with the largest

206
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,988
capacitance, uh,
will have the most charge.

207
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:58,245
And that, of course,
is where the word "capacitance"

208
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:02,204
comes from, it is the capability
of holding charge for a given,

209
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:05,141
uh, electric potential.
Don't confuse that with

210
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:08,078
electric fields,
because if you bring all these

211
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,974
spheres at the same potential,
then the one with the strongest

212
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:14,719
electric field,
that's the one which has the

213
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:18,11
short --
smallest radius,

214
00:13:18,11 --> 00:13:23,423
we discussed that last time.
Now, I will look at the

215
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:26,965
situation a little bit
differently.

216
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,569
I have, here,
a sphere, B,

217
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:34,777
positively charged,
and I place it close to another

218
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:38,736
sphere, A, which is negatively
charged.

219
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:44,465
And so, by my definition,
I can say that the capacitance

220
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:49,57
of B is the charge that I have
on B

221
00:13:49,57 --> 00:13:54,67
divided by the potential of B.
That will be my definition.

222
00:13:54,67 --> 00:13:58,608
But, there is here,
this object which charged

223
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:01,292
negative.
And how did we define

224
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:04,604
potential?
Potential was work per unit

225
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:06,751
charge.
I go to infinity,

226
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:10,241
I put plus Q in my pocket,
I approach B,

227
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:15,611
and the work I have to do per
unit charge is the potential of

228
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:20,354
B, that's the definition of
potential.

229
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:24,388
But B is repelling me.
So I have to do positive work.

230
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:28,888
But A is now attracting me.
And so the work I have to do is

231
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:33,621
less the work per unit charge.
And so, because of the presence

232
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:37,423
of A, the potential of B goes
down, and therefore,

233
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:41,924
the capacitance of B goes up.
And so now, you see that that

234
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:46,346
the presence of this charged
sphere here has an influence,

235
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:49,76
an important impact,
on the capacitance of B,

236
00:14:49,76 --> 00:14:53,096
and, therefore,
it is really

237
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:56,52
unintelligible to call this the
capacitance of B.

238
00:14:56,52 --> 00:15:00,299
We think of it as the
capacitance of B in the presence

239
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,866
of A.
So it's no longer just B alone.

240
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:07,145
And so I'm now going to change
the definition of capacitance.

241
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:10,497
And I'm going to change it in
the following way.

242
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:14,134
I have two conductors.
And these two conductors have

243
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:17,058
the same charge,
but different polarities.

244
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:21,55
And now the capacitance of this
combination of two conductors is

245
00:15:21,55 --> 00:15:26,126
the charge on one of them --
which is the same,

246
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,907
of course, on the charge of the
other, except different polarity

247
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,791
-- divided by the potential
difference.

248
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,523
So that, now,
is my new definition of

249
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:39,407
capacitance.
So we always deal with two

250
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:43,202
objects, not with one in
isolation, if you have the

251
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:46,921
charge on one of the two,
and you divide it by the

252
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:49,653
potential difference between the
two.

253
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:53,22
Uh, you may say,
"Well, it's a little artificial

254
00:15:53,22 --> 00:15:56,93
to have two, eh,
conductors and one is

255
00:15:56,93 --> 00:15:59,511
positively charged,
and the other has exactly the

256
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:01,608
same amount of negatively
charge." Well,

257
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:03,759
it is not so artificial as you
may think.

258
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,963
Uh, remember,
then, we have this Windhurst

259
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:09,136
machine, which I was cranking,
and I was  charging one plate

260
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,018
positive and the other one
negative.

261
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:13,922
And without my doing anything,
if one becomes positive,

262
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,986
the other one becomes negative
by exactly the same amount,

263
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:19,514
because you cannot create
charge out of nothing.

264
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:22,31
So if you charge one thing
positive, chances are that

265
00:16:22,31 --> 00:16:25,16
something else is charged
negative by the same amount,

266
00:16:25,16 --> 00:16:30,151
but with opposite polarity.
So it's not so artificial,

267
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:33,895
that you have two conductors
with the same charge but

268
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:37,568
opposite polarities.
So, now, we have two conductors

269
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:41,528
there, so if we go to this --
these two parallel plates,

270
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:44,121
the question,
now, is what is not the

271
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,649
capacitance, then,
according to our new definition

272
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,394
of these parallel plates?
Well, that's capacitance C,

273
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:54,994
is the charge on one plate
divided by the potential

274
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:58,595
difference between the two
plates.

275
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:01,001
And the charge on one plate is
sigma A.

276
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:04,357
And the potential difference
between the plates is the

277
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,586
integral of E dot D L,
they are separated there by a

278
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,802
-- a distance H.
I will change that,

279
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:12,335
now, to a D,
because that's more commonly

280
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:15,185
done, that the separation
between plates is D.

281
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:18,541
There was a reason why I didn't
want to put a D there,

282
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,137
because I didn't want to get
you confused,

283
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:25,063
but now, there is no confusion.
And so the potential difference

284
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,925
is the electric field between
the plates times the distance D.

285
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:32,281
But E itself is sigma divided
by

286
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,287
epsilon zero,
so we get here,

287
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,366
sigma divided by epsilon zero,
divided by D,

288
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:40,446
I lose my sigma,
and so, two parallel plates

289
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:44,743
have this as the capacitance.
It's linearly proportional with

290
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:48,396
the area of the plates,
that's intuitively pleasing.

291
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:52,048
The larger the plate,
the more charge you can put on

292
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:54,698
there.
And it's inversely proportional

293
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,277
with the distance between the
plates.

294
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,929
The smaller you make the
distance, the larger is the

295
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:05,065
capacitance.
Well, that goes back to this

296
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:09,103
idea, that the closer A is to B,
the larger effect that will

297
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:12,524
have on the capacitance.
And if you bring them very

298
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,466
close together,
this potential will go down,

299
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:17,724
and so the capacitance will go
up.

300
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:21,625
So it's not too surprising that
you see D here downstairs.

301
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,183
The closer you bring the plates
together, the higher,

302
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:28,672
uh, the capacitance will be.
Let us look at a -- uh,

303
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:33,189
at some numbers.
Suppose I have a  a plate,

304
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:38,932
very large, twenty five meters
long, and five centimeters wide

305
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:43,922
-- twenty five meters long,
and five centimeters wide.

306
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:48,159
I have two of them.
Called a  plate capacitor.

307
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,055
And let the distance between
them, D, let D be -- oh,

308
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:57,857
let's make it very small,
because we want a real big

309
00:18:57,857 --> 00:19:01,153
capacitor, point oh one
millimeters.

310
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:07,448
Very small game between them.
So, now I substitute the

311
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:10,39
numbers in there,
I can calculate the area,

312
00:19:10,39 --> 00:19:14,383
I have to calculate the area
here for the plates in square

313
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:17,396
meters, of course,
multiply by epsilon zero,

314
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:20,898
and divide it by D in meters,
and when you do that,

315
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:25,102
you find that the capacitance
of this big monster is only one

316
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:27,203
microfarad.
It's not very much.

317
00:19:27,203 --> 00:19:31,196
And when you go to Radio Shack,
and you buy yourself a one

318
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:34,769
microfarad capacitor,
you don't by something that is

319
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:38,544
twenty five meters long,
and yea big.

320
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,362
Well, you may actually have --
you may actually buy that

321
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:46,11
without you realizing that.
Because these large plates,

322
00:19:46,11 --> 00:19:49,72
these very long ribbons of
conductors, two very close

323
00:19:49,72 --> 00:19:52,982
together, separated by some
insulating material,

324
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:55,342
very thin, they're rolled up
often.

325
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:58,743
And you don't notice that,
but they are rolled up,

326
00:19:58,743 --> 00:20:02,699
and they are put in a little
canister, and that then gives

327
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:06,656
you a parallel plate capacitor.
Uh, I brought one with me,

328
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:11,464
unintelligible one that I have
used for several years,

329
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:15,187
but, today I decided to cut it
open for you so that you can

330
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:18,205
look inside, and then you
actually will see the,

331
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:21,671
um, you're going to see,
there, this is the canister in

332
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:24,496
which it was,
and so I cut the canister open,

333
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:27,385
and when you look here,
you see, there is this

334
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:31,044
conductor -- looks like aluminum
foil -- and then there is

335
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:33,74
insulating material,
and then you find more

336
00:20:33,74 --> 00:20:37,464
conductor, on the other side.
And so you -- and it's rolled

337
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:41,361
up.
Here, if I unroll it here --

338
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:44,778
I'm breaking it,
but that's OK -- so you see the

339
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:48,777
idea of a parallel plate
capacitor, how it can be rolled

340
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:53,429
up nicely, and you not realizing
that you're really talking often

341
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,119
about meters,
many meters of material.

342
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,827
Now, through chemical
techniques, the distance D can

343
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:03,389
easily be made a thousand times
smaller than this.

344
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:06,661
And if the distance is thousand
times smaller,

345
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:10,368
then you would get a
capacitance of

346
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:14,329
one thousand microfarads.
Compare that with the Earth,

347
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:17,243
which is only seven hundred
microfarads.

348
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:21,129
So a capacitor like this is one
thousand microfarads.

349
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:24,566
If we bring the potential
difference over here,

350
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:28,227
then we get a tremendous amount
of charge on here.

351
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:32,711
In fact, if I hold this in my
hands, and if I assume that the

352
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:37,269
potential difference between my
left hand and my right hand is

353
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:40,332
ten millivolts,
then I would bring on this

354
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:45,615
capacitor, ten microCoulombs.
That is a tremendous amount of

355
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:47,829
charge.
In fact, ten microCoulombs is

356
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:51,334
the maximum charge we can ever
put on the big VandeGraaff,

357
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:54,287
we calculated it last time.
If we put more on the

358
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:56,439
VandeGraaff, it goes into
discharge.

359
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:59,638
And by simply holding this in
my hands, I can put ten

360
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,852
microCoulombs here on this
capacitor.

361
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:03,881
Now, you may say,
"Well, yes, but,

362
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:07,695
uh, potential difference would
be your right hand and your left

363
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:10,032
hand, ten millivolts,
isn't that funny?

364
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,061
No, not really.
Uh, in the future,

365
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:17,146
I will give a lecture and then
discuss electrocardiograms.

366
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:20,5
And you will see,
then, that there is a potential

367
00:22:20,5 --> 00:22:24,903
difference between the left side
of your body and the right side

368
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:28,886
which is several millivolts.
So it is not as artificial as

369
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:31,401
you may think.
Actually, we'll take a

370
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:34,895
cardiogram in -- in class,
so you can see it really

371
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,55
working.
How much energy can I store in

372
00:22:37,55 --> 00:22:40,275
a capacitor?
Well, we already calculated

373
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,162
that.
Uh, we had the energy,

374
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:48,334
is it, uh  this was the plate
capacitor, one-half Q V,

375
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:53,932
and we can now substitute for,
um, , we can substitute in

376
00:22:53,932 --> 00:22:59,13
there the capacitance C,
and the C is Q divided by V,

377
00:22:59,13 --> 00:23:05,027
and so this is also one-half C
V-squared, that's one and the

378
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:09,025
same thing.
So either you take the charge

379
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:12,424
on the capacitor,
multiply it by V,

380
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:19,197
or you take the capacitance and
multiply it by V-squared.

381
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:23,174
The capacitance is never a
function of the charge that is

382
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:25,588
on the object.
V- if you look here,

383
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:28,712
the capacitance is only a
matter of geometry.

384
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:31,837
And when you look there,
the plate capacitor,

385
00:23:31,837 --> 00:23:36,098
it's only a matter of geometry,
never does the charge show up

386
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:38,938
in there.
So I mentioned that I can bring

387
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:42,063
ten microCoulombs on this
capacitor, and yet,

388
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:45,187
on the VandeGraaff,
I can also only bring ten

389
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:48,099
microCoulombs,
that's the maximum I can do

390
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:53,927
before it goes into breakdown.
We can think of a capacitor as

391
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:57,268
a device that can store,
uh, electric energy.

392
00:23:57,268 --> 00:24:01,975
I will now return to my promise
that I was going to demonstrate

393
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:05,847
to you that I have to do
positive work when I create

394
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:08,201
electric fields.
In other words,

395
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:12,832
when I take these two charged
plates, and I bring them further

396
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:16,249
away from each other,
that I do positive work.

397
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:19,134
And how am I going to show that
to you?

398
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:24,525
I have two parallel plates.
They're on the table there,

399
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:28,14
you're going to see them
shortly, projected there.

400
00:24:28,14 --> 00:24:31,239
And we have,
here, a current meter -- I put

401
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:35,297
an A in there for amperes,
symbolic for current meter --

402
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:39,355
and I'm going to have a power
supply and put a potential

403
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:43,192
difference over here,
this is the capacitance C -- we

404
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:47,767
normally  use for capacitor the
symbol of two parallel lines --

405
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:52,12
I'm going to put a potential
difference V over the capacitor

406
00:24:52,12 --> 00:24:56,891
of thousand volts.
So let me put a delta here to

407
00:24:56,891 --> 00:25:00,029
remind you that it's the
difference between the two

408
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:01,284
plates.
As I do that,

409
00:25:01,284 --> 00:25:04,233
as I connect the power supply
to these two ends,

410
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:07,433
charge will flow on here,
and so you will see a very

411
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,822
short surge of current.
So the amp meter will give you,

412
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:14,022
only for the short amount of
time that I am charging

413
00:25:14,022 --> 00:25:17,85
[wssshhht], will see you -- will
show you that there is charge

414
00:25:17,85 --> 00:25:19,732
flowing.
And you will see that.

415
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:22,87
But that's not really the goal
of my demonstration.

416
00:25:22,87 --> 00:25:27,742
What I'm now going to do is,
I'm now going to increase the

417
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:30,693
separation, the instance D of
these two plates.

418
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:34,67
And remember that the potential
difference over the capac- over

419
00:25:34,67 --> 00:25:38,648
the plates, which I call now a
capacitor, is the electric field

420
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:41,47
times the distance,
and the electric field is

421
00:25:41,47 --> 00:25:43,844
constant.
If I charge the capacitor up

422
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:46,602
with a certain charge,
there is plus Q here,

423
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:49,746
there's minus Q there,
and then I remove the power

424
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:53,082
supply, it's no longer there,
that charge is trapped,

425
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:56,738
that charge can never change.
And so if the charge doesn't

426
00:25:56,738 --> 00:26:00,19
change,
the charge surface density

427
00:26:00,19 --> 00:26:02,836
doesn't change,
and so the electric field

428
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:06,342
inside remains constant.
So exactly what we did there.

429
00:26:06,342 --> 00:26:09,253
And now I'm going to move them
further apart,

430
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:13,288
therefore I'm going to make D
larger, and that can only happen

431
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:16,992
if the potential difference
between the plates increases.

432
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,638
And I will start off with
thousand volts,

433
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:23,343
whereby D is one millimeter,
and then I will open up this

434
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:26,849
gap up to ten millimeters.
And then I have a potential

435
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:30,222
difference of ten thousand
volts.

436
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:34,05
But since the energy in the
capacitor is one-half Q times

437
00:26:34,05 --> 00:26:38,22
the potential difference V --
this V is the same as this delta

438
00:26:38,22 --> 00:26:42,185
V -- and if Q is not changing,
but if I go from V from  one

439
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:46,217
thousand volts to ten thousand
volts, it's very clear that I

440
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,61
have done work,
I have increased the

441
00:26:48,61 --> 00:26:52,848
electrostatic potential energy.
And this is what I want to show

442
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:56,676
you, we're going to have that
there -- so I've changed my

443
00:26:56,676 --> 00:27:01,461
television, and I will have to
change the lights

444
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:05,268
a little bit so that you can
see that -- well,

445
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:07,89
turn this one off,
this one off,

446
00:27:07,89 --> 00:27:12,121
and all them -- let's wait for
the light to settle,

447
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:15,42
and we want also the  the
current meter.

448
00:27:15,42 --> 00:27:20,243
So the one on the right there
is the, uh -- the amp meter,

449
00:27:20,243 --> 00:27:23,965
the current meter,
and you see here these two

450
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:28,534
plates, they are separated now
by about one millimeter.

451
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:34,965
I have here a very thin sheet,
transparency which I can move

452
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:39,028
in between to make sure that
they don't make contact -- and

453
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:41,901
here is my power supply,
and I have there,

454
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:45,964
this, uh, propeller-type thing
which is some kind of a volt

455
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,346
meter.
And if it's going to move in

456
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:51,288
this direction,
that means that the voltage

457
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:55,351
between the plates increases.
And so I'm going to charge it

458
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:59,274
now, with a potential difference
of, uh,  thousand volts,

459
00:27:59,274 --> 00:28:02,637
and as I do that,
you will see a very short surge

460
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:07,834
here on this amp meter.
That's not very spectacular,

461
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:11,177
but at least you can see,
for the first time in your

462
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:14,912
life, that charge is actually
flowing from my power supply

463
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:17,141
onto the plates.
Then you will see,

464
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:20,876
[pssshhht], and that's it.
There will only be a current as

465
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:24,415
long as the charge is flowing.
So let my first do that,

466
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:27,299
look at the amp meter there,
three, two, one,

467
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,461
zero.
That's all it took to charge

468
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:31,821
these plates.
It's now fully charged,

469
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:35,032
thousand-volt difference,
and now, as I'm going to

470
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:39,161
increase the gap,
there's no reason for any

471
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:42,645
charge to go away from the
plates, so the amp meter will

472
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:46,32
not do much, probably nothing,
but you're going to see this

473
00:28:46,32 --> 00:28:50,185
propeller which indicates the
potential difference between the

474
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:54,113
plates, you're going to see it
move, because I'm doing all this

475
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:57,535
work, I'm going from one
millimeter to ten millimeters,

476
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:01,337
I'm creating all this electric
field, and this hard work pays

477
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:05,265
off in terms of increasing the
potential from thousand volts to

478
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:07,356
ten thousand volts.
So there I go,

479
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:11,323
I'm two millimeters now,
look at the volt meter,

480
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,765
there's going -- aargh,
three millimeters,

481
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:17,159
I'm doing all this hard work
while you're doing nothing --

482
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,018
four millimeters,
I'm creating electric fields --

483
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:23,233
you should be proud of me,
I'm creating electric field,

484
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:25,556
look at that.
The electric field remains

485
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:29,01
constant between the plates,
because the charge is trapped,

486
00:29:29,01 --> 00:29:32,464
the charge can't go anywhere.
I'm not at seven millimeters,

487
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:34,965
seven thousand volts,
eight thousand volts,

488
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:38,121
I'm at nine millimeters,
nine thousand volts -- notice

489
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:41,705
that
the amp meter does nothing,

490
00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:46,095
no charge is flowing to the
plates, no charge is flowing

491
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:49,527
from the plates,
I'm not at ten millimeters,

492
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:53,597
and now I have created a huge
volume electric field,

493
00:29:53,597 --> 00:29:58,305
and the potential difference is
ten times larger than it was

494
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:00,7
before, and so,
you see that I,

495
00:30:00,7 --> 00:30:04,69
indeed, have done work.
You see it here in front of

496
00:30:04,69 --> 00:30:09,479
your own eyes.
All right, let's get this down,

497
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:14,124
and I'll take the -- bring the
lights back up,

498
00:30:14,124 --> 0.
and we go back to normal.

499
0. --> 00:30:16,809

500
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:22,074
I have here a hundred
microfarad capacitor -- it's a

501
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:28,269
dangerous baby -- and we can
charge that up to three thousand

502
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:33,534
volts, and when we do that,
we get three-tenths of a

503
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:39,109
Coulomb of charge on that
capacitor.

504
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:44,65
So the, um,  I'll give you some
numbers -- so it is one hundred

505
00:30:44,65 --> 00:30:50,191
microfarads, I'm going to put a
potential difference over it of

506
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:54,749
three thousand volts,
that gives it a charge Q of oh

507
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:59,307
point three Coulombs,
and that means that one-half C

508
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:03,329
V squared, which is the energy
that is stored,

509
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:07,619
then, in the capacitor,
is four hundred and fifty

510
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:12,067
joules.
And this will take fifteen

511
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:15,041
minutes.
And so th- I'm going to charge

512
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:19,502
it now, because at the end of
the lecture, I need a charge

513
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:24,277
capacitor for a demonstration.
And so I can show you there the

514
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:28,738
potential difference over the
capacitor, which will slowly

515
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:32,965
change, and we'll keep an eye on
it during the lecture,

516
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:36,096
and then, by the time it's
fully charged,

517
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:40,636
we will have reached the end of
the lecture and then we can

518
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:43,936
continue.
So here is, then,

519
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:47,098
this monster,
the hundred microfarad -- I

520
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:51,683
call it a monster because the
amount of energy that you can

521
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:56,11
pump in there is frightening,
it's four hundred and fifty

522
00:31:56,11 --> 00:31:58,877
joules.
And my power supply is here,

523
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,248
that will deliver,
comfortably,

524
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:05,675
the three thousand volts.
In fact, this is the voltage of

525
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:09,074
the power supply,
this is about thirty eight

526
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:12,473
hundred volts.
And so, now,

527
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:16,514
the idea is that I'm going to
charge this capacitor -- always

528
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:20,487
have to be very slow and careful
that I don't make mistakes,

529
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:24,663
because this is really a device
that could be lethal if you are

530
00:32:24,663 --> 00:32:26,818
not careful.
So I think we're OK.

531
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:30,454
Uh, the moment that I'm going
to charge this capacitor,

532
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:34,495
the reading there will show you
the potential difference over

533
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:37,256
these plates,
and it will take a long time

534
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:40,017
for that to go up to three
thousand volts.

535
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:45,666
And so I think I'm ready to go,
and I'm going to charge it now.

536
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:49,72
So you see now that the
potential difference over the

537
00:32:49,72 --> 00:32:52,371
plates is very low,
it's near zero,

538
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:56,503
but if you wait just a -- a few
seconds, you will see,

539
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:59,621
very slowly,
that, um, it is charging up,

540
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:04,065
and fifteen minutes from now,
we will be very close to the

541
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:08,041
three thousand volt mark,
and then we will return to

542
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:10,692
this.
So we'll leave it on just for

543
00:33:10,692 --> 00:33:14,901
now, while it is charging.
The idea of a photo flash is

544
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:21,465
that you charge up a capacitor,
and that you discharge it over

545
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:25,671
a light source.
So the idea being that you have

546
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:31,249
a capacitor -- let me erase some
of this -- and that we charge

547
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:35,547
the capacitor up,
put a certain amount of energy

548
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:40,303
in there, and then we dump all
that energy in a bulb.

549
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:45,149
So here is the capacitor,
we're going to charge it up,

550
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:49,538
we have a switch here,
and here is a

551
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:54,487
light bulb, and when we throw
the switch, then all the energy

552
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:59,519
will be going to the light bulb,
if this is positively charged

553
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,468
and this is negatively charged,
a current will start to flow,

554
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:07,19
and you will see a flash of
light.

555
00:34:07,19 --> 00:34:10,324
I have, here,
a capacitance of thousand

556
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:12,881
microfarad.
So C equals thousand

557
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:17,83
microfarad, I'm going to put a
potential difference over that

558
00:34:17,83 --> 00:34:24,252
capacitor of one hundred volts,
which then gives me a energy of

559
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:27,812
one-half C V squared,
which is five joules.

560
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:32,897
In fact, this is not just one
capacitor, but these are twelve

561
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:37,728
capacitors which I hooked up in
such a way that the twelve

562
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:43,068
capacitors of eighty microfarad
each are a combined capacitor of

563
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:47,645
one thousand microfarads.
And so I'm going to charge it

564
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:52,391
up, and then I'm going to
discharge the capacitor through

565
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:56,255
the light,
and then you will be able to

566
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:59,262
see some lights,
perhaps, depending on how much

567
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:02,856
energy we dump through there.
So concentrate now on this

568
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:05,601
light bulb.
The hundred volts -- you should

569
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:09,195
see here, do you see it?
-- so it's set at hundred volts

570
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:12,921
now, and I'm now going to charge
it, and the moment that I

571
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:16,254
charge, you will see the voltage
over the capacitor,

572
00:35:16,254 --> 00:35:19,064
and so it takes a while for it
to charge up,

573
00:35:19,064 --> 00:35:22,92
so it goes unintelligible down
to zero and then slowly comes

574
00:35:22,92 --> 00:35:26,384
back to a hundred,
it may take five

575
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:28,92
or ten seconds.
So if you're ready,

576
00:35:28,92 --> 00:35:32,426
then there we go.
Took only five or six seconds.

577
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:36,679
And so now we have a hundred
volts, so we have five joules

578
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:40,185
stored in there,
and I'm going to discharge that

579
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:43,244
now over this light bulb,
if you're ready,

580
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:44,811
three, two, one,
zero.

581
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:48,093
A little bit of light.
I can tell that you're

582
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:50,779
disappointed.
It's not very exciting.

583
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:53,092
It's not really my style,
is it?

584
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:56,822
Well, what we can do,
we can increase the voltage a

585
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,09
little
bit.

586
00:35:59,09 --> 00:36:02
Uh, we could go to two hundred
and fifty volts,

587
00:36:02 --> 00:36:04,72
in which case,
since it goes with V-squared,

588
00:36:04,72 --> 00:36:08,389
we would have six times more
energy, so then we have thirty

589
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:11,679
joules, so let's see whether
that's a little bit more

590
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,02
exciting.
So now I have to jack up the

591
00:36:14,02 --> 00:36:17,689
voltage to two hundred fifty
volts -- now you see the power

592
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:21,169
supply again -- two hundred
fifty volts -- we've getting

593
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:24,206
there, we don't have -- oh,
boy, huh, am I lucky,

594
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:28,001
on the button.
So two hundred fifty volts,

595
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:31,981
and noW I can charge up again,
and it will take a little

596
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,744
longer, so you'll see the
voltage over the capacitor,

597
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:37,915
hundred forty,
hundred seventy,

598
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:40,52
two hundred,
two fifty, there we are.

599
00:36:40,52 --> 00:36:44,717
And now we can see  whether we
get a little bit more light.

600
00:36:44,717 --> 00:36:48,19
So you go from five joules now,
to thirty joules.

601
00:36:48,19 --> 00:36:49,709
Three, two, one,
zero.

602
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,242
Waahaa, now we're getting
somewhere.

603
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:55,281
Now you really see how a photo
flash works.

604
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:59,985
Now, we all,
of course, have destructi-

605
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:04,165
destructive instincts.
And so you wonder  right?

606
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:08,167
You- you're thinking the same
thing that I do.

607
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:13,237
Shall we try three hundred
forty volts and see whether the

608
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:15,816
bulb [ptchee],
maybe explodes?

609
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:20,085
I don't know how high this
voltage supply can go,

610
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:23,554
let's see.
Let's - let's go all the way.

611
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:26,4
Three hundred thirty seven
volts.

612
00:37:26,4 --> 00:37:31,025
OK.
So that would mean that we

613
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:34,606
have fifty joules,
roughly.

614
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:42,321
It goes as the voltage squared.
Well, let's charge again,

615
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:47,006
so we're charging now.
Two hundred,

616
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:52,241
two eighty, three hundred,
there we go,

617
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:57,2
three hundred and thirty seven
volts.

618
00:37:57,2 --> 00:38:01,747
Now let's see -- AAAAH,
we did it!

619
00:38:01,747 --> 0.
It broke!

620
0. --> 00:38:06,018

621
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:09,606
I have a photo flash,
and I have the photo flash

622
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:14,494
here, and this photo flash has a
capacitor of about five thousand

623
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:18,846
microfarads, a real biggie,
and we can charge that up to a

624
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:21,977
potential difference of one
hundred volts,

625
00:38:21,977 --> 00:38:26,024
even though the batteries in
there are only six volts,

626
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:30,682
there is a circuit in there --
we'll learn about that later --

627
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:34,271
which converts the six volts to
a hundred volts,

628
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:39,414
and so we can charge up this
capacitor to a hundred volts.

629
00:38:39,414 --> 00:38:42,236
And that means that the
one-half C V squared,

630
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,929
the energy stored,
then, in that capacitor,

631
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:48,648
will be twenty five joules.
And I can dump that energy over

632
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:51,534
the light bulb,
and then we see a bright flash

633
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:55,06
of light, because this discharge
can occur in something,

634
00:38:55,06 --> 00:38:58,587
like, only a millisecond.
So you get a tremendous amount

635
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:00,832
of light, only for that
millisecond.

636
00:39:00,832 --> 00:39:03,204
And I want to demonstrate that
to you.

637
00:39:03,204 --> 00:39:06,474
And the only way I can
demonstrate that to you is by

638
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:11,441
aiming this flashlight you --
I don't want to damage your

639
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:15,023
eyes, so I warn you in advance
-- so I am charging up,

640
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:17,659
now, my capacitor,
it will take a while,

641
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,957
and I'm going to take your
picture.

642
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,066
I might as well.
But, um, it's going to be very

643
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:26,31
dark in the back,
there, and so I've asked Marcos

644
00:39:26,31 --> 00:39:30,23
and Bill to also have some
flashlights, which go off at the

645
00:39:30,23 --> 00:39:32,73
same time that my flashlight
goes off.

646
00:39:32,73 --> 00:39:35,704
Now, you may say,
"Well, how can you do that,

647
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:39,219
because if this flash only
lasts a

648
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:41,653
millisecond,
how can you synchronize that?"

649
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:44,783
Well, the way that's done is
that those flashlights are

650
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:48,261
waiting for my light signal to
reach them, and that goes with

651
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,58
the speed of light.
Takes way less than a

652
00:39:50,58 --> 00:39:53,652
millisecond to get there,
and they go at the same time

653
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,507
that they receive my light
flash.

654
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:57,42
And so we call them
flash-assists.

655
00:39:57,42 --> 00:39:59,971
And so let's,
uh, let's see whether we can do

656
00:39:59,971 --> 00:40:01,825
this.
I, uh, I have a green light

657
00:40:01,825 --> 00:40:04,318
here, that means I can take my
picture, and,

658
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,216
uh, yes, you can -- oh,
you don't have to comb your

659
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:10,463
hair, but -- you're looking
good.

660
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:12,72
OK, let me -- let me,
let me focus,

661
00:40:12,72 --> 00:40:16,571
because that's important -- so
make sure you see the flash.

662
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:19,294
You ready for this?
Did you see the flash?

663
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,887
Did it flash?
Oh, it did.

664
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:23,942
Oh, you can say yes.
So, um, did the -- did the

665
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:27,594
light-assists also flash?
OK, but you haven't seen that,

666
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:30,117
yet, right?
Because you were looking at

667
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:32,375
them.
You should have looked -- you

668
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:36,558
really should have looked at me.
So why don't we take a picture,

669
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:38,749
Marcos, Bill,
aim the fli- li- the

670
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:42,467
flash-assists at the students
here,

671
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:45,794
and then we'll try it again.
You ready?

672
00:40:45,794 --> 00:40:46,757
OK.
Oh, boy.

673
00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:49,997
Why don't you say cheese for a
change?

674
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:54,111
OK, look at me -- oh,
boy, you're looking great,

675
00:40:54,111 --> 00:40:57,701
you really -- unintelligible
out of focus.

676
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:02,604
Uh, one person's sleeping
there, oh, we'll let him sleep,

677
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:04,705
that's OK.
Did that work?

678
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:07,682
Did you see the flash?
You did, eh?

679
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:10,571
Twenty five -- twenty five
joules.

680
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:16,179
But those haven't seen it yet.
So Marcos, Bill,

681
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:21,04
make sure that we go this way,
and give them a chance to see

682
00:41:21,04 --> 00:41:24,501
this light flash.
So we get a little bit of

683
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:28,291
assistance there,
the lights, and let's see how

684
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,916
this works, make sure that you
see the flash,

685
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:36,86
very good, you can -- going to
see another twenty five joules

686
00:41:36,86 --> 00:41:40,815
going through this light bulb --
very good -- oh,

687
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:42,875
oh, oh, yes,
yes, uh, yes,

688
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:47,191
your hand is in front
of your mouth,

689
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:49,906
sir, yes, that's OK,
thank you.

690
00:41:49,906 --> 00:41:52,802
Very good.
Did you see the flash?

691
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:56,332
Did the f- did the -- did the
assist go?

692
00:41:56,332 --> 00:42:00,224
So that's the idea of,
um, of photo flashes.

693
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:05,473
So you dump a lot of energy in
a very short amount of time,

694
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:08,279
and you get a very bright
flash.

695
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:12,895
Professor Edgerton at MIT
became very famous for his

696
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:16,515
flashlights.
He invented flashed that can

697
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:20,788
handle
way more energy than this

698
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:25,157
flash, and they can dump that
energy in less that one

699
00:42:25,157 --> 00:42:28,686
microsecond.
And so this opened up the road

700
00:42:28,686 --> 00:42:33,224
to high-speed photography,
and that made it possible to

701
00:42:33,224 --> 00:42:38,097
study the motion of objects on
time scales of microseconds,

702
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:42,802
and even shorter than that.
And I'd like to show you some

703
00:42:42,802 --> 00:42:47,76
of the pictures that were taken
with Doc Edgerton's flashes.

704
00:42:47,76 --> 00:42:53,222
The first slide -- you see a
bullet coming from the

705
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:56,605
right going for a light bulb.
The exposure of this,

706
00:42:56,605 --> 00:42:58,906
uh, picture,
is only one-third of a

707
00:42:58,906 --> 00:43:02,764
microsecond, during which the
bullet probably moved only a

708
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:05,674
third of a millimeter,
so it looks like it's

709
00:43:05,674 --> 00:43:09,261
completely standing still.
And the bulb is heading for

710
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:11,833
disaster, but it doesn't know
that yet.

711
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:13,795
Uh, the bullet,
uh, moves, uh,

712
00:43:13,795 --> 00:43:16,976
in hundred microseconds about
eight centimeters,

713
00:43:16,976 --> 00:43:20,969
and then next picture is taken
a hundred microseconds later,

714
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:24,489
again one-third of a
microseconds

715
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:27,229
exposure.
So if we can look at that --

716
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,97
there, you see,
so the bullet now just

717
00:43:29,97 --> 00:43:33,97
penetrates the light bulb,
and then the next picture is

718
00:43:33,97 --> 00:43:38,118
another hundred microseconds
later, and there you see the

719
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:40,71
bullet emerging from the light
bulb.

720
00:43:40,71 --> 00:43:43,599
And, uh, this,
uh, light bulb has hardly

721
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,747
realized that it is broken.
But it's beginning to dawn on

722
00:43:47,747 --> 00:43:52,414
it, and  and then the next slide
is one unintelligible wonderful

723
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:57,302
picture of a boy who is popping
a balloon,

724
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:02,835
and you see half the balloon
doesn't even know yet,

725
00:44:02,835 --> 00:44:07,814
that it is broken.
Doc Edgerton also -- that's

726
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:13,678
enough for these slides -- he
also developed a lot of,

727
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:18,325
um, strobes.
A strobe -- I have one here --

728
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:23,525
is an instrument that repeatedly
discharges, um,

729
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:30,164
energy over a -- over the light
bulb, and so you get repeated

730
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:33,458
flashes,
and that, then,

731
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:35,463
gives you  instrument like
this.

732
00:44:35,463 --> 00:44:39,085
Uh, you've seen them in use --
uh, they are being used at

733
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:42,707
airplanes, just for warning
signals, and you've also seen

734
00:44:42,707 --> 00:44:46,393
them on tall towers in the
airports, also warning signals,

735
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:50,015
but there are lot of more
things you can do with strobes.

736
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:53,055
And later, in eight oh two,
uh, I will show you,

737
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:55,448
for instance,
that you can measure the

738
00:44:55,448 --> 00:44:58,1
rotation rate of motors with
flash lights,

739
00:44:58,1 --> 00:44:59,911
with these, uh,
stroboscopes,

740
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:04,791
and the motors are
going to play a more important

741
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:08,402
role in eight oh two than,
uh, than you may have guessed

742
00:45:08,402 --> 00:45:11,881
before you took this course.
You can also measure with

743
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:14,835
strobes the rotation,
the speed of your record

744
00:45:14,835 --> 00:45:18,708
player, if you still have one,
and then you can adjust it so

745
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:21,925
that it just has the right speed
that is required.

746
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:25,339
So [inaudible] lot of things
you can do with strobes,

747
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:28,621
and some of which we will see
also in eight oh two.

748
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:31,181
So, now, I return to my
capacitor there.

749
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:34,522
And let's see
how it is doing.

750
00:45:34,522 --> 00:45:38,03
Oh, boy, we are close to the
three thousand,

751
00:45:38,03 --> 00:45:41,293
which was my goal.
It takes a -- you see,

752
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:45,372
a good fifteen minutes,
to actually reach the three

753
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:50,104
thousand volts on this huge
capacitor, and to get in there,

754
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:54,591
the energy, the four hundred
fifty joules that I wanted.

755
00:45:54,591 --> 00:45:58,017
And why is it that I want to
show you this?

756
00:45:58,017 --> 00:46:02,015
Well, I want you to appreciate
the idea of a fuse.

757
00:46:02,015 --> 00:46:05,751
You have lots of fuses at
home.

758
00:46:05,751 --> 00:46:10,211
A fuse is a safety device.
A fuse is something that melts,

759
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:14,671
something that breaks if the
current that you are using is

760
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,331
too high.
Suppose you have a short,

761
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:20,07
electric short without
realizing it,

762
00:46:20,07 --> 00:46:23,748
in your desk lamp,
and a very high current could

763
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:26,643
start to flow,
then the fuse will say,

764
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:30,164
"Sorry, you can't do that,
the fuse will melt,

765
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:35,016
and then that's -- prevents you
from  a

766
00:46:35,016 --> 00:46:37,312
disaster, which,
actually, might,

767
00:46:37,312 --> 00:46:40,039
give you a fire.
And we already showed,

768
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:43,985
in a way, the idea of a fuse,
because when we broke this

769
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:46,712
light bulb, that was,
in a way, a fuse.

770
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:50,228
We dumped too much energy
through that light bulb,

771
00:46:50,228 --> 00:46:54,462
and so, the light bulb itself
[klk] was already like a fuse.

772
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:58,121
This is really more like a fuse
that we are used to,

773
00:46:58,121 --> 00:47:01,996
it is a -- we have a wire
there, which is an iron wire,

774
00:47:01,996 --> 00:47:05,8
which is twelve inches long,
and it has a thickness of

775
00:47:05,8 --> 00:47:09,301
thirty
thousandths of an inch.

776
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:13,16
And we're going to dump the
four hundred fifty joules

777
00:47:13,16 --> 00:47:16,648
through that wire.
So the idea is very much like

778
00:47:16,648 --> 00:47:21,175
we had the -- the photo flash,
we, um, have all this energy in

779
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:24,07
the capacitor,
and instead of dumping it

780
00:47:24,07 --> 00:47:27,41
through the light bulb,
which was this system,

781
00:47:27,41 --> 00:47:30,824
we now have here,
a wire, and when I throw this

782
00:47:30,824 --> 00:47:34,015
switch, the energy will go
through the wire.

783
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:37,875
And chances are that you may
see the

784
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:40,913
wire glowing a little bit,
and then it would melt,

785
00:47:40,913 --> 00:47:43,827
and that would then give you
the idea of a fuse.

786
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:47,052
And it's also possible that,
after we have done that,

787
00:47:47,052 --> 00:47:50,339
that there may still be energy
left on this capacitor,

788
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:54,059
and I can show that to you too,
then, because I can short out

789
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:57,594
the two ends of the capacitor
and see whether we still see

790
00:47:57,594 --> 00:48:00,384
some -- some sparks,
which would indicate that

791
00:48:00,384 --> 00:48:03,919
there's still some energy left.
So if you are ready -- I'm

792
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:08,26
always a little bit scared with
this demonstration --

793
00:48:08,26 --> 00:48:14,02
not so much about what's going
happen, that thing will probably

794
00:48:14,02 --> 00:48:18,851
just melt, and maybe we'll see a
little bit of light,

795
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:23,589
that's not the issue -- but I'm
afraid of this baby,

796
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:27,677
because that has,
now, a tremendous amount of

797
00:48:27,677 --> 00:48:30,929
energy.
So I stop the charging -- so

798
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:36,503
let's do that -- and if you're
ready, then I will try to dump

799
00:48:36,503 --> 00:48:39,569
all that energy through this
wire.

800
00:48:39,569 --> 00:48:41,52
Three, two, one,
zero.

801
00:48:41,52 --> 00:48:46,9
[bang] [hum] [bang].
This is the way a fuse works.

802
00:48:46,9 --> 00:48:49,177
This is very effective,
as you see.

803
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:52,324
And if you hear this happening
in your basement,

804
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:54,401
then, well, maybe that's a
fuse.

805
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:57,883
We can now check whether there
is energy left on that

806
00:48:57,883 --> 00:48:59,892
capacitor.
Maybe not very much,

807
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:03,241
but it's unlikely that
everything was dumped in the

808
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:06,255
iron, so let's see whether there
is some left,

809
00:49:06,255 --> 00:49:09,469
if I'm going to be able to
short it out with this

810
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:12,349
conducting bar,
and see whether we can get a

811
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,848
spark.
And we can.

812
00:49:14,848 --> 00:49:17,119
So there's still some energy
left.

813
00:49:17,119 --> 49:22
OK, see you Friday.
