1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,869



2
00:00:00,869 --> 00:00:08,509
We see last time that using
Biot and Savart's formula that

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:15,881
if you have a current going
straight into the blackboard

4
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:24,325
perpendicular to the blackboards
that we get a magnetic field at

5
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:30,223
a distance R.
The magnetic field tangentially

6
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:34,429
to
the circle, B here,

7
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:43,198
B here, and then the strength
of that magnetic field equals mu

8
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:47,798
zero times I divided by two pi
R.

9
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:54,699
If you walk around this circle,
just walk around,

10
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:03,18
and you carve up this circle in
little elements DL,

11
00:01:03,18 --> 00:01:08,705
and you calculate the closed
circle integral,

12
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:15,986
so the closed circle of B dot
DL, so everywhere locally you

13
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:21,636
dot B with DL,
the B and DL are in exactly the

14
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:28,541
same direction everywhere,
then you would find that this

15
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:36,327
obviously is B times two pi R.
But B times two pi R equals

16
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:41,784
also mu zero times I.
This DL here has nothing to do

17
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:46,063
with this DL here.
Don't confuse the two.

18
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:52,056
This DL is a small amount of
length in the wire that goes

19
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:56,657
into the blackboard which
carries a current.

20
00:01:56,657 --> 00:02:02,969
This DL is simply your DL when
you walk around this  current

21
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,731
wire.
It doesn't matter at what

22
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:12,645
distance you walk around.
You always get mu zero times I.

23
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:17,91
You see it right in front of
your eyes because B is inversely

24
00:02:17,91 --> 00:02:21,859
proportional to R.
And it was Ampere who first

25
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:27,036
recognized that you don't have
to walk around in a circle to

26
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:31,862
get the answer mu zero I,
but that you could walk around

27
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:36,25
in any crooked path as long as
it is a closed path,

28
00:02:36,25 --> 00:02:40,725
something like this.
And now you have here the local

29
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:44,359
B,
which of course is

30
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:51,551
perpendicular to this radius and
here you have your local DL and

31
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:56,688
if now you go around,
closed circled any path,

32
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:03,31
it doesn't have to be a circle,
dot DL  that now becomes mu

33
00:03:03,31 --> 00:03:08,333
zero times I,
which is known as Ampere's Law,

34
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:15,525
and I then is often given an
index and closed.

35
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:19,268
It is the current which is
enclosed by that path.

36
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:23,636
It is actually easy to prove
this using Biot and Savart's

37
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,132
formalism.
This is almost a third

38
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:30,031
Maxwell's equation.
We already had two out of four.

39
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:32,995
This is almost number three,
not quite.

40
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,881
We're going to amend it in the
future.

41
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:40,482
What is ill-defined a little
bit in this equation is what we

42
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:43,992
mean by enclosed,
and I'm going to define that

43
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:48,36
now so uniquely that there is
never any

44
00:03:48,36 --> 00:03:52,036
misunderstanding.
If I have a very strange

45
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:57,596
looking closed path that I have
chosen, that's the path I walk,

46
00:03:57,596 --> 00:04:01,721
I have to attach to that closed
loop a surface,

47
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,68
an open surface.
That's mandatory.

48
00:04:04,68 --> 00:04:07,639
You can make it flat.
That's fine.

49
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,571
You're free to choose it.
You can also make it sort of a

50
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:19,297
plastic bag so it's open here.
You can put your hands in here,

51
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:22,372
and here, like a hat.
Any surface is fine,

52
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:25,522
but you must attach to that
loop a surface,

53
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:29,347
so here I have some paths that
you could be walking,

54
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:33,172
and this would be perfectly
fine open- open surface.

55
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,173
Could be flat,
but it could also be open,

56
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:39,773
so it's like a hat.
And now I can define uniquely

57
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:43,523
what it means by- what it means
by this I enclosed,

58
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:48,098
because if now I have a current
that goes through this surface

59
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:52,844
and pokes out here,
then I have a current

60
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:57,909
penetrating the surface and that
is uniquely defined,

61
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:03,266
and if I have another one
coming in through the surface,

62
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:07,454
for I two, this is penetrating
that surface.

63
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:11,447
By convention,
if you go clockwise around,

64
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:15,928
we follow the same notation
that we had before,

65
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:20,701
in the right-hand corkscrew
notation,

66
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:24,932
the connection between magnetic
field and current.

67
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:28,905
If you go around clockwise seen
from this side,

68
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:33,136
so you go clockwise,
then I one as I have it here,

69
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:37,454
the new equation would have to
be larger than zero.

70
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:40,132
I two is then smaller than
zero.

71
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,672
But if you decided to go
counterclockwise,

72
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:48,077
which is perfectly fine,
Ampere's law doesn't at all

73
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:52,481
dictate in which direction you
have to march around,

74
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:58,258
then I one would be negative
and then I two would be

75
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,217
positive.
So we follow the right-hand

76
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:05,326
corkscrew notation.
And so if you want to amend now

77
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:10,258
Ampere's Law to do me a favor,
but you don't do books a favor

78
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:13,792
because all the books use the
word enclosed.

79
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:17,737
I would like to see this
replaced by penetration.

80
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:22,505
It is the penetration of the
surface of the current that is

81
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:26,121
uniquely defined.
But a current enclosed by a

82
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:31,052
loop is ill-defined.
Because where possible,

83
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:35,219
when we apply Ampere's Law,
we will try to find easy passes

84
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:38,524
around circles sometimes,
sometimes rectangles,

85
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:42,26
and since you are free to
choose the surface that you

86
00:06:42,26 --> 00:06:46,571
attach to the loop if you can
get away with it you use a flat

87
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:50,881
surface, but you can not always
get away with a flat surface.

88
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:54,904
So the recipe is as follows.
You choose your closed loop.

89
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:58,425
Any loop is allowed.
It may not help you very much

90
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:03,095
if you choose the wrong loop.
Any loop is allowed.

91
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:06,855
You then attach an open surface
to that loop.

92
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:11,726
And I penetrate is now the
current that penetrates through

93
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:15,315
that surface,
according to this convention.

94
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:19,075
And the direction of rotation
is free to you.

95
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:23,946
How you go around to pass is
your choice, but that defines

96
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:27,792
then the sign of the penetrating
of the curve,

97
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:33,262
of the- of the current,
according to the right-hand

98
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:35,567
corkscrew.
So now we can,

99
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:40,082
for the first time,
calculate the magnetic field

100
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:45,174
inside a wire that draws a
current using Ampere's Law.

101
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:50,842
I have here a wire that has a
radius capital R and a current

102
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:55,069
is coming to me,
I, and let's assume that the

103
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:00,833
current is uniformly throughout
the wire, so it has a uniform

104
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:05,935
current density.
And I would like to know what

105
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,489
the magnetic field is
everywhere.

106
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:12,96
The cylindrical symmetry,
I want to know outside the wire

107
00:08:12,96 --> 00:08:15,674
and I want to know inside the
wire.

108
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:19,586
Let's first look at radius
which is larger than R,

109
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:23,577
and so here we have the
cross-section of that wire,

110
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:26,691
radius R.
The current I is going through

111
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:30,043
this surface.
I now have to choose a closed

112
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,438
path.
Since we have cylindrical

113
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:36,59
symmetry it is clear that we
would

114
00:08:36,59 --> 00:08:39,586
choose the circle,
with radius little R,

115
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:43,888
so we can be sure that the
magnetic field strength is the

116
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:47,421
same everywhere because of
reasons of symmetry.

117
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:51,57
Since the current is coming
towards me and I am free to

118
00:08:51,57 --> 00:08:54,95
choose in which direction I'm
going to march,

119
00:08:54,95 --> 00:08:58,868
I know that the magnetic field
is in this direction,

120
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:03,554
so I might as well also march
in this direction so that my DLs

121
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:08,605
are all in this direction.
I don't have to do that.

122
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:12,486
I could march the other way
around, but if I march

123
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:17,397
counterclockwise then both terms
left and right of Ampere's Law

124
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:20,961
will be positive.
I now have to attach an open

125
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,971
surface to my path.
Well, this will be,

126
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:27,219
the blackboard will be,
that open surface.

127
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:31,576
And so now I apply Ampere's
Law, so I get B times two pi

128
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:36,408
little R, because DL and B are
in the same direction so it's a

129
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:40,051
trivial integral.
That now equals mu zero times

130
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:43,607
I,
which now penetrates my

131
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:46,008
surface.
Uniquely determined,

132
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:51,152
all these currents from this
wire that comes to me penetrates

133
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:55,781
my surface, so times I,
and so B equals mu zero times I

134
00:09:55,781 --> 00:10:00,153
divided by two pi R,
and that's the same result that

135
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:03,84
we found last time,
when we applied Biot and

136
00:10:03,84 --> 00:10:07,012
Savart.
So that's no surprise that you

137
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:11,47
see this, because now we have a
way of

138
00:10:11,47 --> 00:10:15,303
finding the magnetic field also
inside the wire,

139
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:19,299
so here we have the wire again,
the cross-section,

140
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:23,622
current coming out of the
blackboard, and now I want a

141
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:28,027
radius which is smaller than
capital R and of course my

142
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:32,757
closed pass again for reasons
for symmetry is going to be a

143
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,999
circle with radius R.
And my surface that I attach is

144
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,609
a flat surface,
and so here I go,

145
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:43,524
B times two pi little R equals
mu

146
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:46,791
zero times- ah,
now I have to be careful,

147
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:51,285
because now not the full
current I is now penetrating my

148
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:55,615
surface, but it is only a
fraction that penetrates the

149
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,435
surface, and the fraction that
penetrates the surface is now

150
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:04,765
little R squared divided by
capital R squared times I.

151
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:09,503
You see, because the total
current comes through the radius

152
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:15,548
capital R, but I only have now a
circle with radius little R.

153
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:21,004
And so I lose one R here and so
we get a very different result.

154
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:26,284
You get now that the magnetic
field equals mu zero times I is

155
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:31,388
now linear in little R divided
by two pi capital R squared.

156
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:36,668
And this grows linearly with R,
whereas this falls off as one

157
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:39,836
over R.
And if you substitute in this

158
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:44,324
equation R equals capital R,
which then would be the

159
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:48,543
magnetic
field right at the surface of

160
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:52,388
the wire, you find exactly the
same result here.

161
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:57,132
Little R becomes a capital R.
If little R becomes a capital

162
00:11:57,132 --> 00:12:01,303
R, you lose one capital R,
you get the  same result.

163
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:06,211
And so if you make a plot of
the magnetic field as a function

164
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:11,2
of little R, then it looks like-
like so, so this is little R,

165
00:12:11,2 --> 00:12:15,126
this is capital R,
and this is the magnetic field

166
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:20,769
strength because we know that it
is tangentially

167
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:25,347
to the circles.
It would be straight line and

168
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:31,381
then here it falls off as one
over R, and the maximum value

169
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:37,935
here is the value that you find
there if you substitute little R

170
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:42,513
equals capital R.
I will now show you that we

171
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:47,402
can, using Ampere's Law,
also come very close to

172
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:53,051
calculating the magnetic
field inside what we call

173
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,943
solenoids.
Solenoids is like a slinky

174
00:12:55,943 --> 00:13:00,762
current that goes around in a
spiral, one loop after another.

175
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:05,741
I want to remind you that if we
had a loop, a nice current loop

176
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:10,56
coming out of the blackboard
here, and the current going into

177
00:13:10,56 --> 00:13:15,058
the blackboard so there's a
circular wire but I only show

178
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:19,154
you the cross-section.
I want to remind you that the

179
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:23,09
magnetic field as we discussed
last

180
00:13:23,09 --> 00:13:28,069
time, would be clockwise here,
would be counterclockwise here.

181
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,416
In the middle,
remember, it was like this.

182
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,191
And then in-between it was like
so.

183
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:38,681
That was sort of the magnetic
field configuration in the

184
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:43,252
vicinity of a loop through which
we have a current going.

185
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:47,007
But now imagine that you put
another loop here,

186
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:51,578
current again coming out of the
blackboard going into the

187
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:56,721
blackboard, and another one,
and so on, several.

188
00:13:56,721 --> 00:14:01,811
What do you think is going to
happen with these magnetic field

189
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:06,233
lines which now diverge?
They're going to be sucked in

190
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,154
here.
This loop also wants the field

191
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:12,909
lines to come through its
circle, so to speak,

192
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:16,831
and this one too,
and so you're beginning to get

193
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,004
a near-constant magnetic field
and the more tightly these loops

194
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:26,76
are wound, the more accurately
will your magnetic field be

195
00:14:26,76 --> 00:14:31,267
approximately constant,
and I have some

196
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:35,727
transparencies which will show
that in more detail.

197
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:38,938
Here we have a figure from your
book.

198
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:41,704
You see five windings,
a spiral.

199
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:46,075
If you look from the left,
the current is going in

200
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:50,357
clockwise direction,
and so the magnetic field is

201
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,747
going from this side to that
direction.

202
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:58,743
And when you look here you see
that the magnetic field is

203
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:02,474
approximately
constant inside,

204
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:06,789
and outside these current
loops, outside the solenoids --

205
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:11,182
we call them solenoids --
magnetic field is extremely low.

206
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:14,959
And if you start winding these
loops very tightly,

207
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,349
then you get a configuration
looks like this.

208
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:22,588
You get an almost perfect
constant magnetic field inside

209
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,212
the solenoids and the magnetic
field outside the solenoids is

210
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:30,141
extremely weak.
And now I would like to

211
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:35,664
calculate
with you using Ampere's Law

212
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:43,123
what that magnetic field inside
such a solenoid would be.

213
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:48,052
And we have to make a few
assumptions.

214
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:55,245
Let this be my solenoid,
and the length of the solenoid

215
00:15:55,245 --> 00:16:00,706
is capital L.
A current I is going through

216
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:05,838
like so.
I, and I assume that if I look

217
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:10,944
from the left side that the
windings are wound clockwise,

218
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:16,322
so I know that the magnetic
field is then in this direction.

219
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:21,428
I make the assumption that the
magnetic field outside the

220
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:26,806
solenoid is approximately zero.
I will show you later with a

221
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:31,638
demonstration that that's a
pretty good approximation.

222
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:37,886
And so the question now is,
what is the magnetic field

223
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:41,407
there.
And I assume I have N loops,

224
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:46,896
N windings, capital N.
So now I have to choose a path.

225
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:51,556
I have to apply Ampere's Law.
I choose a pass,

226
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:56,838
and you may be surprised the
path I'm going to take.

227
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:01,291
This is the path I choose.
It's a rectangle.

228
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:08,022
And the length of this side
inside the solenoid is L.

229
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:11,647
And I think of this as four
different passes.

230
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:14,613
Number one, number two,
number three,

231
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:18,484
and number four.
Let's first look at number two.

232
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:22,85
We have assumed that the
magnetic field is practically

233
00:17:22,85 --> 00:17:27,463
zero, so clearly if you go to
integrals, you'd go around,

234
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,676
then the contribution here must
be zero.

235
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:35,536
If the magnetic field is zero,
then the integral B dot DL is

236
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:40,321
zero, so that's easy.
But if you look at one and

237
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:44,449
three, there is no magnetic
field, very small magnetic field

238
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:47,178
outside.
The magnetic field inside is in

239
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:50,327
this direction.
But DL is like this if I march

240
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:54,806
like this, and B is like this so
there's ninety degree angles and

241
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:58,514
so the dot product is zero.
And so the only paths that

242
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:02,713
contribute to my closed-loop
integral of Ampere's Law is only

243
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:06,701
path four, and that tells me
then that B times little L --

244
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:11,35
because B is constant,
I have assumed that it is

245
00:18:11,35 --> 00:18:15,409
constant, and I integrate it
over a length little L.

246
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:18,035
Now I have to agree on my
surface.

247
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:22,571
What surface am I going to
choose to attach to that closed

248
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:25,038
loop?
Well, why not using a flat

249
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,585
surface just like the
blackboard?

250
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:32,041
Now, I have to calculate the
current that penetrates that

251
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,826
surface.
The current that penetrates

252
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:38,169
that surface,
I have to know how many times

253
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:42,785
this winding pokes through that
surface.

254
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:47,161
If the length of my rectangle
is little L and is if the length

255
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:51,393
of the solenoid is capital L,
and if there are N windings on

256
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:55,698
capital L, this is the number of
times that the current pokes

257
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:58,424
through that surface,
uniquely defined.

258
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:01,867
I have a surface now.
There is no such thing as I

259
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:04,163
enclosed.
There is I penetrating,

260
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:06,889
through that surface.
It's a soap film,

261
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:11,265
and I poke straight through it,
and I do it so many times that

262
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:14,129
I
poke through it,

263
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:18,356
and then I have to multiply
this by mu zero,

264
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:23,074
and then I have my I,
but each time that it pokes

265
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:28,578
through I have current I.
And so what you see now is that

266
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:33,001
B equals mu zero times I times N
divided by L,

267
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:38,801
and so that is our prediction
for approximating the constant

268
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:44,207
magnetic field inside a
solenoid, and this actually is a

269
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:49,514
very good
approximation as long as L,

270
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:55,719
the length of the solenoid,
is substantially larger than

271
00:19:55,719 --> 00:20:02,149
the radius of the solenoid.
The radius would be the radius

272
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:06,662
of these loops.
I'll work out a numerical

273
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:12,416
example which is aimed at a
demonstration that comes

274
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:16,815
shortly.
We have here a solenoid whereby

275
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,659
N is
about twenty-eight hundred and

276
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:24,533
L is about sixty centimeters,
that is oh point six meters,

277
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:28,475
and I'm going to run through
there a current which I really

278
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:32,349
don't know yet but is going to
be close to four and a half

279
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:35,679
amperes, we will see when we do
the demonstration.

280
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,825
And so I can calculate now what
the magnetic field is going to

281
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:42,067
be.
So the magnetic field strength

282
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:45,534
is going to be four pi times ten
to the minus seven,

283
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:49,679
because that's what mu zero is,
and then I have to multiply it

284
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,73
by
twenty-eight hundred.

285
00:20:52,73 --> 00:20:56,356
I have to multiply it,
divide it by point six,

286
00:20:56,356 --> 00:21:00,707
and then I multiply it by the
current, four point five,

287
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:05,058
and when I do that I find about
point oh two six Tesla.

288
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:09,247
Point oh two six Tesla,
that is about two hundred and

289
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,631
sixty Gauss.
And when we do the experiment,

290
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:17,385
the current will be a little
different but you will see that

291
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:21,333
indeed the field will be very
close

292
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,516
to two hundred and sixty Gauss.
Why is it that the magnetic

293
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:28,978
field is not proportional to the
number of loops,

294
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:32,945
but proportional to the number
of loops per unit length?

295
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:36,119
You may say well,
if I have one loop I have a

296
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,725
certain magnetic field,
two loops I have twice that

297
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:43,043
magnetic field,
ten loops I have ten times that

298
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:46,217
magnetic field.
Well, imagine that we start a

299
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:50,04
solenoid [inaudible] seven.
And so here is [inaudible]

300
00:21:50,04 --> 00:21:53,694
seven,
and here is that solenoid.

301
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:55,69
There it goes,
all the way,

302
00:21:55,69 --> 00:21:58,683
all the way,
thousands and thousands and

303
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:02,828
thousands and thousands of
loops, and we end up here in

304
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:05,975
twenty-six one hundred.
Look at this loop.

305
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:10,196
Think of it at the first loop.
Creates a magnetic field.

306
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,266
What is the shape of that
magnetic field?

307
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:17,564
Well, it is a current loop and
as we discussed last time,

308
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:21,939
the magnetic field that one
loop produces is like a dipole

309
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:25,526
field.
So do you really think that

310
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:29,466
here in twenty-six one hundred
we can sense the magnetic field

311
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:32,243
that is produced by this one
dinky toy loop?

312
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:35,086
Practically nothing!
It falls off so rapidly,

313
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:38,315
the magnetic field,
that we don't notice it- notice

314
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,576
it here.
So it's immediately obvious

315
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:44,452
that the magnetic field is not
proportional to how many loops

316
00:22:44,452 --> 00:22:45,808
you have.
If, however,

317
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:48,651
you put all those loops on top
of each other,

318
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:51,622
then of course you can add the
magnetic fields.

319
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:55,046
And so it is natural that you
get

320
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:59,275
how many windings you have pre
unit length.

321
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:05,619
So now I want to first show you
the magnetic field configuration

322
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:10,05
of a very loosely wound loop,
seven windings,

323
00:23:10,05 --> 00:23:14,381
and I will do that by
sprinkling magnetites,

324
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:17,502
this iron file,
in the vicinity.

325
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:22,94
We've done this before for
other current configuration.

326
00:23:22,94 --> 00:23:29,688
Now we'll do it for this
solenoid with seven windings,

327
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:33,962
and I'm going to run a few
hundred amperes through there,

328
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,634
have to first get this car
battery .

329
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:39,61
All right.
And so we put some iron files

330
00:23:39,61 --> 00:23:44,038
on here and what I want you to
see now is that the magnetic

331
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,243
field inside,
even though it's very loosely

332
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:51,747
wound, begins to look nicely
uniform and that there's almost

333
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:54,724
no electric- er,
magnetic field outside.

334
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:59,075
Look at this,
isn't that wonderful?

335
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:02,805
Isn't that incredible?
You see how these iron files

336
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:07,206
line themselves up very nicely
horizontally inside the loops

337
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:10,787
and when you look outside the
loop here or there,

338
00:24:10,787 --> 00:24:14,443
where we assume the magnetic
field was about zero,

339
00:24:14,443 --> 00:24:18,471
you don't see the iron file
being where we ended in any

340
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:21,754
preferred direction,
which indicates that the

341
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:25,857
magnetic field is very low.
Now, I want to show you what

342
00:24:25,857 --> 00:24:30,482
magnetic field we can get with
this baby, which is exactly what

343
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:34,014
I had
here on the blackboards.

344
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:38,661
It has twenty-eight hundred
windings, and we're going to run

345
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:43,15
a current which is something
like four point five amperes,

346
00:24:43,15 --> 00:24:46,773
but I'm going to tell you what
that current is,

347
00:24:46,773 --> 00:24:51,657
because I have a current meter
there for you and I also have a-

348
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,122
a meter which indicates the
magnetic  fields.

349
00:24:55,122 --> 00:24:59,69
The lower one is the current
meter, and the maximum current

350
00:24:59,69 --> 00:25:04,259
that you see there at the three
would

351
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:07,486
be six amperes.
And the upper one is calibrated

352
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:11,625
in such a way that if it is full
scale, you would have three

353
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,59
hundred Gauss,
so it's three,

354
00:25:13,59 --> 00:25:17,308
it's three hundred Gauss.
And I can -- I have a probe,

355
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,027
a magnetic probe -- we never
discussed how that works.

356
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:24,745
We call it a Hall probe,
and this Hall probe allows me

357
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:29,095
to measure the magnetic field in
the vicinity of this solenoid.

358
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:32,884
It's even sign sensitive.
If the magnetic field is like

359
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:38,212
this, it would go to the right.
If the magnetic field is like

360
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:41,728
this, it would go to the left.
And so this allows us,

361
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:45,447
then, to be actually quite
quantitative and evaluate the

362
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:48,693
magnetic field near the opening
of the solenoids.

363
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:52,547
Then we can go in there and we
can also probe the outside.

364
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:55,657
So I'm running now a current.
Let's look at it,

365
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:59,106
that's the bottom meter.
So that is about four point

366
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:01,878
eight amperes.
I assumed it was four point

367
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:03,636
five.
It's a little higher.

368
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:07,355
And here comes this probe,
and I'm now about a foot away

369
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:10,032
from
the entrance,

370
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:13,603
and you see nothing.
And I come closer to the

371
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:17,336
entrance and the magnetic field
begins to show.

372
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:21,88
Nowhere nearly constant yet.
I'm now entering one hundred

373
00:26:21,88 --> 00:26:23,99
Gauss.
I'm going in deeper.

374
00:26:23,99 --> 00:26:26,425
Two hundred Gauss.
Even deeper.

375
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:30,726
And deeper, and now I have
about two hundred and forty

376
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:33,647
Gauss and notice,
as I go in farther,

377
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:38,84
it doesn't increase.
It's more or less constant.

378
00:26:38,84 --> 00:26:41,45
Amazing, that it's more or less
constant.

379
00:26:41,45 --> 00:26:45,038
And when I come out here,
I move it back and forth about

380
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,038
twenty centimeters.
If I came in from the other

381
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:51,235
side, you would simply see a
reversal in the sign,

382
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,888
which is not so interesting,
so you see two hundred forty

383
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:58,215
Gauss with the other direction
because this probe is

384
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:01,216
sign-sensitive.
I can now also show you that if

385
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:04,738
I come on the outside of the
solenoid, you see nothing.

386
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:08,652
So indeed, our assumption that
the magnetic field is very low

387
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:14,12
outside a tightly
wound solenoid was a very good

388
00:27:14,12 --> 00:27:16,303
assumption.
Very well.

389
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:21,398
You've been asked,
and the deadline is Friday four

390
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:24,621
p.
., to explain the behavior of

391
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:30,028
the Kelvin water dropper.
And I decided to give you a

392
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:35,747
little bit of help on that.
Most of you may already have

393
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:40,426
figured it out,
but those who haven't probably

394
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:46,727
won't figure it out between
now and Friday anyhow,

395
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:51,083
so I might as well tell you.
That water dropper,

396
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:56,088
called the Kelvin water
dropper, is an amazing battery.

397
00:27:56,088 --> 00:28:00,259
We've seen it before.
We know what it's doing,

398
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:05,727
but I will go over that again.
We have here buckets A and B.

399
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:10,083
Water comes down from above,
water runs through.

400
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,419
You see the water there,
it runs out.

401
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:17,682
And we collect these water
drops

402
00:28:17,682 --> 00:28:20,303
here in bucket D,
it's a conductor,

403
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:24,928
and this water is collected in
bucket C, is also a conductor,

404
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:27,779
and the paint can A is
connected to C.

405
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,631
That's crucial.
And the paint can B is

406
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:34,177
connected with D.
And here there are two bowls,

407
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:36,643
which I can bring close
together.

408
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:39,957
I run water,
and after a while I see a spark

409
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:42,732
here.
I can even see a spark when the

410
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:47,356
distance is something like six
millimeters,

411
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:52,721
which would be about potential
difference of about twenty

412
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,307
kilovolts.
How does it work?

413
00:28:55,307 --> 00:29:00,864
Well, water has a pH of seven.
And that means one in ten to

414
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:05,653
the seven molecules is ionized.
So I have OH minus,

415
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:10,251
and I have H plus.
And the- Those are going to be

416
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:14,85
the current carriers.
The ions are doing the work

417
00:29:14,85 --> 00:29:20,98
here, are doing the job.
Let us make an enlargement

418
00:29:20,98 --> 00:29:24,104
here of can A.
And can A, let us assume that

419
00:29:24,104 --> 00:29:27,59
purely by chance,
it has a little bit of positive

420
00:29:27,59 --> 00:29:30,06
charge on it.
It could be negative,

421
00:29:30,06 --> 00:29:33,11
but I'll just assume it's
positive for now.

422
00:29:33,11 --> 00:29:36,088
In either case it will work,
you will see.

423
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:39,284
Just by chance,
like you have a little bit of

424
00:29:39,284 --> 00:29:42,262
net charge.
You're not completely neutral.

425
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:46,402
And so this can has a little
bit of positive extra charge.

426
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:50,251
Now here is the drop from the
spout.

427
00:29:50,251 --> 00:29:53,06
What's going to happen?
Through induction,

428
00:29:53,06 --> 00:29:56,623
through polarization,
you get a little bit of excess-

429
00:29:56,623 --> 00:30:00,87
excess negative charge here and
a little bit of excess positive

430
00:30:00,87 --> 00:30:04,432
there, because the positive
repels each other and the

431
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:08,474
negative is being attracted.
So the H plus goes a little bit

432
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,42
up and the OH minus comes a
little bit down.

433
00:30:11,42 --> 00:30:14,708
But now the drop breaks,
and there goes the drop.

434
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:18,887
So it's a little bit negative.
So now a little bit of negative

435
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:23,134
drops come down and so this
becomes negative.

436
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:26,678
But this is connected with B,
so B becomes negative.

437
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:30,707
But what do you think is going
to happen now with the drops

438
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,764
that fall through B?
They are going to become

439
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:37,446
positive, because if B is
negative then of course this

440
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:40,572
will be reversed,
the bottom will be positive,

441
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,462
the top will be negative,
and so those drops now that are

442
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:47,658
going to fall through are going
to be positive.

443
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:50,993
So C becomes positive.
But C is connected with A,

444
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:56,114
so A becomes more positive,
and so A can do even a better

445
00:30:56,114 --> 00:31:00,173
job now on these water drops,
and polarize them even more,

446
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:02,452
and so you get a runaway
process.

447
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:06,368
And the whole system feeds on
itself until the potential

448
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:10,356
difference here becomes so high
that you exceed the three

449
00:31:10,356 --> 00:31:14,272
million volts per meter,
and there you get the breakdown

450
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,334
and you see a spark.
Now, you can think of a

451
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:21,464
continuous stream of water as a
stream of individual drops,

452
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:25,096
so it also works if you just
have a

453
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:28,064
regular stream of water going
down.

454
00:31:28,064 --> 00:31:32,78
Who is doing the work here?
Someone has to do the work.

455
00:31:32,78 --> 00:31:36,884
You have a battery.
The battery's being charged,

456
00:31:36,884 --> 00:31:40,202
and then it is discharged to
the spark.

457
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,909
Who is doing the work?
Any idea?

458
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,791
Have you thought about that?
Yeah?

459
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,363
Gravity.
Very good.

460
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,419
It's gravity that is doing the
work.

461
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:55,745
We can see that very easily by
identifying the current that is

462
00:31:55,745 --> 00:32:02,174
flowing and the electric field.
How is the current flowing?

463
00:32:02,174 --> 00:32:06,451
If negative charge is going
down, would we all agree that

464
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:10,346
the current is going up?
If positive charge is going

465
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:14,012
down, do we agree that the
current is going down?

466
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:18,136
This side of the spout,
here, will be slightly positive

467
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:22,413
and this is slightly negative,
because the H plus is more

468
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:26,384
abundant here than there,
and so we're going to get a

469
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:29,745
current through the water,
in this direction.

470
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:33,622
Current has a reasonable
conductivity,

471
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:37,289
because it's ionized one out of
ten to the seven molecules,

472
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,198
and so once in a while if you
see a spark here,

473
00:32:40,198 --> 00:32:43,677
then you get a current there,
but that's intermittent of

474
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:46,016
course.
How about the electric fields?

475
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:49,242
Well, electric fields we know
go from plus to minus,

476
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:52,087
so that's easy.
We can put the electric fields

477
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:55,123
just in like that.
Electric field must here be in

478
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,969
this direction.
Electric fields here goes from

479
00:32:57,969 --> 00:33:00,119
plus to minus.
C is to plus charge,

480
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,546
B is minus charge,
and so the electric field is in

481
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:07,766
this direction.
Electric field is from plus to

482
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:09,125
minus.
This is plus,

483
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,059
this is minus,
so the electric field is in

484
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,279
this direction.
Electric field is from plus to

485
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,355
minus.
The can A was positive,

486
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:20,074
remember?
So the electric field is from

487
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:23,079
plus to minus.
So that's the electric field

488
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:26,228
configuration.
But now look what's happening.

489
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:29,663
Here, the E field and the
current are in the same

490
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:31,237
direction.
That's fine.

491
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:34,958
Here the E field and the
current are also in the same

492
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:38,173
direction.
That's great,

493
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:40,799
but now look at these poor
negative ions.

494
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,607
These negative ions don't want
to go in the direction of E.

495
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:48,153
Negative charge wants to go
against the direction of E.

496
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,845
But gravity says,
"Sorry, you can't do it.

497
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:53,996
I force you down.
And so these negative drops are

498
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:57,805
forced by gravity to go down.
Look at this positive charge.

499
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:01,284
These poor water drops which
are positively charged go

500
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:04,436
against the electric field.
They don't want that.

501
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:07,981
Positive charges want to go
with the

502
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:10,014
electric field.
Gravity says,

503
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,772
"Sorry, it's too bad.
I force you down.

504
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:16,038
And so gravity is doing the
work, so to speak,

505
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:18,287
against the will of the
charges.

506
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:22,279
And then the battery charges up
and charges up until the

507
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:26,851
potential difference becomes so
high there that you see a spark,

508
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:30,916
and you deal with potential
differences of something like

509
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,601
twenty  kilovolts.
Remember last time,

510
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:37,811
and you will see that again
today,

511
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:41,662
that as the water goes through
and as the system charges up,

512
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,644
that you begin to see that the
water which starts running like

513
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:48,059
so, begins to spread out.
It fans out.

514
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:52,106
You can hear it by changing the
sound, but you can also see it,

515
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:54,456
and I'll make you see it again
today.

516
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:56,806
Why is that?
Well, that's immediately

517
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:58,96
obvious.
If this can is positively

518
00:34:58,96 --> 00:35:01,963
charged but if the water is
negatively charged,

519
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:05,618
the negative charge wants to go
through the positive can,

520
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:09,013
and so it spreads out.
So it's clear that by the time

521
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:12,603
that
you reach almost a spark,

522
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:17,537
that that water will spread out
quite substantially and you will

523
00:35:17,537 --> 00:35:20,122
see that.
And then when there is a

524
00:35:20,122 --> 00:35:24,195
discharge, it will start running
again narrow stream,

525
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:27,72
and then slowly in time the
water will spread.

526
00:35:27,72 --> 00:35:32,185
And so now I will do a series
of demonstrations which will

527
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:36,179
support what we know and what we
perhaps don't know.

528
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:40,722
Let's first give a little bit
of light here,

529
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:45,608
because we will need that,
and then I'm going to make it

530
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:49,073
completely dark,
so that you get maximum

531
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:53,87
pleasure for your money.
And I will first show you here

532
00:35:53,87 --> 00:35:59,467
the- the gap those two bowls and
this time we have a real treat,

533
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:03,82
which we owe to Marcos,
who is standing behind the

534
00:36:03,82 --> 00:36:08,35
instrument very modestly.
This time we have a gauge,

535
00:36:08,35 --> 00:36:13,325
a meter, which measures the
electric fields very close to

536
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:17,943
can A,
and the reason why that is nice

537
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:23,27
is that as this system charges
up, we just don't have to wait

538
00:36:23,27 --> 00:36:28,064
now just until we see the spark,
but we can look at the

539
00:36:28,064 --> 00:36:33,48
galvanometer there and slowly
see it being charged up and then

540
00:36:33,48 --> 00:36:38,275
we get a spark and then it
discharges, so you get a lot

541
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:42,448
more for your money.
So I propose that the first

542
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:47,952
thing we do is what we did last
time, that we simply let it run

543
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:54,87
and see whether we get a spark.
Uh, there's always air bubbles

544
00:36:54,87 --> 00:36:58,474
in the system which I have to
get out.

545
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:03,248
OK, I think I get that.
OK, let's just be patient.

546
00:37:03,248 --> 00:37:07,729
Ah, it starts already.
Look at the- look at the

547
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:08,995
e-field.
Bang!

548
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:12,892
First spark.
Can you see the spark on the

549
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:15,23
screen?
Look at it again.

550
00:37:15,23 --> 00:37:19,516
There's a spark.
And at the same time you see

551
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:24,271
how the
electric field goes away,

552
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:27,69
charges up, bang.
Charges up, bang.

553
00:37:27,69 --> 00:37:33,422
So it cha- it starts the whole
system charged because of a

554
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:39,255
random positive or negative
charge that would be present on

555
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:43,981
one of the cans.
What I want to do now is I want

556
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:49,814
to increase the gap between the
two bowls, and I make it so

557
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:55,547
large that you will never
achieve a magnetic-

558
00:37:55,547 --> 00:37:59,502
an electric field there of
three million volts per meter.

559
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:03,811
But somewhere else on the unit,
it has lots of sharp edges and

560
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:06,637
sharp points,
somewhere else the electric

561
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:10,875
field will reach the breakdown
voltage and so the system will

562
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:14,407
go into dis- into discharge,
into corona discharge.

563
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:18,08
You will never see sparks but
it goes into discharge.

564
00:38:18,08 --> 00:38:22,106
And you can see that because
now, I will open the gap now.

565
00:38:22,106 --> 00:38:27,28
If you now look at the electric
field it will reach a maximum

566
00:38:27,28 --> 00:38:30,267
value and now it goes into
discharge, you see.

567
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:33,984
It begins to sort of sputter a
little bit back and forth,

568
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,104
so now there is no longer the
spark on the bowl,

569
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:39,958
so you don't see anything
between the bowls,

570
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,878
but it is somewhere else.
I don't know where,

571
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:46,197
where there is a continuous
stream now of charging,

572
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:49,184
leaving the system,
and so it's discharging to

573
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:51,64
corona discharge.
And so in this mode,

574
00:38:51,64 --> 00:38:54,693
you expect the water to be
spread all the time.

575
00:38:54,693 --> 00:39:00,239
And I will show that to you by
switching now to the water.

576
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,869
Maybe Marcos,
you can improve on the- on the,

577
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:06,839
on the lights.
I could turn this off,

578
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,397
maybe then you'll see it
better.

579
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:14,347
But you see that the water is
spread and I will now bring the

580
00:39:14,347 --> 00:39:19,462
two bowls closer together -- ah,
you also want to see of course

581
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:22,844
the electric fields,
to see the discharge.

582
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:28,949
I bring them closer together,
stopping the corona discharge.

583
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,282
There's a spark.
And now watch the water.

584
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:36,948
See, the water is now just  not
interesting, and there it

585
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:39,614
spreads.
I'll turn the light off.

586
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:43,446
You look at the water.
And slowly the system is

587
00:39:43,446 --> 00:39:45,946
charging up.
You see the water?

588
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:48,945
Bingo.
You can even tell by the water

589
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:51,361
when it sparks.
There it goes.

590
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:54,361
Now I want to do something real
mean.

591
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:59,11
What I want to do now is to
raise

592
00:39:59,11 --> 00:40:05,002
the spout so high that A can
not reach out all the way to the

593
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,359
spout.
It's too far away,

594
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,055
and can not polarize the water.
So the poor battery can not

595
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:16,493
start.
That's a pretty mean thing to

596
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:20,224
do to a battery.
But on the other hand,

597
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:24,546
I'm not all bad.
What I can do is I can start

598
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:29,161
the system, I can help the
system.

599
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:33,652
I use my extrophorus disk and
I'm going to hold my extrophorus

600
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:37,7
disk very close to one spout,
temporarily allowing it to

601
00:40:37,7 --> 00:40:42,264
polarize the water and once it
starts, chances are that it will

602
00:40:42,264 --> 00:40:45,061
feed on itself and go into the
runaway.

603
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:48,963
It's not very predictable,
but I will make an attempt.

604
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:53,527
So the first thing that I will
have to do is maybe you can zero

605
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:55,588
the E field.
Yeah, thank you.

606
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:59,195
So the first thing I want to do
is

607
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:03,037
to make sure that if we start
running water now,

608
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:07,943
that the system doesn't start
by itself, because then I can't

609
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:12,031
make -- then I can't be nice to
the system anymore.

610
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:16,774
So let's just run some water.
I hope that Marcos brought it

611
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:21,271
high enough, and let's see --
and you can really tell by

612
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:25,277
looking at the  Oh,
there's the air bubbles in the

613
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:28,139
system.
I have to get rid of the air

614
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:31,521
bubbles.
There we go.

615
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:34
OK.
So look at the electric field

616
00:41:34 --> 00:41:36,866
doing nothing.
The system can't start.

617
00:41:36,866 --> 00:41:40,584
A is desperately reaching out
through this water,

618
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:44,457
but it's too far away.
It can't polarize it and the

619
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:48,64
battery can't get going.
Ah, ay, ay, it does get going.

620
00:41:48,64 --> 00:41:51,816
Oh, Marcos, we didn't bring it
far enough!

621
00:41:51,816 --> 00:41:55,146
You have to bring it higher!
Oh, by the way,

622
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:59,019
this is interesting.
Let's see where it actually --

623
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:04,837
oh, boy, this is incredible.
This is a distance of about

624
00:42:04,837 --> 00:42:07,593
fifty centimeters,
and look at it!

625
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:10,432
That is amazing!
The little sucker,

626
00:42:10,432 --> 00:42:14,941
I had never expected that.
Let's give it a fair chance.

627
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:18,615
Let's give it a chance.
It's only reasonable.

628
00:42:18,615 --> 00:42:22,54
Goes very slowly now.
You can see why it goes so

629
00:42:22,54 --> 00:42:26,381
slowly, because A very far away
from the spout.

630
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:29,638
But boy, and- and you can see
the water.

631
00:42:29,638 --> 00:42:32,31
The water is still pretty
normal.

632
00:42:32,31 --> 00:42:36,667
Oh, man, it's almost
cheating on me!

633
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:40,139
Uh-oh, uh-oh,
we'll have to raise it a little

634
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:44,399
further, er, aft- but I- I want
to give it a chance to,

635
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:47,713
uh, to spark.
Yeah, the two balls are close

636
00:42:47,713 --> 00:42:50,553
enough, so I will probably get
there.

637
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:53,236
Boy, this is almost torture for
me.

638
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:55,603
Aw, look at that,
look at that.

639
00:42:55,603 --> 00:42:58,128
I begin to see the water
already.

640
00:42:58,128 --> 00:43:01,757
Look at the water,
it's already spreading it --

641
00:43:01,757 --> 00:43:05,15
ah, there it is.
Marcos, can you run it even

642
00:43:05,15 --> 00:43:11,605
higher
and then we'll see whether we

643
00:43:11,605 --> 00:43:21,019
can actually stop it altogether,
bring it a lot higher and then

644
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:30,737
we will make an attempt to start
it with some help from a friend.

645
00:43:30,737 --> 00:43:36,507
You ready?
Oh, man, I can hardly -- OK.

646
00:43:36,507 --> 00:43:44,099
Don't tell me that it going
to- it

647
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:49,237
can go to the other direction,
of course, because it's a

648
00:43:49,237 --> 00:43:52,787
random choice that it has at the
start.

649
00:43:52,787 --> 00:43:58,205
Ah, ah, it's letting me down!
Let me see whether I can help

650
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:02,128
it a little.
My electr- electrophorus disk.

651
00:44:02,128 --> 00:44:07,266
I'm going to hold it here.
You know why I held it there?

652
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:12,03
Because I was hoping it would
reverse the direction.

653
00:44:12,03 --> 00:44:16,233
It doesn't even want to do
that.

654
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:20,253
It's really recalcitrant today,
isn't it?

655
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:23,168
Hold it here,
negative charge.

656
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:28,695
The reason why you see the
sudden change in the electric

657
00:44:28,695 --> 00:44:34,122
field is because of the e-field
probe, which senses the

658
00:44:34,122 --> 00:44:39,75
electrophorus disk when I held
it near the spout above B.

659
00:44:39,75 --> 00:44:43,569
It has decided,
no matter what -- well,

660
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:47,915
has it really?
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

661
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:51,288
Has it really made any
decision?

662
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,553
Ah!
It's thinking now what it's

663
00:44:54,553 --> 00:44:56,73
going to do.
Oh, man.

664
00:44:56,73 --> 00:45:02,715
Yeah, it's going in the
direction that I wanted it to go

665
00:45:02,715 --> 00:45:09,462
because I held negative charge
close to B and I know that would

666
00:45:09,462 --> 00:45:14,576
force it into the direction that
it's going now.

667
00:45:14,576 --> 00:45:17,623
Oh, man.
Yeah.

668
00:45:17,623 --> 00:45:21,021
Well, look, the distance is --
now, what is it,

669
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:24,788
now, something like eighty,
eighty-five centimeters?

670
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,669
The system is desperate,
but it's, it's,

671
00:45:27,669 --> 00:45:30,254
it's doing what it's supposed
to do.

672
00:45:30,254 --> 00:45:34,02
Physics works again.
And we will get a spark because

673
00:45:34,02 --> 00:45:38,009
-- is this close enough?
Ah, boy you got a lot for your

674
00:45:38,009 --> 00:45:40,299
money this time.
You really did,

675
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:43,327
didn't you?
You saw for one thing that the

676
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:47,242
system first started up going in
one

677
00:45:47,242 --> 00:45:50,788
direction and later in the
other because there was a random

678
00:45:50,788 --> 00:45:54,456
charge which changed polarity,
which is something that we can

679
00:45:54,456 --> 00:45:57,452
not always control,
but by holding this negatively

680
00:45:57,452 --> 00:46:00,631
charged disk close to the spout
above B, I forced the

681
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:04,055
polarization in the way that I
wanted it, and that's what

682
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:06,806
you're seeing now.
We've got to give it a fair

683
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,352
chance, and then I'll give you
light and then you have four

684
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:13,042
more minutes left to fill out
the evaluation.

685
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:16,099
But let's at least  give this
battery a charge now,

686
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:21,329
to lay its egg.
The water, it still doesn't

687
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:25,466
show much of a sign of
spreading, but I expect that

688
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:30,1
that will happen very shortly
because we've seen this now

689
00:46:30,1 --> 00:46:32,831
before.
It's slowly increasing the

690
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,065
charge on the cans,
A and B.

691
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:40,03
It's creeping so slowly that if
we wait you may never able to

692
00:46:40,03 --> 00:46:45,243
fill out your -- I'll give you a
little light so that you can s-

693
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:51,119
fill out the evaluation and then
we can still [inaudible]

694
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,437
and see what happens.
So please leave the evaluations

695
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:59,423
here as you leave,
and I will keep that going for

696
00:46:59,423 --> 00:47:03,492
some of you who have the
patience to see what will

697
00:47:03,492 --> 47:08
happen.
