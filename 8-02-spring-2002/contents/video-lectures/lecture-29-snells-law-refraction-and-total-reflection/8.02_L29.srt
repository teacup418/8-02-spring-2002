00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,584



2
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:04,354
Today, I'm going to talk about
light.

3
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:10,324
Light is an electromagnetic
phenomenon, and already in the

4
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:14,199
sixteenth century,
way before Maxwell,

5
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:20,273
a lot of studies were done of
the interaction of light with

6
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:25,3
water and with glass.
And the kind of experiments

7
00:00:25,3 --> 00:00:31,06
that were done follows -- say
this is air -- I call that

8
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:36,567
medium one --
and this is water -- call that

9
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:42,411
medium two -- and I have a light
beam that strikes this surface.

10
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:48,071
Light comes in like so -- and I
define this angle as the angle

11
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:51,689
of incidence,
and I call that theta one.

12
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:56,698
This is the normal to the
surface, and we call that the

13
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,966
angle of incidence.
I will see now that some of

14
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:05,234
that light is reflected --
reflected with an L,

15
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:10,64
as in lion --
and some of that light goes

16
00:01:10,64 --> 00:01:15,368
into the water,
and we call that refracted --

17
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:20,311
refracted, with an R,
as in Richard -- and this

18
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:25,684
angle, we'll call theta two.
And it was a Dutchman,

19
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:30,305
Willebrord Snellius,
who, in the seventeenth

20
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:36,538
century, found three rules that
govern the relation between

21
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:42,206
these three light beams.
The first one is that this

22
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:45,459
beam, this beam,
and this beam are in one plane.

23
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:48,643
As you see, that is my plane of
the blackboard.

24
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,896
The second thing that he found,
that this angle,

25
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,665
theta three,
which is called the angle of

26
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:58,056
reflection, is the same as the
angle of incidence.

27
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:00,548
That was known before him,
of course.

28
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:04,078
And then the third one,
which is the most surprising

29
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,3
one, which is called after him,
which is called Snell's Law --

30
00:02:08,3 --> 00:02:13,907
although his name was Snellius
-- is that the sine of theta one

31
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:19,891
divided by the sine of theta
two, if we go from air to water,

32
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:23,881
then that ratio is about one
point three.

33
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:28,768
If you go from air to glass,
it's a little higher,

34
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:34,952
it's like one point five or so.
He introduced the idea of index

35
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:38,343
of refraction,
which I will call N,

36
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:41,734
as in Nancy -- index of
refraction.

37
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:46,622
For vacuum, the index of
refraction,

38
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:51,245
per definition,
is one, but it's very closely

39
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:55,869
the same in air,
we always treat it as one in

40
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:57,655
air.
And in water,

41
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:03,54
the index of refraction is
approximately one point three,

42
00:03:03,54 --> 00:03:07,743
and in glass,
depending upon what kind of

43
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:12,051
glass you have,
it's about one point five.

44
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:16,78
And so we can now amend this
law, Snell's Law,

45
00:03:16,78 --> 00:03:21,735
by writing here
N two divided by N one,

46
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:26,125
and one being the index of
refraction of the medium where

47
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:30,827
you are, your incident beam --
that's why I put a one here --

48
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:35,217
and two being the index of
refraction of the medium where

49
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:38,822
you're traveling to.
You're refracted into this

50
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:40,546
medium.
And so you see,

51
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:45,171
indeed, that since water is one
point three, and air is one,

52
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:49,012
that this ratio for air to
water is

53
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:53,006
one point three.
And this is called Snell's Law.

54
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:57,68
And it is immediately obvious
that if you go from air to

55
00:03:57,68 --> 00:04:02,609
water, or you go from air to
glass, that angle theta two is

56
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,623
always smaller than the angle
theta one, because this number

57
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:11,533
is larger than one.
But if you go from water to

58
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:16,462
air, then the situation is
reversed, and that's what I want

59
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:19,521
to address now,
that's actually quite

60
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:22,921
interesting.
So now, my medium one is now

61
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:28,206
water,
and my medium two is now air.

62
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:34,638
And so now, I go from here to
here, and so here I have my

63
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:40,955
angle of incidence theta one
and here I have my angle of

64
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:46,583
reflection, that is the theta
three, and now here,

65
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:52,211
I have my angle theta two.
And so if I write down,

66
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:57,954
now, Snell's Law,
then I get the

67
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:03,68
sine of theta one divided by
the sine of theta two is now N

68
00:05:03,68 --> 00:05:07,432
two divided by N one,
but N two is one,

69
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:13,158
divided by one point three,
if we go from air -- from water

70
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:16,811
to air.
And what is so special here is

71
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:22,242
that theta two can obviously
never be larger than ninety

72
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:25,697
degrees.
And so if you substitute in

73
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:29,482
here,
theta two is ninety degrees,

74
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:33,355
then you will find that theta
one, then, is about fifty

75
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,151
degrees.
And if you apply this equation,

76
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:40,382
and you substitute for theta
one, an angle larger than fifty

77
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:44,398
degrees, you're going to find
the sine of theta two being

78
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:46,836
larger than one,
which is nonsense.

79
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:50,135
It cannot happen.
And so nature ignores Snell's

80
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:53,577
Law, and nature says,
"Sorry, I can't do it," and

81
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:57,091
what nature now does,
if the angle of theta one is

82
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,744
too
large -- in this case,

83
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:06,309
with water, larger than fifty
degrees -- this is not there

84
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:11,874
anymore, and all the light is
now being reflected off that

85
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:14,803
surface.
And we call that total

86
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:17,537
reflection.
Total reflection.

87
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:23,2
So total reflection happens
when theta one is larger than a

88
00:06:23,2 --> 00:06:28,277
certain critical angle,
and the sine of that critical

89
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:32,997
angle --
for which I write CR -- is N

90
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:37,224
two divided by N one,
but there is a condition.

91
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:42,462
And the condition is that N one
must be larger than N two.

92
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:46,689
If that's not the case,
then there is not total

93
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,813
reflection.
And total reflection is

94
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:54,959
actually very interesting,
it has practical applications,

95
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,656
which I will discuss with you
shortly, but I first

96
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:04,682
want to do a demonstration in
which I want to show this to

97
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:05,812
you.
I have here,

98
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:09,625
water, and here is air,
and I have a laser beam which I

99
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,45
can shine in,
and I can change this angle

100
00:07:12,45 --> 00:07:16,829
theta one, and slowly increase
it, and you will see that when I

101
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:19,371
approach fifty degrees,
first of all,

102
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:22,761
you will see that theta two
increases, increases,

103
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:26,151
increases, and then,
when I approach the critical

104
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:30,812
angle and exceed it,
then we have hundred percent

105
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:34,023
reflection.
Let me first turn on the laser

106
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:38,879
so that there's a little bit of
light, and I'm going to show it

107
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,578
to you there for those of you
who are not sitting very close,

108
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:47,807
and that means I have to set
the light situation -- OK,

109
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:50,705
so there you see,
the light coming in,

110
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:55,326
just the way we had it on the
blackboard, this is the way it

111
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:58,929
comes in, in water,
this is the reflected part,

112
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:03,81
and this is the one that is
refracted into the air.

113
00:08:03,81 --> 00:08:07,548
So that is this one here.
And now I'm going to increase

114
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:11,562
that angle, when I touch the
table, the water will start to

115
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:14,815
wiggle a little,
and you will probably see that.

116
00:08:14,815 --> 0.

117
0. --> 00:08:16,614
So I'm going to in -- OK,

118
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:20,351
I decre- I'm going to increase
that angle, look how I'm

119
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:23,466
increasing it.
Look, that theta two is getting

120
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:26,719
larger, is going to approach the
ninety degrees,

121
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,626
I increase theta one,
I increase theta one,

122
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:35,061
look at theta
two, almost ninety degrees,

123
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:40,985
I'm very close to the critical
angle now, I'm almost at it

124
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:46,285
right now, and now all the light
is being reflected.

125
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:51,585
Hundred percent reflection.
A remarkable phenomenon.

126
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:55,222
And this has practical
applications.

127
00:08:55,222 --> 00:09:00,418
And we're going to show you
some of these practical

128
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,185
applications,
too.

129
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:08,908
The most important practical
application is fiber optics.

130
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:12,952
If I have a fiber,
and it is properly designed --

131
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:17,249
so this is a fiber --  and some
light comes in here,

132
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:21,377
and it hits here -- so this is,
say, some plastic,

133
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:26,684
or glass, and this is air -- if
this angle of incidence is large

134
00:09:26,684 --> 00:09:30,897
than the critical angle,
hundred percent reflected.

135
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:36,12
And so nothing comes out in the
air, hundred percent reflected.

136
00:09:36,12 --> 00:09:39,995
Here, again,
the critical

137
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,698
angle is exceeded,
and so hundred percent is

138
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:46,028
reflected, and you can go
through this whole thing for

139
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:48,416
miles on end.
You can put even knots in

140
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,747
there, as long as you never
exceed the critical angle,

141
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:55,077
that light will propagate,
and there will never be any

142
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,842
loss of light,
and that's why people are very

143
00:09:57,842 --> 00:10:01,235
much interested in this.
You can transport even images,

144
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,749
as I will show you,
through fiber optics.

145
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:05,571
I have here,
uh, fiber optics,

146
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,467
which has four thousand fibers
in it, fifty microns in diameter

147
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,301
each, and we have a laser beam
here, and

148
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:18,501
the laser light will come out
-- I will show you the laser

149
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:23,794
light shortly there -- and it
doesn't matter what I do with

150
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:28,995
the fibers, I can even go
hundred eighty degrees and shine

151
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,644
them there, as long as,
inside the fiber,

152
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:35,747
I always exceed the critical
angle.

153
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:39,761
Uh, oh, I don't want the
television any more,

154
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:44,597
so we can turn this off,
and let's here have the laser

155
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:48,209
light.
There it is.

156
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,234
Here you see the laser light.
OK, now look at this,

157
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:57,063
this bundle that I have here.
I turn it into an absurd snake,

158
00:10:57,063 --> 00:11:00,846
almost like an S.
All the light still comes out.

159
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:05,514
So it goes al the way through,
I'm going to turn it hundred

160
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:09,378
eighty degrees around,
turn it to the wall there.

161
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,034
There it is.
So there's an amazing

162
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:16,3
phenomenon that this light
doesn't get out in the air,

163
00:11:16,3 --> 00:11:19,745
it stays
inside the fiber,

164
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,217
and that's the idea behind
fiber optics.

165
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:27,312
I have another,
uh, application of fiber optics

166
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,161
right here which is very
similar.

167
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:33,9
You can send an image through
fiber optics.

168
00:11:33,9 --> 00:11:38,796
This is my fiber optics,
now, thousands of small fibers.

169
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:43,159
And I send a message in here,
this side, an image,

170
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,185
could be a person,
could be a text.

171
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:52,942
And here we have a TV camera.
And we can watch that image on

172
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:58,719
this side of the fiber appear as
that image, and this television

173
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,111
camera will be able to see that
image.

174
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:06,695
And let's see whether we can
show you that message.

175
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:12,288
OK, I have to do something here
again, I think you're going to

176
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:16,506
-- ah, there it is.
So you actually can see the

177
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:19,349
individual fibers,
you see them?

178
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:26,461
How -- how interesting.
Each one, these are individual

179
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:30,144
fibers.
And their diameter is probably

180
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:34,623
not much more than fifty or a
hundred microns.

181
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:38,506
Let's see what message there is
for you.

182
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:41,094
Oh man, oh man,
exam three.

183
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,175
You don't want to hear about
that, do you?

184
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:49,455
Well, that depends on what the
message says.

185
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:51,148
Problem -- no.
No.

186
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:53,537
Problem one.
Problem one.

187
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:57,807
The figure --
oh, oh, oh, oh,

188
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:01,202
below -- oh,
I must have -- that's the wrong

189
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:05,939
message, I couldn't possibly
meant to give you away the exam,

190
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:10,361
of course, so I apologize for
that, that I showed you the

191
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,914
wrong message.
But at least it demonstrated to

192
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:17,941
you that you can send an image
through fiber optics,

193
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:21,573
even secret messages.
Newton had an interesting

194
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:27,336
explanation for Snell's Law.
Newton was the man of planets.

195
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:32,116
He was the man of particles,
masses, accelerations,

196
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:35,94
F equals M A.
And so his explanation came

197
00:13:35,94 --> 00:13:38,712
with particles.
He says light,

198
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:43,014
light are particles.
So if this is the surface

199
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:46,169
between, let's say,
air and water,

200
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:50,28
Newton argued as follows.
If light comes in,

201
00:13:50,28 --> 00:13:53,052
it has a certain speed,
V one.

202
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:57,258
And therefore,
it has a horizontal component.

203
00:13:57,258 --> 00:14:02,421
And it has a certain vertical
component.

204
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:06,016
And he says that if this light
ends up in water,

205
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:09,995
at the moment that it reaches
the surface, it gets an

206
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:13,132
acceleration perpendicular to
the surface.

207
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,815
Why?
He didn't tell us.

208
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:17,493
But he said,
it gets an acceleration

209
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:20,859
perpendicular to the surface.
In other words,

210
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,996
this horizontal component does
not change.

211
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,974
That remains what it was.
But this component changes,

212
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:31,952
this becomes substantially
larger,

213
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:37,5
depending upon the index of
refraction, of course.

214
00:14:37,5 --> 00:14:42,935
And so the new velocity is now
in this direction.

215
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:48,596
And so you see that,
indeed, the angle theta one is

216
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:55,276
larger than the angle theta two.
But Snell's Law immediately

217
00:14:55,276 --> 00:15:00,598
follows from this.
The sine of theta one -- this

218
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:03,483
angle,
if theta one.

219
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,478
So this angle,
if theta one.

220
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:08,876
So that's this velocity divided
by this vector.

221
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:13,087
And the sine of theta two is
this velocity divided by this

222
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,672
vector.
But these two velocities are

223
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:18,406
the same.
So you immediately find that

224
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:22,839
this ratio is V two divided by V
one, a great victory for Mr.

225
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,498
Newton.
Except there was one problem,

226
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:29,34
maybe, that it means that V two
is larger than V one,

227
00:15:29,34 --> 00:15:33,403
and so Newton argued that the
speed of light in water is

228
00:15:33,403 --> 00:15:38,889
larger than the
speed of light -- light in air.

229
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:42,633
And in glass,
of course, it would be even

230
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,721
larger.
Now, there was a Dutchman,

231
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:50,025
and the name of Dutchman was
Christian Huygens.

232
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:53,956
H-U-Y-G-E-N-S.
And this gentleman suggested

233
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:59,29
that perhaps light are not
particles, that they are waves.

234
00:15:59,29 --> 00:16:04,811
And this guy came up with a
genius idea -- which we now know

235
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:10,376
as Huygens' Principle,
at least you call it Huygens'

236
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:14,164
Principle, but we don't call it
Huygens' Principle.

237
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:17,952
You see, this sound,
U Y, is pronounced in Dutch as

238
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:20,451
[ouwe].
None of you can say [ouwe]

239
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:23,254
unless you're Dutch.
To make it worse,

240
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:26,512
this sound you don't have
either in English.

241
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:30,299
That's a [kkkkhhhh].
None of you can say [kkkkhhhh]

242
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,087
unless you're Dutch.
Let alone that you can say the

243
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:37,95
combination, Huygens.
Anyone who comes forward to me

244
00:16:37,95 --> 00:16:42,425
after this
lecture and who knows how to

245
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:46,038
pronounce the word Huygens,
has to be Dutch.

246
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,896
I will be kind to you,
and call it,

247
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:53,098
today, Huygens' Principle.
So Huygens came with the

248
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:55,955
following idea.
Here is a source of

249
00:16:55,955 --> 00:17:00,409
electromagnetic waves.
And these electromagnetic waves

250
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:03,098
propagate out in a spherical
way.

251
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:06,628
Not unreasonable.
And so you even see here,

252
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:10,41
the wave crests.
And so he defined the surface

253
00:17:10,41 --> 00:17:17,437
at the leading part of the wave,
where all points are in phase,

254
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:22,713
he called that the wave front.
So this is the wave front.

255
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:27,799
And he now postulated that each
point of the wave front

256
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:33,357
individually oscillates at the
same frequency as the source,

257
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:38,82
and produces spherical waves.
We call them secondary waves,

258
00:17:38,82 --> 00:17:44,001
often also called wavelets.
And that the envelope of the

259
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:47,916
wave
fronts of the secondary waves

260
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,984
is now the new wave front.
So it works as follows.

261
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:56,966
Each point that you can choose,
you can choose as many as you

262
00:17:56,966 --> 00:18:01,615
want to, starts to oscillate at
the same frequency as the

263
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:05,683
source, and produces,
on its own, spherical waves,

264
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:09,336
there they go,
and the new wave front is then

265
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:11,993
here.
And this is called Huygens'

266
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:15,314
Principle.
Of course, he doesn't give any

267
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:19,957
explanation of
why these points do that.

268
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:24,349
He hypothesized that.
And this principle can explain

269
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:29,515
Snell's Law in a very easy way.
I want you to read up on that

270
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:32,96
in your book.
And you will see that it is

271
00:18:32,96 --> 00:18:37,437
very easy to explain Snell's Law
with this principle,

272
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:41,484
except that now,
you will conclude that the sine

273
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:46,995
of theta one divided by the sine
of theta two is V one divided by

274
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:49,879
V two,
and therefore,

275
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:54,692
Huygens predicted that the
speed of light is lower than the

276
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:58,924
speed of light in air,
whereas Newton predicted that

277
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:03,654
the speed of light in water
would be higher than the speed

278
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:06,973
of light in air.
So the question now was,

279
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,877
who was right?
Are lights particles,

280
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:13,943
or are they waves?
Well, the wave-particle idea of

281
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:18,009
light has been a very
long-standing

282
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:21,016
issue in physics,
and I will show you,

283
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:25,971
I think, next week -- or maybe
after the exam -- how Young in,

284
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:29,709
eighteen oh one,
conclusively demonstrated that

285
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:33,365
light are waves.
So it looked like Huygens was

286
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:36,696
going to be the winner.
On the other hand,

287
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:41,733
I showed you last lecture that
light can behave like particles.

288
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:45,47
Photons, bullets,
tomatoes, radiation pressure,

289
00:19:45,47 --> 00:19:49,939
that's particles.
Mass, the whole thing,

290
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,433
the whole ball of wax.
And so maybe Newton was right,

291
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,792
maybe they are particles.
Well, they're both right.

292
00:19:56,792 --> 00:20:00,757
There are times that you can
actually interpret what you see

293
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:04,789
best be assuming they're waves,
and that there are times that

294
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,149
it's much better to assume that
they are particles,

295
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:11,71
with mass, like in the case of
the radiation pressure.

296
00:20:11,71 --> 00:20:14,062
But of course,
the key question now,

297
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:17,287
is, who was right in terms of
the speed of light?

298
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:22,356
Is the light going faster
in water, then Newton was

299
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:26,31
right, or is the light going
slower in water,

300
00:20:26,31 --> 00:20:30,534
then Huygens was right.
Needless to say that the

301
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:34,937
Dutchman was right.
The speed of light in water is

302
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:38,173
lower than the speed of light in
air.

303
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:42,217
When we arrived,
the speed of light in vacuum,

304
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:47,519
we used Maxwell's equations.
And they allowed us to conclude

305
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,659
that the speed of light,
much to everyone's surprise,

306
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:59,111
depends on epsilon zero and mu
zero in a very simple way,

307
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:04,369
I will call it for now,
V, that was one over the square

308
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:07,192
root of epsilon zero,
mu zero.

309
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:11,476
And we call that C.
If you had used Maxwell's

310
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:16,928
equations as they are valid in
materials, in dielectrics,

311
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,159
and also in materials that have
magnetic properties,

312
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,063
than it would be exactly the
same derivation,

313
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:30,091
but you would have seen a kappa
here, the dielectric constant,

314
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:33,656
and you would have seen here
the magnetic permeability.

315
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:36,363
Kappa, if you're not in air,
but in glass,

316
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,74
and water, is always larger
than one.

317
00:21:38,74 --> 00:21:42,767
So you see in front of you that
the speed of light in water is

318
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,144
lower than the speed of light in
air.

319
00:21:45,144 --> 00:21:48,973
This can also be written as C
divided by the square root of

320
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:53,265
kappa divided by kappa M,
and we would nowadays,

321
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:55,827
simply write that as C divided
by N.

322
00:21:55,827 --> 00:22:00,074
So the index of refraction is
really the square root of the

323
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:03,735
product of the dielectric
constant and the magnetic

324
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:06,81
permeability.
Now, kappa and kappa of M are

325
00:22:06,81 --> 00:22:09,299
very strong functions of
frequency.

326
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,692
And that's not so surprising,
because at very high frequency,

327
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:16,841
the intrinsic electric and
magnetic dipoles,

328
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:21,087
which are being aligned by the
alternative external fields,

329
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:26,446
cannot follow quickly enough.
A field wants to drive them in

330
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:29,167
this direction,
and it wants to drive them

331
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:32,353
back, and forward,
and back, and there's just not

332
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:35,87
enough time to do that.
And so you expect that at high

333
00:22:35,87 --> 00:22:39,454
frequencies, the values for
kappa are lower than at low

334
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:42,241
frequencies, which is exactly
what you see.

335
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:45,758
In the case of kappa M,
that's only important when you

336
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:48,811
deal with ferromagnetic
materials, because with

337
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:52,793
paramagnetic and diamagnetic
materials, kappa M is always one

338
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:54,651
anyhow.
Or very close to one.

339
00:22:54,651 --> 00:22:58,234
I have chosen water as an
example,

340
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:03,497
to show you the dependence of
kappa on the frequency.

341
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:08,558
This is on the Web,
so you can download it and make

342
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:13,314
yourself a copy.
And so if you look here -- this

343
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:18,172
is for water -- then,
you see there the -- at low

344
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:23,941
frequencies, at zero Hertz,
and even at radio frequencies,

345
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:30,115
at hundred megaHertz -- this is
hundred megaHertz,

346
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:33,098
this is, uh,
radio -- these are radio waves

347
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:37,006
-- notice that the dielectric
constant in water is about

348
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:40,061
eighty, and, um,
at, um, at visible light --

349
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:44,324
these are the frequencies of
visible light -- it's way lower.

350
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:47,947
We just discussed that.
The oscillations go to fast,

351
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:50,505
the electric dipoles can't
follow it.

352
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:54,199
And so the index of refraction
then, for radio waves,

353
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,828
at hundred megaHertz,
is roughly nine,

354
00:23:56,828 --> 00:24:01,019
and so the speed of those waves
in water is nine times lower

355
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,252
than
the speed of light in air -- we

356
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:08,772
call it speed of light,
but it's the speed,

357
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:13,382
of course, of the radio waves
then -- and in the case of

358
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:16,987
visible light,
you see that visible light in

359
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:21,681
water, the speed is only one
point three times lower than

360
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:24,866
what it would be in air,
or, of course,

361
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:28,051
in vacuum.
The frequency effect is very

362
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:31,487
noticeable.
If you take red light and blue

363
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:36,097
light, they have different
frequencies,

364
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:39,048
and therefore,
the index of refraction is

365
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:41,852
different for red light and blue
light.

366
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:46,204
If I take water -- the numbers
I'm going to give you are for

367
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:50,114
water -- then the index of
refraction for red light in

368
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:54,024
water is one point three three
one -- but the index of

369
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:58,229
refraction for blue light in
water is one point three four

370
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:00,737
three.
And we're going to use these

371
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:04,13
numbers, shortly,
to get a deeper understanding

372
00:25:04,13 --> 00:25:07,803
of the rainbow that's
behind this,

373
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:10,772
of course.
And so you notice that the blue

374
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:14,755
light is one percent slower in
water than the red light.

375
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:18,811
And this phenomenon that you
see there, that the speed of

376
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:22,504
electromagnetic radiation
depends on the wavelength,

377
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:26,053
depends on the frequency,
we call that dispersion.

378
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:29,964
It is a good thing that sound
in air is not dispersive,

379
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:34,092
because -- just imagine that
high frequencies would travel

380
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:37,018
faster than
low frequencies,

381
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,02
just as an example.
Or, or slower,

382
00:25:39,02 --> 00:25:40,84
for that matter.
It would mean,

383
00:25:40,84 --> 00:25:44,299
then, that if you go to a
concert, and you would listen to

384
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:47,514
the violins and the bass,
that the violins would reach

385
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:51,336
you first, and then the sound of
the bass would reach you later,

386
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:54,188
and the farther you are away
from the orchestra,

387
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:57,525
the worse that would be.
If the effect were very strong,

388
00:25:57,525 --> 00:26:01,286
here in twenty six one hundred,
someone sitting in the back row

389
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:04,381
could not even understand my
words, because the high

390
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:08,627
frequencies would reach that
person at a different

391
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:12,616
time than the low frequencies.
So sound in air is

392
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:15,774
non-dispersive.
But glass and water are

393
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,596
dispersive for light,
and it's very noticeable.

394
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:23,917
If I take a piece of glass,
and I give it this shape,

395
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:28,238
the shape of a prism,
and I shine some light on here,

396
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:32,476
light from these light bulbs,
or light from the sun,

397
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:36,133
for that matter,
then I can apply Snell's Law

398
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:40,371
here.
I know the angle of incidence,

399
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:43,167
theta one.
I know the index of refraction

400
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:46,593
-- this is for water,
but you can look them up for

401
00:26:46,593 --> 00:26:50,928
glass, of course -- and then you
will see there is a difference

402
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:55,264
of the index of refraction for
red light that there is for blue

403
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:57,571
light.
And so, when you reach this

404
00:26:57,571 --> 00:27:00,508
side of the prism,
again, you have to apply

405
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:04,633
Snell's Law, and when you do
that, you will see that the red

406
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:08,758
light doesn't come out at the
same angle that the blue light

407
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:12,884
come out, but the two diverge.
That is the

408
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:15,986
result of the fact that the
indices of refraction are

409
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:19,507
different, but also the result
of the fact that we have this

410
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,238
particular shape,
funny shape,

411
00:27:21,238 --> 00:27:24,639
namely that this side of the
glass is not parallel to this

412
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:26,489
side.
And so if you put a screen

413
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:29,472
here, you will see colors,
you can make a spectrum,

414
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:33,172
you can convince yourself that
the light from these light bulbs

415
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:36,156
is not just white light,
but that it contains many,

416
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,543
many colors.
Well, it has to contain many

417
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:41,467
colors, because if I look at
that gentleman there,

418
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:46,017
he's wearing a red shirt.
Where do you think that red

419
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:49,227
color is coming from?
It must come from the light

420
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:51,968
bulb, so there must be red light
in there.

421
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:55,579
The woman setting next to him
is wearing a green shirt,

422
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:59,257
so there must also be green
light in this -- this light.

423
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,464
And the same is true for
sunlight.

424
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:04,941
But the beauty is that,
making use of the dispersion,

425
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:08,418
you can decompose the white
light into the individual

426
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:11,761
colors, and make a spectrum.
If you take a piece of

427
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:14,637
plane-parallel glass,
which is window glass,

428
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:18,539
then you're
not going to see colors,

429
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,962
because, if now I shine light
on here, white light from the

430
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:26,85
light bulb, or from the sun,
it is true that it will

431
00:28:26,85 --> 00:28:31,12
obviously refract in here.
But when you apply Snell's Law

432
00:28:31,12 --> 00:28:35,771
again, here, then it will come
out -- all the colors will come

433
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:39,736
out in the same direction.
So the red light comes out

434
00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:44,006
here, and the blue light comes
out in the same direction.

435
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:46,445
And your brains are very
special.

436
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:51,825
If your brains see all colors
coming from one direction,

437
00:28:51,825 --> 00:28:55,723
they say, "I see white light.
Look at the light bulb.

438
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:58,871
You say, "Ah,
that's white light." But look

439
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,269
at this gentleman,
you say, "Hey,

440
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,492
it's red, it must come from
that light bulb.

441
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:08,914
So your brains are special in
the sense that they think that

442
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,837
the combination of many colors
is white.

443
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:16,409
And I can show that to you in a
-- in a rather convincing way.

444
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:20,231
You see here a disk.
And I would assume that you see

445
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:25,432
colors on that disk.
If not, you have a problem.

446
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:29,004
And I can fool your brains.
What I can do,

447
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:34,406
I can rotate that disk so fast
that your brains get so mixed up

448
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:39,546
that they're going to say to
you, "Yes, that's white light."

449
00:29:39,546 --> 00:29:44,251
So let me first give you some
ideal light on that disk,

450
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:47,388
and I'm going to spin it up a
little.

451
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,74
So you agree with me,
right?

452
00:29:49,74 --> 00:29:51,918
You still see colors,
yes?

453
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:55,404
Still see colors,
right?

454
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:57,069
OK.
You still see colors,

455
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:57,762
right?
Yes.

456
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,15
Haha, haha.
Hahahaha.

457
00:29:59,15 --> 00:30:01,439
This is white as it can be for
me.

458
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:03,174
Not too surprising,
right?

459
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:06,504
The same situation when I look
at the light bulb.

460
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:10,736
All these colors are processed
by my brains in such a way that

461
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:14,482
they think, or they -- well,
they actually make you see

462
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:17,257
white light.
It's as real as you can have

463
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:19,547
it.
And so this raises the subject

464
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:23,501
of the illusion of colors,
which is what I want to discuss

465
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:27,803
with you for the remaining part
of this

466
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:30,04
lecture.
If you ask a physicist,

467
00:30:30,04 --> 00:30:32,277
"When do you see certain
colors?

468
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:35,741
When to we see red?
When do we see blue or green?

469
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:38,7
Then chances are,
that he would give you a

470
00:30:38,7 --> 00:30:41,082
standard answer,
and he would say,

471
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:44,835
"Well, that depends on,
uh, on the wavelength in air.

472
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:49,238
If you tell me what wavelength
you're on, then I will tell you

473
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:53,712
what colors you will see." And I
have here a transparency which

474
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:58,042
makes the connection between
wavelength and

475
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:00,616
these colors.
It's also on the web,

476
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:04,931
so you can also download this.
And so if the wavelength of

477
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:09,472
light in air is about in this
range -- one angstrom is ten to

478
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:13,711
the minus ten meters -- yes,
you will probably say that's

479
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:16,284
red light.
When the wavelengths get

480
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:19,085
shorter, in this range,
you would say,

481
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:23,551
"Yes, that's green light." And
when the wavelengths get even

482
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:27,487
shorter, you would say,
"Yes, that's blue light." And

483
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:32,107
you can't see any
wavelength shorter than this,

484
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,788
you're getting to the
ultraviolet here,

485
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:38,246
and you can't see any
wavelength longer than this,

486
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:41,492
that's infrared,
and our eyes are not sensitive

487
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:45,161
for those wavelengths.
So this is all nice and dandy,

488
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:49,465
but we still have the problem
of the -- the effect that if you

489
00:31:49,465 --> 00:31:53,064
mix all the colors together,
like the rotating disk,

490
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:57,369
and like looking at the light
bulb, that our brains still tell

491
00:31:57,369 --> 00:31:59,697
us that we are seeing white
light.

492
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:03,366
So maybe matters are not really
as

493
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:08,204
simple as we think.
And this scheme about colors

494
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:13,762
has been worked out in quite
some detail already in the

495
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:17,982
seventeenth and in the
eighteenth century,

496
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:23,334
when it was discovered that
there was such a thing as

497
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:27,76
primary colors.
Maxwell did some research on

498
00:32:27,76 --> 00:32:32,804
that, and Helmholtz,
even the poet Goethe did work

499
00:32:32,804 --> 00:32:34,789
on
this.

500
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,76
They discovered that there are
primary colors,

501
00:32:38,76 --> 00:32:44,055
and when you mix light -- we
call this additive mixing -- the

502
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:48,202
three primary colors are green,
violet, and red,

503
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:52,703
and when you mix paint,
the three primary colors are

504
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,556
yellow, blue,
and red.

505
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:59,763
And the idea behind this is
that if you mix the -- the three

506
00:32:59,763 --> 00:33:04,705
primary colors in the right
proportion, then you can make

507
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:09,29
many colors.
I want to show you a color

508
00:33:09,29 --> 00:33:14,087
triangle, which is the recipe,
tells you how you have to mix

509
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:17,096
these colors,
and in order to do that,

510
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:21,243
I'm going to make it dark,
but not all the way dark.

511
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:25,878
So here you see the color
triangle, and the color triangle

512
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,455
has in the three colors -- the
three corners,

513
00:33:29,455 --> 00:33:34,172
the colors red -- one primary
color -- and then here it has

514
00:33:34,172 --> 00:33:37,262
violet, and then up there it has
green.

515
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:43,973
And now, I'll tell you
how this recipe has to be used.

516
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:50,75
So I'm going to draw here a
color triangle  and we have red

517
00:33:50,75 --> 00:33:56,124
here and we have green there,
and we have here,

518
00:33:56,124 --> 00:34:00,33
violet.
And if you look at this color

519
00:34:00,33 --> 00:34:06,522
triangle, you see all the colors
that you can imagine.

520
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:11,893
Sort of.
You see yellow,

521
00:34:11,893 --> 00:34:16,238
and you see here purple,
and you see orange,

522
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:21,29
you even see white.
So how do we make these colors,

523
00:34:21,29 --> 00:34:24,523
now?
Well, suppose I want to make

524
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:28,261
this color here.
So that's this color,

525
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:31,494
say.
Then you draw three lines --

526
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:35,637
one, two, three -- from the
three corners,

527
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:42,507
and this is the amount of red
that you have to put in,

528
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:47,07
and this is the amount of green
that you have to put in in the

529
00:34:47,07 --> 00:34:50,436
light, and this is the amount of
violet light.

530
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,904
And if you do that,
in that ratio,

531
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:55,672
you would get the color which
is here.

532
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:58,813
If you want to make very nice
yellow -- oh,

533
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:03,301
let's see, let's make some very
nice yellow, which is all the

534
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:07,041
way here, at the edge -- you
don't need any violet,

535
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:12,052
you can do that exclusively
with green and with red,

536
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:15,746
so let's go to this point here,
which is yellow,

537
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,969
it would mean,
then, that I have to put in

538
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:22,427
this much red,
and I have to put in this much

539
00:35:22,427 --> 00:35:25,335
green.
And if I add more and more red,

540
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:29,186
I go along this line,
then I end up here and I get

541
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:32,094
orange.
So I could make orange here by

542
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:36,81
simply increasing the amount of
red -- oh, this should not be

543
00:35:36,81 --> 00:35:39,246
violet, right?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,

544
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:42,625
this is green.
Oh, you should have yelled at

545
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:46,585
me.
So this is green and so if I

546
00:35:46,585 --> 00:35:50,887
want to make orange here,
then I simply have to give it

547
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:55,029
more red and less green.
And if you go to an extreme,

548
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:59,013
and you want to make white
light, and you go bingo,

549
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:03,553
right there in the middle,
well, then, you have to give it

550
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:05,943
this much red,
this much green,

551
00:36:05,943 --> 00:36:09,767
and this much violet.
And that's the idea that we

552
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:13,83
just saw, you mix all the
colors, and we mix up your

553
00:36:13,83 --> 00:36:18,272
brains as well,
and your brains then say,

554
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:22,928
"Gee, ah, that is white light."
So the idea behind the three

555
00:36:22,928 --> 00:36:27,663
primary color theory is that our
eye cells, the cells that we

556
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:31,215
have in the retina,
respond differently to the

557
00:36:31,215 --> 00:36:34,845
three primary colors,
and that color sensation,

558
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:38,869
which is, of course what the
brains are telling you,

559
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:43,289
those are the messages that are
being sent to the brains,

560
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:49,128
and they are processed here,
that they are the result of the

561
00:36:49,128 --> 00:36:51,147
mixing of these three
responses.

562
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:53,362
And the theory is quite
successful.

563
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:57,139
I'm going to try to make for
you the color yellow by mixing

564
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:59,419
these three colors green and
violet.

565
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:02,805
And if I want to make yellow,
then we already argued,

566
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:05,085
all I need is green,
and I need red,

567
00:37:05,085 --> 00:37:08,732
I don't even need violet.
And I'm going to do that with a

568
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:12,575
-- with this nice little box
here -- I will raise the screen

569
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:16,548
because we don't need the screen
any more, and I don't think I

570
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:18,632
need the, uh,
the slide any more,

571
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:23,631
um, John.
And this box  this box has

572
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:28,433
three lights in there.
Red, green, violet.

573
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:32,181
And I can change the
intensities.

574
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:38,037
Yes, I can show you,
I can make the -- the red less

575
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:43,191
strong, and I can do the same
with the green,

576
00:37:43,191 --> 00:37:51,858
I can make it less strong.
And I can do the same with the

577
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:54,843
violet.
And so if I want to make,

578
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:57,175
for instance,
that yellow,

579
00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:01,185
then I can do that with green
and red alone,

580
00:38:01,185 --> 00:38:06,874
and I have to give it a lot of
green, and a little bit of red.

581
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:10,791
So a little bit of red,
and a lot of green.

582
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,988
Can you adjust it a little?
Hmm, I see yellow,

583
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:17,413
don't you?
Who sees yellow?

584
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:21,983
OK.
So we make it a little orange,

585
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:25,732
then we have to give it a
little bit more red -- yes,

586
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:29,77
I give it a little bit more red
-- oh, it becomes orange.

587
00:38:29,77 --> 00:38:33,519
See, so I'm marching,
now, here, give it a little bit

588
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,826
more red, and you make it
orange.

589
00:38:35,826 --> 00:38:39,576
And what I can even do,
I can give them all three the

590
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:42,748
maximum strength,
and I can turn it to white.

591
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:46,353
So we will fool the brains
again, all these colors,

592
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:50,031
like the rotating disk,
like the light from the sun,

593
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:52,554
like the light from the lights
here.

594
00:38:52,554 --> 00:38:56,159
I think I see white light.
Your

595
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,13
color TV is based on this
principle.

596
00:38:59,13 --> 00:39:02,949
You have three electron guns in
your color TV.

597
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:08,042
And there are three different
chemicals on the screen of your

598
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:11,521
television.
And these chemicals are in the

599
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:15,85
form of very small dots.
And if electrons hit one of

600
00:39:15,85 --> 00:39:21,027
these dots, they become violet,
and the other chemicals become

601
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:24,507
green, and the other chemicals
become red.

602
00:39:24,507 --> 00:39:28,751
And so the whole idea is,
now, that

603
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:33,014
each beam hits its own chemical
dot, that's the way they arrange

604
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:35,18
things.
And by mixing the various

605
00:39:35,18 --> 00:39:39,105
intensities, you can mix the
intensities with three primary

606
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:42,354
colors, and you can see all
colors on television.

607
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:45,331
It works very well.
Of course, if you haven't

608
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:48,986
adjusted your television
properly, you may have noticed

609
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:52,708
that sometimes faces are
reddish, or faces are greenish.

610
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:56,431
Well, that's a matter of just
adjusting those three guns

611
00:39:56,431 --> 00:40:00,178
appropriately,
and then you can be very

612
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:02,651
successful, and it's very
impressive.

613
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,881
This, uh, three-color scheme
works quite nicely.

614
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:09,179
So, in many cases,
the three primary color theory

615
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:12,615
is quite satisfactory.
But there are cases where it

616
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:15,639
fails bitterly.
And those are the ones that I

617
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:19,349
want to discuss for the
remaining ten minutes and forty

618
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:21,686
seconds.
Already, in the nineteenth

619
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:25,396
century, it was known that there
were problems with the

620
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:26,908
three-color theory.
Mr.

621
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:30,372
Benham,
in eighteen ninety five,

622
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:34,058
invented a top which is named
after him, it's called the

623
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,739
Benham top.
I have one in my office on my

624
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,219
table.
It is a top that has just black

625
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,699
lines on it, no colors.
You rotate it,

626
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,051
and you see colors.
And we copied that top for you,

627
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,531
and we have that here,
this is a copy,

628
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:50,815
it's a large copy,
the top is only this small that

629
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,691
I have.
This is a Benham top.

630
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:56,579
I hope you will agree with me
that this is black and white.

631
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,802
Any one of you see colors,
let me know now.

632
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:03,6
I will ask you to leave,
then.

633
00:41:03,6 --> 00:41:06,592
OK, so no one sees colors.
Good.

634
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:10,453
So now, I'm going to rotate
that for you,

635
00:41:10,453 --> 00:41:15,375
and you will be surprised,
what you're going to see.

636
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:20,49
So there is the Benham top,
and I'm going to rotate it

637
00:41:20,49 --> 00:41:24,929
somewhere in the ballpark of
about seven Hertz,

638
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:28,597
five to seven Hertz,
let's take a look.

639
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:32,264
Black and white.
Hey, [unintelligible],

640
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:35,376
what am I
seeing?

641
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:38,301
I'm seeing colors.
Not very bright,

642
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:42,26
but I am seeing colors.
I see some rusty brown,

643
00:41:42,26 --> 00:41:46,992
right there in the middle,
and then I see something of a

644
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:50,606
grayish-green,
maybe, and dark blue further

645
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:52,327
out.
Who sees colors?

646
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:55,339
Who doesn't?
Oh, you're color-blind,

647
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,888
then.
That happens.

648
00:41:56,888 --> 00:42:00,846
Well, you see colors,
just with black and white

649
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:03,943
rotating.
And, to make it even worse,

650
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:07,487
I can
reverse the disk.

651
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:11,991
I first have to stop it,
otherwise we burn out the motor

652
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:14,776
-- and I can reverse,
and remember,

653
00:42:14,776 --> 00:42:17,478
the rusty brown was in the
center.

654
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:21,819
And now we're going to rotate
it the other way around.

655
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:26,323
And look again what you see.
You're now seeing the rusty

656
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:30,254
brown near the edge.
You see the colors reversed.

657
00:42:30,254 --> 00:42:33,858
A lot of research,
uh, was done in this area.

658
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:37,871
But a complete
neurophysiological

659
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:40,81
explanation is still not
available yet,

660
00:42:40,81 --> 00:42:45,219
although there are several very
successful models that can

661
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:47,694
predict what our brains will
see.

662
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:52,258
And when your color cells are
stimulated with flicker light,

663
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:56,976
there are phase delays between
the incident -- incident light,

664
00:42:56,976 --> 00:43:00,534
and the response,
the messages that are sent to

665
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:03,705
your brains, which are currents
of course.

666
00:43:03,705 --> 00:43:09,043
And the phase delay is
different for different colors.

667
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:13,151
So what we're going here,
we're fooling the brains,

668
00:43:13,151 --> 00:43:18,162
we're sending flicker light to
the brains with different phase

669
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:23,092
delays, the phase delays in the
center are different from the

670
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:26,625
phase delays further out.
And so the brains,

671
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:30,651
then, process that in the usual
way, and they say,

672
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:34,594
"Well, I'm sorry,
but you're going to see colors.

673
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:39,36
And that's what you're seeing.
The most fabulous example of

674
00:43:39,36 --> 00:43:44,475
where the three-color
theory fails -- or at least,

675
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:48,943
is very incomplete -- is the
work done by Edwin Land in the

676
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:52,179
early fifties.
Edwin Land, very famous man,

677
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:55,261
he was the inventor of the
Polaroid film.

678
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:59,576
He pioneered color theories,
and became very famous for a

679
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:03,582
particular demonstration that I
will do for you here.

680
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:07,28
He gave me two slides,
I got them personally from

681
00:44:07,28 --> 00:44:10,362
Edwin Land.
And these two slides that I'm

682
00:44:10,362 --> 00:44:15,008
going to show you are black and
white slides.

683
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:19,185
That is non-negotiable.
I'm going to show them to you,

684
00:44:19,185 --> 00:44:22,337
they are as black and white as
this disk.

685
00:44:22,337 --> 00:44:26,434
He took one of those slides by
taking a photograph of

686
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:29,35
something, and what that
something is,

687
00:44:29,35 --> 00:44:31,872
you're going to see very
shortly.

688
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:36,442
And the other black and white
slide, he also took -- again,

689
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:41,328
black and white film -- but he
put a red filter in front of his

690
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:43,062
camera.
But believe me,

691
00:44:43,062 --> 00:44:49,469
it is a black and white slide.
So you're going to see black

692
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:53,311
and white slides.
And then I'm going to do

693
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:57,997
something special with those
slides, and therefore,

694
00:44:57,997 --> 00:45:03,058
I'd rather go there now,
and, um, explain things to you

695
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:07,556
as they come along.
And so I have to make it very

696
00:45:07,556 --> 00:45:12,242
dark -- oh, the screen has to
come down, of course,

697
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:17,584
we're going to need the screen,
because we're going to see

698
00:45:17,584 --> 0.
slides.

699
0. --> 00:45:20,396
So I'm going to in -- OK,

700
00:45:20,396 --> 0.
So two black and white slides.

701
0. --> 00:45:24,282
So I'm going to in -- OK,

702
00:45:24,282 --> 00:45:30,048
So the first black and white
slide is this one.

703
00:45:30,048 --> 00:45:37,695
I hope we will all agree that
this is a black and white slide.

704
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:44,84
And the second black and white
slide is of the same scene.

705
00:45:44,84 --> 00:45:52,989
This, by the way,
was taken through a red filter.

706
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:56,735
But it is black and white.
The next one was not taken

707
00:45:56,735 --> 00:46:00,049
through a red filter,
but, I hope we all agree,

708
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,579
is black and white.
If I put a red filter in front

709
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:07,902
of this black and white slide,
you see exactly what you would

710
00:46:07,902 --> 00:46:09,847
have predicted,
namely that,

711
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:13,521
yes, it's like looking through
a red piece of glass,

712
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,259
the whole world turns a little
reddish.

713
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:19,213
Very boring.
Although some kids like that.

714
00:46:19,213 --> 00:46:23,032
So this is what you're going to
see.

715
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:27,344
I can do the same with the
other one, this is the one that

716
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:30,673
Edwin Land photographed through
a red filter.

717
00:46:30,673 --> 00:46:35,289
If I put a red filter in front
of it, you're going to see what

718
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,937
you expect, reddish,
pinkish colors.

719
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:40,434
OK.
What do you think you're going

720
00:46:40,434 --> 00:46:44,898
to see if we project one black
and white slide on top of the

721
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:48,53
other black and white slide?
Well, let's face it.

722
00:46:48,53 --> 00:46:52,54
Let's be down-to-earth.
Black and white plus black and

723
00:46:52,54 --> 00:46:56,398
white will remain black and
white,

724
00:46:56,398 --> 00:47:00,839
and that's what you see now.
One is now on top of the other.

725
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:04,527
You may not notice that,
but I will take one away,

726
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:08,064
and add it again.
Black and white plus black and

727
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:12,279
white gives black and white.
Now, I'm going to ask you to

728
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:16,569
sit very firm in your chairs,
because you're going to fall

729
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:19,353
off your chairs if you're not
careful.

730
00:47:19,353 --> 00:47:23,643
I'm now going to put in front
of the slide that Edwin Land

731
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:27,482
took through a red filter,
I'm going to put that red

732
00:47:27,482 --> 00:47:33,652
filter in front of my projector,
only through that slide.

733
00:47:33,652 --> 00:47:36,859
The other one remains as it
was.

734
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:40,996
And there we go.
And now what do you see?

735
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:44,41
You see colors.
Is this a miracle?

736
00:47:44,41 --> 00:47:48,134
Well, maybe it is.
I see yellow here,

737
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:52,065
I see green here,
I see some dark blue.

738
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:55,581
Who also sees colors?
Just say yes.

739
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,685
[Chorus of yeses].
Who doesn't?

740
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:03
Good for you.
Isn't this amazing?

741
00:48:03 --> 00:48:06,808
Two black and white slides.
That's all you're seeing and

742
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:10,615
then you see this silly red
filter, which normally would

743
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:14,215
give you only a little bit of
pinkish, reddish light.

744
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:18,439
But when you put one on top of
the other, something bizarre is

745
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:22,177
happening in your brains.
Your brains are so incredibly

746
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:26,193
mixed up that they really think
you're seeing yellow there.

747
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:30,416
And they really make you think
that you're seeing green there.

748
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:35,302
A reasonable question now,
is to ask, if we took a picture

749
00:48:35,302 --> 00:48:38,173
of this, you take your camera
with color film,

750
00:48:38,173 --> 00:48:40,598
what will you see?
Will you see colors,

751
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:44,107
or will it be black and white?
Yes, you will see colors,

752
00:48:44,107 --> 00:48:47,489
but the colors will be
different from the way that you

753
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:51,381
and I perceive them right now.
So now you can ask yourself the

754
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:54,253
question, well,
"What are not the real colors?

755
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:57,826
The ones that you and I see,
or the ones that our picture

756
00:48:57,826 --> 00:49:00,825
will record?" Well,
I think that's a meaningless

757
00:49:00,825 --> 00:49:03,377
question.
There is no such thing as right

758
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:07,976
or wrong in these matters.
Our brains are very

759
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:13,229
complicated, and whatever they
show us, that's the real thing

760
00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:16,031
for us.
Reality is very relative.

761
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,934
And if you're color-blind,
which quite a few people in my

762
00:49:20,934 --> 00:49:25,662
audience must be -- just a
matter of statistics -- then

763
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,165
they have a different reality
altogether.

764
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:32,93
Reality is only in the mind of
the beholder,

765
00:49:32,93 --> 00:49:38,27
and it all depends on how your
brains are processing messages.

766
00:49:38,27 --> 00:49:43,089
The message
that I'm giving you for this

767
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:47,122
weekend is, have a good time,
but by all means,

768
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:52,206
start working on your exam
three, which certainly is not an

769
00:49:52,206 --> 49:57
illusion.
