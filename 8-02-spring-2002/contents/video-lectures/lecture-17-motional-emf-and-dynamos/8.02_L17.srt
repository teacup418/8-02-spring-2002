00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,276



2
00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:06,16
So last lecture was arguably
the most important of all my

3
00:00:06,16 --> 00:00:10,258
lectures.
We saw how a changing magnetic

4
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:15,932
field can produce a current,
an induced electric field,

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:20,555
an induced EMF.
And Faraday expressed that in

6
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:25,178
his famous  law,
his famous equation which we

7
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:32,424
see there on the blackboard.
You select a closed loop in

8
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:34,926
your circuit.
Any loop is OK.

9
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:39,037
You attach an open surface to
that closed loop.

10
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:43,773
Any open surface is OK.
And you then get an EMF in the

11
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:48,777
loop, and that's the time
derivative of the magnetic flux

12
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:53,156
through that surface.
And the minus sign indicates

13
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:58,517
that the induced current itself
produces a magnetic flux that

14
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,372
opposes the
flux change,

15
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:06,962
and that we refer to as Lenz's
Law.

16
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:12,633
Today, I will expand on this a
lot further.

17
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:19,519
So let's start with a
conducting loop and a magnetic

18
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,84
field.
This is a conducting loop.

19
00:01:23,84 --> 00:01:31,806
Let the dimensions be Y X and
let- I have a uniform magnetic

20
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:38,152
field.
Magnetic field B is like so.

21
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:43,942
And I choose as the
perpendicular vector to my

22
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:51,148
surface, this is the surface
that I attach to that closed

23
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:54,88
loop.
I choose it pointing up.

24
00:01:54,88 --> 00:02:02,472
And so the angle between DA and
B, [inaudible] B is uniform.

25
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:07,104
So the flux,
phi B, is defined as the

26
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:12,895
integral of B dot DA,
over

27
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:17,233
this open surface.
Flux is a scalar.

28
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:21,696
It's plus or it's minus or it's
zero.

29
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:28,142
Flux has no direction.
So the flux in this case would

30
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:35,084
be X Y, which is the area of
this loop since the magnetic

31
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:41,034
field is uniform.
That's a very easy integral and

32
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:45,84
then
I get the magnetic field B,

33
00:02:45,84 --> 00:02:49,988
and then I get the cosine of
the angle.

34
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:56,1
So now according to Faraday,
it is the time derivative of

35
00:02:56,1 --> 00:03:00,138
this quantity that determines
the EMF.

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,068
Now, you can do that in several
ways.

37
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:09,307
You can have dB dT,
changing the magnetic fields.

38
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:16,729
This is the area A of the loop.
You can change the area.

39
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:21,564
You can have da dt.
But you can also change theta.

40
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:27,19
You can have a d theta dt.
And I will look at those today.

41
00:03:27,19 --> 00:03:31,631
This number here,
the way I have chosen my da,

42
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:35,875
is a positive number.
If somehow this number

43
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:41,303
increases in positive value,
the induced current that is

44
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:47,323
going to run will try to create
a magnetic field to oppose the

45
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:51,653
change.
So in that case if the flux,

46
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:55,776
which is now positive,
is getting larger positive,

47
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,067
then the current that's going
to run will be in this

48
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:02,591
direction.
That's Lenz for you.

49
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:06,798
So it creates by itself,
this current will create a

50
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,491
magnetic field in this
direction.

51
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:14,035
And if the magnetic flux,
which is now positive the way

52
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,727
I've defined it,
were decreasing,

53
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:21,019
then the current would go the
other

54
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,356
way around.
Last time, I did several

55
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:27,599
demonstration whereby we changed
B.

56
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:31,7
We had dB dT's.
And there was one particular

57
00:04:31,7 --> 00:04:37,422
demonstration that blew your
mind and that you will tell your

58
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:42,477
grandchildren about and that you
will always remember,

59
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:45,624
I hope.
Today, I'm going to change

60
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:51,251
theta and I'm going to change
the area, which will also give

61
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:57,641
me then induced EMF's and
therefore induced currents

62
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:05,407
into a closed conducting loop.
So let me make another drawing

63
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:13,044
of the closed conducting loop.
This has lengths Y and widths

64
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:20,682
X, and I'm going to rotate this.
My idea is you can see this

65
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:27,154
three-dimensionally.
I'm going to rotate this about

66
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:31,231
this
axis with angular frequency

67
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,423
omega.
Omega is two pi divided by the

68
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:37,703
periods.
The period is the time of one

69
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:40,895
rotation.
Normally we choose for that

70
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:44,353
capital T.
I don't want to do that today

71
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:47,546
because T can confuse you with
Tesla.

72
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:52,954
And so I'm going to rotate this
around so the angle theta that

73
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:56,856
you have there,
theta then becomes theta zero

74
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,403
plus omega T,
going back

75
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:04,872
to eight oh one.
And I choose this theta zero

76
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:09,748
such that a T zero,
I choose my theta to be zero,

77
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:14,116
and so I have nothing to do
with theta zero.

78
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:17,367
So what now is the magnetic
flux?

79
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:21,836
This is my loop.
I have to commit myself to a

80
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:25,595
surface.
Well, I will just choose this

81
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:30,572
flat surface,
just like I did there.

82
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:36,504
I chose that flat surface.
I'm free to choose any surface,

83
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:42,331
why not taking the flat one.
And so the flux of that flat

84
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:46,805
surface is then the area which
is X times A,

85
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:50,863
X times Y, that's the area of
this loop.

86
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:54,401
And then I have the magnetic
field.

87
00:06:54,401 --> 00:07:00,644
And then I have cosine omega T.
Maxwell tells me it's not the

88
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:06,409
flux that matters.
It is the change in the flux

89
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,039
that matters.
OK, so d phi dt.

90
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,939
I got the A,
the area, I've got the magnetic

91
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,116
field.
An omega pops out,

92
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:19,651
and I get a sign of omega T and
I get a minus sign.

93
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:24,73
Normally I don't care about
minus signs, because I'm only

94
00:07:24,73 --> 00:07:28,902
interested in the magnitude of
the induced EMF.

95
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:33,437
I always know in which
direction the

96
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:35,75
current will flow,
I really do,

97
00:07:35,75 --> 00:07:39,913
because I know Lenz's law.
So you should never have too

98
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:44,385
many hang-ups on those minus
signs, but since I'm getting a

99
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:49,011
minus sign out of this now here,
it would be a little foolish

100
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:53,792
not to put a minus here and make
this into a plus because that,

101
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:58,495
then, according to Faraday is
immediately the EMF and that EMF

102
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:02,967
is changing with time because
you have this sign omega T in

103
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,357
here.
And so the current that is

104
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:09,5
going to
flow, the induced current,

105
00:08:09,5 --> 00:08:12,313
which will also be
time-dependent,

106
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:16,403
is the EMF divided by the
resistance in the loop,

107
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:20,324
and this is the total
resistance of that entire

108
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:23,477
network.
There could be light bulbs in

109
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:27,056
there, there could be
resistances in there.

110
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:30,721
It's the total resistance.
And this current,

111
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:34,982
when I rotate this loop,
is going to alternate in a

112
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:40,862
sinusoidal fashion.
And we call that alternating

113
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:45,311
current, AC.
That's what's coming out of the

114
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,243
wall, AC.
Suppose this loop was double,

115
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:53,589
and what I mean by double is
the following,

116
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:58,763
that it works like this.
Follow my picture closely.

117
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:02,074
I will go slowly.
It's like this,

118
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:07,144
like this, like this,
so back and I close it here,

119
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:12,215
so it's one closed loop,
but I have

120
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:15,39
two windings.
I have to attach a surface to

121
00:09:15,39 --> 00:09:17,96
this closed loop.
That's mandatory.

122
00:09:17,96 --> 00:09:22,118
Farado- Faraday insists I
attach an open surface to this

123
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:24,764
closed loop.
What will it look like?

124
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,317
Well, I advise you to take
that, dip it in soap,

125
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,492
and look at it,
and what you will see then,

126
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:35,877
because the soap will attach
everywhere to the closed loop,

127
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:38,221
you're going to see one
surface.

128
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:42,53
It's not two separate surface.
You don't have two separate

129
00:09:42,53 --> 00:09:46,385
loops.
It's one surface but sort

130
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:50,906
of two layers.
One is lower and the other one

131
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:55,323
comes on top.
And so, the magnetic flux will

132
00:09:55,323 --> 00:10:01,795
double now, because you're going
to see that this magnetic field

133
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:07,548
penetrates both this soap film
and the one that is below,

134
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:13,404
and so you get twice the EMF
and if you have N windings in

135
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,307
one closed loop,
capital N,

136
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:25,145
then the EMF that you get would
be N times larger and you can

137
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:31,545
make N one thousand.
There's no problem with that.

138
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:39,774
I'm going to do a demonstration
for you whereby I'm going to use

139
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:49,048
the earth's magnetic field and a
loop that you see here that has

140
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:55,56
forty-two windings.
So my capital N is forty-two.

141
00:10:55,56 --> 00:11:00,579
Not just two like here,
but forty-two.

142
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:05,327
And it is circular.
It has a radius.

143
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:10,346
I think it's about thirty
centimeters.

144
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:16,722
Here you have it.
It's about thirty centimeters.

145
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:21,234
So the area,
pi r squared,

146
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:26,803
which is my capital A,
pi R squared is about oh point

147
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:32,264
two eight square meters.
You may want to check that.

148
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:38,047
I use the Earth's magnetic
field, which is about half a

149
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:43,83
Gauss, so that's about five
times ten to the minus five

150
00:11:43,83 --> 00:11:49,828
Tesla, if we work in SI units.
And I'm going to rotate it

151
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:54,219
around with a period,
periods

152
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:58,567
of about one second.
That means omega,

153
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:05,502
two pi divided by the periods,
is then about six radians per

154
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:09,145
second.
I call that six for now.

155
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:16,197
And so what is the EMF that I'm
going to get when I rotate it

156
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:22,427
once around per second?
Well, the EMF will change as a

157
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:27,814
function of time.
We're going to get forty-two,

158
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,982
that's N.
We're going to get A,

159
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,451
that is oh point two eight.
We're going to get B,

160
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:37,86
that is five times ten to the
minus five, and then we're going

161
00:12:37,86 --> 00:12:39,667
to get omega,
that is six,

162
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,125
and then we get this sign of
six T.

163
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:46,244
You see the equation there.
The only difference is we have

164
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:50,581
a capital N out here because we
have N windings in the closed

165
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,038
loop.
And this number here in front

166
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:57,986
of the sign six T,
you should check that,

167
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,824
is about three and a half
millivolts.

168
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:08,114
Three point five times ten to
the minus three times the sign

169
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:11,739
of six T, and that now is in
volts.

170
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:16,963
So you get an alternating EMF,
positive, negative,

171
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:23,253
and the maximum value that you
would get is three and a half

172
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:30,322
millivolts.
If I look at the EMF  as a

173
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:37,956
function of time,
it would be something like

174
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:42,75
this.
And from here to here,

175
00:13:42,75 --> 00:13:52,869
would then be one second if I
really rotated around in one

176
00:13:52,869 --> 00:14:01,746
second.
And so the current,

177
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:05,158
the induced EMF,
according to Ohm's Law,

178
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:10,057
is always the induced current
times the resistance of the

179
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:14,693
whole loop, so the induced
current will also have this

180
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:18,892
shape, of course.
And how high that is depends on

181
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:22,392
how large R is.
The EMF is independent of

182
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:25,628
capital R.
The EMF follows exclusively

183
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:29,827
from those numbers.
It's the current that depends

184
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,354
on
what the resistance is.

185
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:36,368
Suppose now I rotate twice as
fast.

186
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:40,181
I double omega.
Two things are changing now.

187
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:43,994
For one thing,
that the full period now goes

188
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:47,54
from here to here,
only in half a second.

189
00:14:47,54 --> 00:14:50,998
But there's something else that
changes.

190
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:55,254
The EMF now doubles,
because look at my equation.

191
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,978
It's hiding behind the
blackboard, I think.

192
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:05,234
There is an omega in there.
It's linearly proportional to

193
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:08,689
omega, because it's d phi dt
that matters.

194
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:13,155
See, the omega pops out,
and so you now get double the

195
00:15:13,155 --> 00:15:18,127
EMF, so the three and a half
millivolts maximum would become

196
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:23,267
seven, and so if I try to make a
drawing of that twice as high

197
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:27,649
here, twice as low here,
then you would get something

198
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,957
like this, and so this omega is
now twice this one.

199
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:38,381
You get double the maximum
value of the EMF.

200
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:45,444
We're going to show that here.
I'm going to improve on my

201
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,984
lights.
You see there a current meter

202
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:55,281
with a sign sensitive,
can go to the right,

203
00:15:55,281 --> 00:16:01,209
can go to the left.
And I'm going to rotate this

204
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,245
loop.
When you rotate a loop in a

205
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:10,605
magnetic
field, you can even rotate it

206
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,691
in such a way that you get no
EMF.

207
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:18,365
I can show that to you easily.
If this is the loop,

208
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:23,134
and if somehow the magnetic
field came in like this,

209
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:27,528
if you rotated this loop now
around this access,

210
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:32,577
there would never be an EMF,
because the DA and B would

211
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:38,468
always be perpendicular to each
other, so there's never any flux

212
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:41,539
going
through this system.

213
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,417
No flux change.
But of course,

214
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:47,043
if you rotate it around this
direction, it would be fine.

215
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:50,021
So think about this.
Don't fall into that trap.

216
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:53,711
You can rotate in such a way
that there is no flux change.

217
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:57,596
We don't have that problem at
all because the magnetic fields

218
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,992
here on earth,
in Boston, doesn't come

219
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:03,359
straight from heaven down,
but it comes rather steep,

220
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,495
so there's never any problem
here.

221
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:07,567
I don't have to worry about
that.

222
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:11,743
So here is that loop,
forty-two windings.

223
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:14,465
The scale there is in
microamperes,

224
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:19,029
so if you want to you can
calculate what the resistance of

225
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:23,032
the loop is when I rotate,
but that's really not my

226
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:26,155
objective.
I want you to see that when I

227
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:29,838
rotate it, that you get an
alternating current.

228
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:33,12
Very modest,
because I rotate very slowly.

229
00:17:33,12 --> 00:17:36,723
Now I rotate faster,
and it is proportional to

230
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:42,969
omega, and so if I rotate faster
you get a much larger maximum

231
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:45,664
induced current.
A larger EMF,

232
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:50,126
a larger current.
I don't know how fast I can go.

233
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:53,194
This is about as fast as I can
go.

234
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:57,191
Gets almost up to four
microamperes maximum,

235
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:02,024
and so we are producing here
AC, alternating current.

236
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:07,23
We have slipping contacts here
so that the system doesn't

237
00:18:07,23 --> 00:18:12,25
break, and we could put a light
bulb here

238
00:18:12,25 --> 00:18:17,935
somewhere in this line and then
the light bulb may glow.

239
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:22,689
In United States,
what comes out of the wall is

240
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:27,031
sixty Hertz.
So that means that the current

241
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:33,129
through a light bulb becomes
zero a hundred twenty times per

242
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:36,54
second.
A hundred twenty times per

243
00:18:36,54 --> 00:18:42,432
second do you go [inaudible]
zero if you have sixty Hertz.

244
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:47,084
Does it mean that hundred
twenty

245
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,1
times per second there is no
light from the light bulb?

246
00:18:51,1 --> 00:18:55,265
No, it doesn't mean that
because filaments get hot and so

247
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:58,611
they still glow even when the
current is zero.

248
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:03,148
But they don't cool that fast.
If you take a fluorescent bulb,

249
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:05,602
then indeed,
fluorescent tube goes

250
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,024
completely off and on,
hundred twenty times per

251
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,891
second, and therefore you can
use them very nicely as

252
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:16,089
stroboscopes,
but of course the frequency is

253
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:20,18
fixed.
You can't change the frequency.

254
00:19:20,18 --> 00:19:23,153
It's a hundred and twenty
Hertz.

255
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:28,43
So now you're getting the idea
of an electric generator,

256
00:19:28,43 --> 00:19:31,404
or what we call,
if you want to,

257
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:35,913
a dynamo, which produces AC.
You have a turbine,

258
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:40,614
and a turbine rotates
conducting loops in magnetic

259
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:46,274
fields, and that according to
Faraday will then produce your

260
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:49,152
EMF.
And that runs our economy.

261
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:53,949
You have a permanent magnet and
you

262
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:58,558
rotate conducting loops,
windings, in that magnetic

263
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,97
field.
The higher your magnetic field,

264
00:20:01,97 --> 00:20:05,75
the higher the EMF.
The faster you rotate,

265
00:20:05,75 --> 00:20:09,991
the higher the EMF.
The more windings you have,

266
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:14,601
the higher the EMF.
And the larger the area of your

267
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:19,764
loops, the higher the EMF.
As you can see on the equation

268
00:20:19,764 --> 00:20:23,729
that I keep hiding,
but that's

269
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:27,241
where it is.
In the United States we have

270
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:31,807
sixty Hertz as I mentioned,
and we are committed to a

271
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:36,812
maximum voltage coming out,
that is the maximum value that

272
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:41,73
you get from your alternating
voltage, of hundred and ten

273
00:20:41,73 --> 00:20:46,91
times the square root of two
volts, and we call that hundred

274
00:20:46,91 --> 00:20:50,423
ten volts.
In Europe, we have fifty hertz

275
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:56,042
and the maximum voltage there in
the oscillation is

276
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:59,624
two hundred and twenty times
the square root of two.

277
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:03,628
You can not change omega and go
faster somewhere where you

278
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:07,491
generate this electricity,
because that would have major

279
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:10,511
consequences.
Number one, the EMF that comes

280
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:14,022
out of the wall would go up,
so you might blow your

281
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,042
television, your circuits.
But besides that,

282
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,765
you would change also the
frequency of the alternating

283
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:24,768
current, and there are many
systems that run in such a way

284
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:28,771
that they're locked into that
frequency,

285
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:31,775
for instance,
many electric clocks and

286
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:35,51
certainly record players if you
still have one.

287
00:21:35,51 --> 00:21:40,299
I locked into the sixty Hertz
and so if you were to increase

288
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,332
omega your record player would
go around faster and your clocks

289
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:47,93
would go faster.
A long time ago,

290
00:21:47,93 --> 00:21:52,801
when I came over from Europe,
I brought my record player with

291
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,48
me.
The record player requires two

292
00:21:55,48 --> 00:21:59,945
hundred and twenty volts,
so I bought a transformer here

293
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:03,162
to
that, the hundred and ten

294
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:05,84
volts at my home would become
two twenty.

295
00:22:05,84 --> 00:22:08,653
That was fine.
And so the record player was

296
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:10,059
happy.
It was running.

297
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:13,943
But it ran twenty percent too
fast because I had overlooked

298
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:17,761
that there are sixty Hertz here
and fifty Hertz in Europe.

299
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:21,578
It was going a little bit too
fast, and you know what that

300
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:25,529
means when it goes too fast --
[inaudible] so you can't even

301
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:28,074
here the music,
and that's exactly what

302
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:31,757
happened with my record player.
So if we look at a power

303
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:36,31
station, as we discussed earlier
in this

304
00:22:36,31 --> 00:22:40,925
course, and let us suppose to
get some- some numbers,

305
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:45,54
that the maximum EMF that the
power station produces,

306
00:22:45,54 --> 00:22:50,599
let's say, is three hundred
kilovolts which it puts on the

307
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,439
line.
And let's say we have a- we

308
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:58,231
have loops that have an area of
about one square meter,

309
00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:03,29
and that they use magnetic
fields which are let's say half

310
00:23:03,29 --> 00:23:06,573
a Tesla.
It's by no means unreasonable

311
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:12,144
numbers.
And if now you want sixty Hertz

312
00:23:12,144 --> 00:23:18,86
frequency, so your frequency F
sixty Hertz, so your omega is

313
00:23:18,86 --> 00:23:23,073
about six times higher,
two pi higher.

314
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:28,651
It's about three hundred sixty
radians per second.

315
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:34,115
If now you have about seventeen
hundred windings,

316
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:40,377
and you can check that at home,
there you get your three

317
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:45,386
hundred kilovolts.
Power is induced EMF times

318
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:51,989
current and with Ohm's Law you
can replace E

319
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:55,273
by IR, and so you get I square
R.

320
00:23:55,273 --> 00:24:01,021
This is joules per second,
and so someone has to do work.

321
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:06,256
Someone has to put in the
energy, for which you need

322
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:11,081
perhaps fossil fuel,
have to burn oil or coal to

323
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:15,392
keep the turbines going,
or nuclear energy,

324
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:17,753
or waterfalls,
or winds.

325
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:23,983
But something gotta keep those
windings going,

326
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:30,885
to keep our economy going.
A typical power station in this

327
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:37,909
country has about one thousand,
produces about one thousand

328
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,752
megawatts.
It is about one thousand times

329
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:49,655
a million joules per second.
I have here a generator which

330
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:54,74
is run by manpower,
and for this

331
00:24:54,74 --> 00:24:58,839
I need a strong man.
Who wants to volunteer?

332
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,413
You look very strong,
there.

333
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:04,844
Ah, you don't want to look at
me now.

334
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:08,467
Come on.
Every morning we talk a little

335
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:13,9
bit, but now you didn't see me.
This is a power generator,

336
00:25:13,9 --> 00:25:17,617
magnetic field.
You see the magnet here.

337
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:22,955
And there are current loops,
windings, and when you crank

338
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:27,189
this
you turn those windings into

339
00:25:27,189 --> 00:25:31,342
these magnetic fields.
There's a light bulb here,

340
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:35,062
twenty watts,
and this gentleman is go- what

341
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:37,571
is your name?
Student: Naveen.

342
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:40,513
Naveen.
That's almost my last name.

343
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:45,618
Can you start turning and see
whether you can produce twenty

344
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:48,646
watts?
Put your foot on the -- yeah,

345
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:52,28
yeah, keep going.
Ah, man, a little better!

346
00:25:52,28 --> 00:25:55,654
Keep going!
That's not twenty watts yet!

347
00:25:55,654 --> 00:26:00,413
Are you sure you had a good
breakfast

348
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:05,841
this morning?
He's producing twenty- roughly

349
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:12,405
twenty joules per second now.
Will you stop a minute?

350
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:18,591
We have six light bulbs here.
Naveen, be my guest.

351
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:24,146
Hundred twenty watts.
Man, where is Superman?

352
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:29,069
I see nothing!
Hundred-twenty joules per

353
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:34,553
second,
he doesn't even come close!

354
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:37,765
Keep going, man,
keep going.

355
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:44,07
You want me to stop the whole
[inaudible], keep going.

356
00:26:44,07 --> 00:26:46,449
Forget it!
Forget it.

357
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:50,969
You tried, and that's all that
matters.

358
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:57,631
But you see how difficult it
is to produce hundred twenty

359
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:03,841
joules per second.
Now, think about it,

360
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:07,98
when you run your hundred watt
light bulb at home,

361
00:27:07,98 --> 00:27:12,71
and you do that for ten hours,
that is one kilowatt hour.

362
00:27:12,71 --> 00:27:17,61
That costs you only ten cents.
Would you run that ten hours

363
00:27:17,61 --> 00:27:20,566
for ten cents?
You can't even do it,

364
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:22,931
man!
I'll show you something.

365
00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:27,999
I do a lot of mountaineering,
and in the mountains you want a

366
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:32,223
light that always works.
When you need it the most,

367
00:27:32,223 --> 00:27:36,108
the batteries are flat,
so you

368
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:41,635
always have with you a dynamo.
This is my dynamo,

369
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:44,629
hand-powered.
You see that?

370
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:50,847
That is Superman for you!
This is a hundred-twenty watt

371
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:55,683
light bulb!
And I can keep it going all the

372
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:59,022
time.
I can do better for you.

373
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:04,434
I have a radio here.
And this radio has a little

374
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:08,924
generator.
Magnetic field,

375
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:14,381
constant magnets,
permanent magnet,

376
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:23,689
and windings which you turn
around, and when I do that I do

377
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:31,231
work, and I generate an EMF.
I charge batteries.

378
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:39,577
And then I can play this radio.
[radio voice]

379
00:28:39,577 --> 00:28:45,061
I don't know about that.
And it's designed in such a way

380
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:50,545
that if you turn just for a
minute that you have several

381
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:53,836
hours that you can play the
radio.

382
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:58,722
It's quite amazing.
Now, we're going to change the

383
00:28:58,722 --> 00:29:01,913
area.
So far we've changed theta.

384
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:05,303
Now we're going to change the
area.

385
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:10,014
I have again a conducting
loop here.

386
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:14,347
But now I have a crossbar here
which I can move.

387
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:18,865
I can move it with a velocity V
in this direction,

388
00:29:18,865 --> 00:29:23,843
or I can move it to the left.
Let this be L and let the

389
00:29:23,843 --> 00:29:27,623
lengths be X.
My surface that I'm going to

390
00:29:27,623 --> 00:29:32,232
choose, I always have to commit
to an open surface,

391
00:29:32,232 --> 00:29:36,657
is a flat surface.
And I'll make life very simple

392
00:29:36,657 --> 00:29:40,714
for all of us,
let's assume that the magnetic

393
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:44,282
field
going straight up.

394
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,273
Let my DA, it's perpendicular
to the surface,

395
00:29:48,273 --> 00:29:51,719
B straight up,
B and DA are in the same

396
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:54,893
direction now.
Makes my life simple.

397
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:59,7
And so what is the flux now,
going through my surface?

398
00:29:59,7 --> 00:30:02,874
Well, that's the area,
which is L X,

399
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:07,862
times the magnetic field,
which I will assume is uniform

400
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:12,579
throughout this surface.
So as simple as you can have

401
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:15,571
it.
Faraday says,

402
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:21,741
"I don't care what the magnetic
flux is!" I want to know how

403
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:26,447
that magnetic flux is changing.
All right, OK,

404
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:31,257
Mister Faraday.
D phi dt equals L times B times

405
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:34,498
dx dt.
But dx dt is my velocity,

406
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:37,949
and so I get here times the
speed.

407
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:43,282
Dx dt is the velocity.
And this now is the magnitude

408
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:48,055
of the EMF.
Notice I don't care about minus

409
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,609
signs.
I just want to know how large

410
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:52,945
the EMF is in terms of
magnitude.

411
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:57,106
I always know the direction,
because I know if I move this

412
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:01,487
to the right that the flux is
positive, the way I have chosen

413
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:05,794
my DA, and as I move it to the
right this flux is increasing

414
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:09,882
and so I know that the current
is going to run like this,

415
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:15,284
which then creates a magnetic
field that opposes the change.

416
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:20,827
And if I go in the other
direction with the velocity,

417
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:24,985
then of course the current will
reverse.

418
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:28,29
Phi L X B, I can live with
that.

419
00:31:28,29 --> 00:31:33,194
D phi dt, I can put a B here,
if you like that,

420
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:38,844
to remind you that we're
dealing with magnetic fluxes,

421
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:40,55
L B V.
I'm happy.

422
00:31:40,55 --> 00:31:46,094
If I look here at this rod,
try to make you see three

423
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:54,267
dimensionally this rod is coming
straight out of the blackboard.

424
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:58,041
Then the current is now coming
to you.

425
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:03,958
The magnetic field is pointing
straight up, and so remember

426
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:09,467
that the Lawrence force is
always in the direction of I

427
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:15,588
cross B, is in this direction.
That means the Lawrence force,

428
00:32:15,588 --> 00:32:20,077
F L, which in this case would
be the current,

429
00:32:20,077 --> 00:32:26,198
times the length of this bar
which is the length

430
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:30,147
of this bar times B.
That is the force that I have

431
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:34,821
to apply if I put it to the
right, because that force is to

432
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:39,254
the left, so the force of
[inaudible] is the same but in

433
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:42,8
this direction.
I have to overcome the force,

434
00:32:42,8 --> 00:32:45,782
the Lawrence force,
in this direction.

435
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:49,005
And so it's clear that I have
to do work.

436
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:53,277
I have a force in this
direction and I move it in this

437
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:57,468
direction, and so I do positive
work.

438
00:32:57,468 --> 00:33:02,028
What happens with that work,
well, that comes out in the

439
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:06,009
form of heat in the resistance
of this conductor.

440
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:09,906
I'm creating an EMF.
A current is going to flow,

441
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:14,384
and the power is the EMF times
the current, I square R.

442
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:17,037
It comes out in the form of
heat.

443
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:21,93
If I change the direction when
I push in, velocity is now in

444
00:33:21,93 --> 00:33:25,413
this direction,
then clearly the current is

445
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:30,588
going to change direction.
And so when I push in,

446
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:35,27
the Lawrence force will also
flip over and so the force for

447
00:33:35,27 --> 00:33:39,145
me will flip over,
so again I have to do positive

448
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:42,051
work.
There's no such thing as a free

449
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:46,733
lunch, no matter what I do.
Whether I pull this way or push

450
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:51,576
in, I always have to do positive
work and that work is always

451
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:55,935
converted then to heat,
in the resistance of that loop.

452
00:33:55,935 --> 00:34:00,133
So the work that I do,
let me express it in terms of-

453
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:02,419
of
power.

454
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:10,337
The power that I generate is my
force, dot product with my

455
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:15,754
velocity and remember from eight
oh one.

456
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:22,977
The work that I do is force
over a little element dx.

457
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:30,2
But power is work per unit
time, so the dx dt becomes

458
00:34:30,2 --> 00:34:35,598
velocity.
And my force and my velocity

459
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:41,215
are always in the same direction
when I push there in this

460
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:46,141
direction, and when I pull there
in this direction.

461
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:50,969
I always do positive work.
And so the power that I

462
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,6
generate is my force.
That's the magnitude of my

463
00:34:55,6 --> 00:34:59,542
force, which is I L B times the
velocity.

464
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:04,173
But that must also be the EMF
times the current,

465
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:10,636
and notice now that the EMF
therefore I goes is L times B

466
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:13,56
times V.
And so now I have shown you

467
00:35:13,56 --> 00:35:18,323
that the EMF is exactly what I
er found before in terms of

468
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:22,166
magnitude by now I have not used
Faraday's Law.

469
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:26,845
This is purely a derivation
based off the work that I do,

470
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:31,441
and the work per unit time.
So it's interesting that you

471
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:36,12
can also think of it that way.
Let me check my equations.

472
00:35:36,12 --> 00:35:40,548
E I, I R squared,
I can live with that.

473
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:45,949
Power, force dotted with the
velocity.

474
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:54,414
I L B V, this is the magnitude
of the EMF, and that's fine.

475
00:35:54,414 --> 00:36:02,587
If I have a conducting disk,
solid disk, and I move that,

476
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:08,571
I try to move it through a
magnetic field,

477
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:16,179
north pole, south pole.
This is the magnetic field.

478
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:21,183
It's a little weaker here,
little weaker there.

479
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:25,861
I move this in.
Then there comes a time when

480
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:32,171
this disk is here that magnetic
field lines go through this

481
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:36,088
portion.
That means the magnetic flux

482
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:39,569
through this surface is
changing.

483
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:45,838
Lenz doesn't like that.
Farado- Faraday doesn't like

484
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,915
that.
And so what's going to happen,

485
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:53,046
the current is going to go
around now like this.

486
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:57,881
It's not so easy to precisely
determine how that current

487
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:01,661
exactly flows.
But this current will be seen

488
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:06,144
from above clockwise,
so that it produces a magnetic

489
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:10,979
field in this direction to
oppose the change in magnetic

490
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,056
flux.
And we call these current eddy

491
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:16,078
currents.
Eddy currents.

492
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:21,024
The eddy current produces
heat in here.

493
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:26,229
The heat is the product in
joules per second of the power E

494
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:29,55
times I.
I squared R always comes down

495
00:37:29,55 --> 00:37:34,127
to the same, so this disk will
heat up a little bit.

496
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:37,896
The resistance now is the
resistance there.

497
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:41,755
And that means that the disk
will slow down.

498
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:46,242
At the expense of kinetic
energy, heat is produced,

499
00:37:46,242 --> 00:37:51,35
and it won't go as
fast through this field than

500
00:37:51,35 --> 00:37:54,945
the situation would be if there
were no field.

501
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:57,661
And we call that magnetic
breaking.

502
00:37:57,661 --> 00:38:02,374
And you can easily convince
yourself, which you should do at

503
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:07,247
home, that if you look at the
current right here coming out of

504
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:12,279
the blackboard and you calculate
the Lawrence force right there,

505
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:16,833
you will see that the Lawrence
force is in this direction.

506
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:21,676
It's pushing it out.
It opposes the motion.

507
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:24,866
And I can demonstrate that to
you.

508
00:38:24,866 --> 00:38:29,798
I have here a pendulum.
The pendulum is a conducting

509
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:34,149
copper plate like so,
which I'm going to swing

510
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:37,726
between magnetic poles which are
here.

511
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:41,11
Going to swing it in this
direction.

512
00:38:41,11 --> 00:38:46,428
In fact, I have two pendulums,
one whereby this is solid

513
00:38:46,428 --> 00:38:52,809
copper, and I have another one
whereby it is

514
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:56,332
slotted, like teeth.
If I'm going to oscillate this

515
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:59,925
one in a magnetic field,
you're going to get current

516
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:03,448
there, eddy currents,
sometimes clockwise sometimes

517
00:39:03,448 --> 00:39:07,746
counterclockwise depending upon
how the magnetic flux for that

518
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:10,916
surface is changing.
Whether it moves into the

519
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:15,143
magnetic field or whether it
moves out of the magnetic field,

520
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:17,398
it will always oppose its
motion.

521
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:20,075
And so it will damp,
you will see that.

522
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:22,963
And it's at the expense of
kinetic energy,

523
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:26,866
heat will be produced
in this copper.

524
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:30,987
If you do it with something
like this, the damping will be

525
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:34,313
substantially less.
Not zero, but substantially

526
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:38,434
less, because now if there is an
EMF that wants to drive a

527
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:42,772
current, this current has to go
through this opening which is

528
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:46,098
air, which has a huge
resistance, and remember,

529
00:39:46,098 --> 00:39:49,713
power is E times I.
And if the- and it's I square R

530
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:53,617
and if the, if the current is
extremely low because the

531
00:39:53,617 --> 00:39:58,046
resistance is so
absurdly high then you don't

532
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:01,975
dissipate much power,
and so there's not much damping

533
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:05,905
and I can show that to you.
By the way, this damping,

534
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:10,287
this magnetic damping is used
sometimes for scales that you

535
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:14,67
weigh yourself on so that it
doesn't oscillate for too long

536
00:40:14,67 --> 00:40:18,523
so it damps very quickly.
So you're going to see the

537
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:22,15
oscillations there,
and it's going to be a little

538
00:40:22,15 --> 00:40:27,44
dark but that's the best way
that I can make you see it.

539
00:40:27,44 --> 00:40:30,343
Turn on the power.
So you see there,

540
00:40:30,343 --> 00:40:33,661
the loop -- I'll give you a
little light.

541
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:38,388
And first I will oscillate it
without any magnetic fields.

542
00:40:38,388 --> 00:40:42,37
I can power this magnet because
it has solenoids.

543
00:40:42,37 --> 00:40:46,186
So we'll just oscillate it,
no magnetic fields.

544
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:49,172
Give you a feeling how it
oscillates.

545
00:40:49,172 --> 00:40:53,651
What you see on the left is the
reflection, by the way,

546
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:59,291
against the magnetic poles.
So this gives you an idea of

547
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,681
how it oscillates.
And now I will turn on the

548
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:04,145
magnetic field,
now.

549
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:07,457
Just likes going into mud.
I'll do it again.

550
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:11,309
Oh, hitting the magnetic poles.
We don't want that.

551
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:13,003
Now, amazing,
isn't it?

552
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:17,471
And it doesn't matter whether
it goes in or whether it goes

553
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,859
out.
And now I will use the ones

554
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,941
with the teeth,
and you will see there is

555
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:27,177
damping, but it's substantially
less,

556
00:41:27,177 --> 00:41:32,514
so this is without  magnetic
fields.

557
00:41:32,514 --> 00:41:35,106
And now with,
now.

558
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:44,102
You can see there's damping,
but it's nowhere nearly as much

559
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:52,641
as there was on the one that
was- that didn't have teeth.

560
00:41:52,641 --> 00:42:00,418
I have here a remarkable
example of

561
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:04,497
how our economy is run.
I have there some windings,

562
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:07,923
not just some.
We don't even know how many,

563
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:11,921
thousands, copper wire going
around, going around,

564
00:42:11,921 --> 00:42:14,042
going around,
going around.

565
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:17,632
It's one wire,
and then there is a light bulb

566
00:42:17,632 --> 00:42:20,405
in that loop.
And here is a magnet.

567
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:24,974
We don't know the strength,
but I would say it's not more

568
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:28,237
than a kilogauss,
probably a little less.

569
00:42:28,237 --> 00:42:32,724
And when I move this between
these poles, magnetic field

570
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:36,725
let's say is
going in this direction.

571
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:39,238
I don't know whether it's in
this or that.

572
00:42:39,238 --> 00:42:42,732
I don't know the color code.
But there is a magnetic field

573
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:45,49
going through here,
so there's a change in the

574
00:42:45,49 --> 00:42:47,574
magnetic flux through this
surface.

575
00:42:47,574 --> 00:42:50,577
Very crazy surface.
If there are a thousand wires,

576
00:42:50,577 --> 00:42:53,274
this surface goes a thousand
times like this,

577
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:55,604
remember?
And then there is going to be

578
00:42:55,604 --> 00:42:58,117
an induced EMF,
and there's going to be an

579
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,12
induced current and this light
will glow a little.

580
00:43:01,12 --> 00:43:04,43
If I go in very slowly,
you just see teeny weeny little

581
00:43:04,43 --> 00:43:07,856
light.
If I go very fast,

582
00:43:07,856 --> 00:43:12,32
then the magnetic flux change
is high, high EMF,

583
00:43:12,32 --> 00:43:15,55
lot of light.
So I'll make it dark,

584
00:43:15,55 --> 00:43:18,589
darker, so that you can see
that.

585
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:23,339
Oh, we don't want this.
In fact, we don't need that

586
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:26,853
display at all.
So, if you can see me,

587
00:43:26,853 --> 00:43:32,742
I have it now and I'm going to
bring it near the magnetic poles

588
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:36,843
and I go very slowly.
I do it now.

589
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:39,106
You see?
I pull out, a little bit of

590
00:43:39,106 --> 00:43:41,499
light, I go in,
a little bit of light.

591
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,762
I'm right in now,
holding it steady,

592
00:43:43,762 --> 00:43:45,056
nothing happens.
Why?

593
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:48,936
Because there's no flux change.
Magnetic field is very strong

594
00:43:48,936 --> 00:43:52,493
now through these loops.
Faraday doesn't care how strong

595
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:54,886
it is.
He only cares about the change.

596
00:43:54,886 --> 00:43:57,214
I pull it out,
a little bit of light.

597
00:43:57,214 --> 00:43:59,284
Put it in, a little bit of
light.

598
00:43:59,284 --> 00:44:02,776
Whether I pull in or whether I
pull out doesn't matter.

599
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:05,945
If I do it very fast,
I may be able to generate so

600
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:10,565
much current that the bulb
may even blow.

601
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:14,625
I'll try that,
because I know you like the

602
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:17,992
idea of breaking things.
We all do.

603
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:22,448
You're not along.
Let's see whether I managed.

604
00:44:22,448 --> 00:44:25,121
Yes, I did.
It's broken now.

605
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:29,776
So you got something for your
money, didn't you.

606
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:34,826
That runs our economy.
Windings, conducting windings

607
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:41,757
that are being moved forcefully
through magnetic fields.

608
00:44:41,757 --> 00:44:46,998
Faraday was once interviewed by
reporters when he came up with

609
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:50,435
this law, and they said to him,
"So what?

610
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:55,761
So fine, so you moved a winding
through a magnetic field and so

611
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:58,768
you get a little bit of
electricity?

612
00:44:58,768 --> 00:45:03,407
So what?" And his answer was,
some day you will tax it.

613
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:06,071
And he was right.
He had vision.

614
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,992
The reporters didn't.
Part of life.

615
00:45:08,992 --> 00:45:14,53
I can show you another striking
example of, um,

616
00:45:14,53 --> 00:45:19,713
of magnetic breaking.
I have here a magnet which I

617
00:45:19,713 --> 00:45:25,637
can also power with solenoids,
and I have here two rings.

618
00:45:25,637 --> 00:45:31,772
One ring, which is complete in
the sense that it's like so,

619
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:36,849
a conducting ring.
I drop it through the magnetic

620
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:42,349
field and as the flux is
changing the eddy

621
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,82
current will flow in such a
direction that it will oppose

622
00:45:46,82 --> 00:45:51,37
the change, and so it could
either be in this direction or

623
00:45:51,37 --> 00:45:53,844
in this direction.
I don't know.

624
00:45:53,844 --> 00:45:56,798
But it will flow to oppose the
change.

625
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:59,831
And so as it enters the
magnetic field,

626
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:03,503
when the flux is increasing,
it will be damped.

627
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:07,574
When it is in the magnetic
field and the flux is not

628
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:12,922
changing very much anymore there
will be no damping,

629
00:46:12,922 --> 00:46:16,554
but when it comes out of the
magnetic field the flux is

630
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,84
changing again through the
surface.

631
00:46:18,84 --> 00:46:21,866
It will be damped again,
and you can see that.

632
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:25,901
And then I will throw through
there another ring which is the

633
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:29,129
same dimension but this ring has
an opening here.

634
00:46:29,129 --> 00:46:33,096
Air, the resistance is huge.
So the current that is going to

635
00:46:33,096 --> 00:46:36,324
flow, this eddy current,
is way lower because the

636
00:46:36,324 --> 00:46:40,157
resistance is so high and so
there is no power dissipation

637
00:46:40,157 --> 00:46:45,268
because I is so low and so there
is no heat produced at the

638
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:50,144
expense of kinetic energy,
so there is no damping.

639
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:53,527
There is no force,
no strong force,

640
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:57,508
that opposes it.
And I can show you both.

641
00:46:57,508 --> 00:47:01,588
And for this I need the DC
power on again,

642
00:47:01,588 --> 00:47:06,266
and we're going to project it
there on the wall.

643
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:11,241
I have to wait and see that I
get my carbon arc up.

644
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:15,72
There it comes.
So we're going to project this

645
00:47:15,72 --> 00:47:20,42
slot
which is the opening between

646
00:47:20,42 --> 00:47:24,734
the pole shoes on the wall
there, light off,

647
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:28,748
light off, all off.
And you see it there.

648
00:47:28,748 --> 00:47:33,163
This is that magnet.
And here comes the ring.

649
00:47:33,163 --> 00:47:39,283
The ring, that is going to be
decelerated heavily when it goes

650
00:47:39,283 --> 00:47:40,487
in.
Watch it.

651
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:45,203
Oh, small detail.
I forgot to turn the power on.

652
00:47:45,203 --> 00:47:50,922
[inaudible] There we go.
Power goes on now.

653
00:47:50,922 --> 00:47:56,012
Actually, you see now -- I did
that purposely -- you see now

654
00:47:56,012 --> 00:48:00,411
how fast it should go if there
is no magnetic field,

655
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:03,258
and now there is a magnetic
field.

656
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:06,535
Now, did you notice these three
phases?

657
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:10,331
You get damping,
and then when it is right in

658
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:14,558
the magnetic field,
when there is very little flux

659
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:19,561
change, then it picks up speed
again and then it slows down

660
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:21,372
again.
Watch it again.

661
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:26,674
Now, the one with the slot.
Amazing, huh?

662
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:31,656
Now one- once more th- one
without the slot.

663
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:36,639
Magnetic damping.
All of that result of eddy

664
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:42,317
currents, all of that the result
of Faraday's law.

665
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:47,994
Heat is produced at the expense
of kinetic energy.

666
00:48:47,994 --> 00:48:53,556
So if I summarize,
then when we create an induced

667
00:48:53,556 --> 00:49:00,985
EMF and we run a current,
we either have to change

668
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:05,875
magnetic fields in time,
or we have to change the area

669
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:10,027
in time, or we have to change
the angle theta,

670
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:15,193
but we must make a change in
the magnetic flux through an

671
00:49:15,193 --> 00:49:18,515
open surface.
And the energy that has

672
00:49:18,515 --> 00:49:21,744
dissipated must come from
somewhere.

673
00:49:21,744 --> 00:49:26,726
When you rotate the coils,
when you  power your dynamo,

674
00:49:26,726 --> 00:49:30,971
you have to do work.
When you move the crossbar

675
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:35,236
around,
you have to do work.

676
00:49:35,236 --> 00:49:39,803
When you move the coil as I did
there, in-between the magnetic

677
00:49:39,803 --> 00:49:43,471
poles to make the light glow,
you have to do work.

678
00:49:43,471 --> 00:49:48,038
You always experience a force
that is against the direction of

679
00:49:48,038 --> 00:49:52,305
your motion, which is another
manifestation of Lenz's Law.

680
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:56,498
And thank goodness it is that
way, because if it were the

681
00:49:56,498 --> 00:49:59,942
other way around,
our universe could not exist,

682
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:03,985
and I'll give you an example.
Suppose we have a growing

683
00:50:03,985 --> 00:50:06,983
magnetic
field somewhere.

684
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:10,437
And this growing magnetic field
creates an EMF,

685
00:50:10,437 --> 00:50:13,441
and suppose that EMF supports
the growth.

686
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:17,346
Then the EMF would produce a
stronger magnetic field,

687
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:21,701
and that keeps the EMF going in
exactly the same direction,

688
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:26,057
and so the B field would become
even stronger and you get a

689
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:29,211
runaway process.
Situation would get out of

690
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:32,139
control.
It would also be a violation of

691
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:37,555
the conservation of energy,
and thank goodness physics is

692
00:50:37,555 --> 00:50:40,873
the way it is,
because if it weren't that way

693
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:44,644
you and I wouldn't be here.
We couldn't even exist.

694
00:50:44,644 --> 50:50
See you Wednesday.
