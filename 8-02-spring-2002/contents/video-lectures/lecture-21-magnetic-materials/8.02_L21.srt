00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,03



2
00:00:00,03 --> 00:00:05,53
Yesterday we had two hundred
and twenty-five motors,

3
00:00:05,53 --> 00:00:11,678
and six of those motors went
faster than two thousand RPM,

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,561
which is a reasonable
accomplishment.

5
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:20,091
And the elite is here.
These are the elite,

6
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:23,326
the six highest.
The winner is,

7
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:27,964
um, Yungun Lee,
I talked to her on the phone

8
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:32,035
last night.
If all goes well,

9
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:34,216
she is here.
Are you here?

10
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:36,658
Where are you?
There you are.

11
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:41,803
Why don't you come up so that I
can con- congratulate you in

12
00:00:41,803 --> 00:00:44,158
person.
I thought about the,

13
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:48,257
the prize for a while,
and I decided to give you

14
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:52,094
something that is not
particularly high tech,

15
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:55,67
but come up here,
give me a European kiss,

16
00:00:55,67 --> 00:00:59,246
and another one -- in Europe,
we go three.

17
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:03,178
OK.
Um, the prize that I have for

18
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:07,378
you is a thermometer which goes
back to the days of Galileo

19
00:01:07,378 --> 00:01:10,782
Galilei -- come here.
Uh, it was designed in the

20
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:13,823
early part of the,
um, seventeenth century.

21
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,938
Uh, it doesn't,
uh, require any knowledge of

22
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:19,545
eight oh two to explain how it
works.

23
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:22,007
If anything,
you need eight oh one.

24
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:26,425
It's not a digital thermometer.
But it's accurate to about one

25
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:29,249
degree centigrade,
and if you come here,

26
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:32,798
you can tell,
you look at these

27
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:35,832
floaters, and the highest
floater indicates the

28
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:38,471
temperature.
It's now seventy-two degrees

29
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:40,846
here.
And I suggest that you brush up

30
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:44,673
on your knowledge of eight oh
one so that perhaps next week

31
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:46,916
you can explain to me how it
works.

32
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,159
[laughter].
And of course tell your

33
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,655
grandchildren about it.
You may want to leave it here.

34
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:55,822
It's very fragile.
Uh, there is also some package

35
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:58,593
material here,
so that you can take it home

36
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:01,76
without breaking it.
So congratulations once more

37
00:02:01,76 --> 00:02:05,93
[applause] and of course
-- [applause].

38
00:02:05,93 --> 00:02:09,363
Terrific.
And you will join us for dinner

39
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:13,998
on the thirteenth of April with
the other five winners.

40
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:18,29
Thank you very much.
There are two other people who

41
00:02:18,29 --> 00:02:21,551
are very special who I want to
mention.

42
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:25,499
And one is a person who is not
enrolled in, uh,

43
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:28,847
eight oh two,
but he did extremely well,

44
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:34,083
and he was very generous.
He was not competing.

45
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,359
His name is Daniel Wendel.
His motor went forty-nine

46
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,8
hundred RPM.
And then there was Tim Lo.

47
00:02:39,8 --> 00:02:43,333
Is Tim Lo in the audience?
I hope he's going to be there

48
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,16
at eleven o'clock.
Tim made a motor -- when I

49
00:02:46,16 --> 00:02:48,087
looked at it,
I said to myself,

50
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,528
it'll never run,
but it's so beautiful.

51
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,676
It was so artistic that we
introduced a new prize,

52
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:56,438
a second prize,
for the most artistic motor,

53
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:59,586
and Tim Lo definitely is the
one, by far the best,

54
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:02,477
the most beautiful,
the most terrific artistic

55
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:06,43
design.
And so for him I bought a book

56
00:03:06,43 --> 00:03:10,883
on modern art -- what else can
it be for someone who built such

57
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:14,403
a beautiful motor?
It is here for those of you who

58
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,138
want to see it later.
It's very hard to display it on

59
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:20,652
television because it's so
delicate.

60
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:24,889
It's like a birdcage that he
built instead of having just --

61
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,265
looks like that it's a birdcage.
It's very nice.

62
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:32,503
The winning motor I have here,
and I'm going to show you the

63
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,52
winning motor,
and I also want to teach you

64
00:03:35,52 --> 00:03:39,714
some,
some physics by demonstrating

65
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:44,625
the winning motor to you in a
way that you may never have

66
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,132
thought of.
So this is the winning motor.

67
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:53,043
And when we start this motor,
the ohmic resistance of the

68
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:58,304
current loop is extremely low.
So the moment that you connect

69
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:03,127
it with your power supply,
a very high current will run.

70
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:08,3
But the moment that the motor
starts to rotate,

71
00:04:08,3 --> 00:04:12,427
you have a continuous magnetic
flux change in these loops,

72
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:15,251
and so now the system will
fight itself,

73
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:19,378
and it will immediately kill
the current, which is another

74
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:21,767
striking example of Faraday's
Law.

75
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:25,894
I will show you the current of
this motor when I block the

76
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:29,876
rotor so that it cannot rotate.
It's about one point six

77
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:32,41
amperes.
And you will see the moment

78
00:04:32,41 --> 00:04:36,392
that I run the motor that that
current plunges by a huge

79
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,998
amount.
Striking example of Faraday's

80
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,532
Law.
So I now have to first show you

81
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,216
this
current, so here you see the

82
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:48,562
one and a half volts,
and on the right side you see

83
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,44
the current.
There is no current flowing now

84
00:04:51,44 --> 00:04:54,786
because the loop is hanging in
such a way that the,

85
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:57,53
that it makes no contact with
the battery.

86
00:04:57,53 --> 00:05:00,608
And I'm going to try to make it
-- there it is.

87
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:03,888
Do you see the one point six
amperes on the right?

88
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:07,903
The current is so high that due
to the internal resistance of

89
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:10,714
the power supply,
the voltage also plunges.

90
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:14,394
But you saw the one point six,
right?

91
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:18,872
Now I'm going to run the motor.
See, the motor is running now,

92
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:21,808
and now look at the current.
Current now,

93
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:24,67
forty milliamperes,
thirty milliamperes,

94
00:05:24,67 --> 00:05:28,047
fifty milliamperes.
It's forty times lower than

95
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:31,716
when I blocked the rotor.
And so this is one of the

96
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:36,047
reasons why when you have a,
a motor, whichever motor it is,

97
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:40,084
it could be just a drill,
you try not to block it all of

98
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:43,46
a sudden, because an enormous
current will run,

99
00:05:43,46 --> 00:05:48,17
and it can actually
damage the motors.

100
00:05:48,17 --> 00:05:55,175
So you see here how the current
goes down by a factor of forty

101
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:59,998
between running and not running.
All right.

102
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:06,429
Electric fields can induce
electric dipoles in materials,

103
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:11,826
and in case that the,
the molecules or the atoms

104
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:17,798
themselves are permanent
electric dipoles,

105
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:21,631
an external electric field will
make an attempt to align them.

106
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,402
We've discussed that in great
detail before when we discussed

107
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:27,728
dielectrics.
And the degree of success

108
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:31,499
depends entirely on how strong
the external electric field is

109
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:34,579
and on the temperature.
If the temperature is low,

110
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:38,287
you have very little thermal
agitation, then it is easier to

111
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:41,241
align those dipoles.
We have a similar situation

112
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:44,446
with magnetic fields.
If I have an external magnetic

113
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,651
field, this can induce in
material

114
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:51,073
magnetic dipoles.
And it, uh, induces magnetic

115
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:55,406
dipoles at the atomic scale.
Now in case that the atoms or

116
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:59,663
the molecules themselves have a
permanent magnetic dipole

117
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:04,3
moment, then this external field
will make an attempt to align

118
00:07:04,3 --> 00:07:07,265
these dipoles,
and the degree of success

119
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:10,686
depends on the strength of the
external field,

120
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:14,867
and again on the temperature.
The lower the temperature,

121
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:20,526
the easier it is to align them.
So the material modifies the

122
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:23,227
external field.
This external field,

123
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:26,546
today I will often call it the
vacuum field.

124
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,097
So when you bring material into
a vacuum field,

125
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:33,725
the field changes.
The field inside is different

126
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,276
from the external field,
from the vacuum field.

127
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:41,675
I first want to remind you of
our definition of a magnetic

128
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:44,995
dipole moment.
It's actually very simple how

129
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:49,086
it is defined.
If I have a current --

130
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:53,189
a loop could be a rectangle,
it doesn't have to be a circle

131
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,726
-- and if the current is running
in this direction,

132
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,122
seen from below clockwise,
and if this area is A,

133
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:04,509
then the magnetic dipole moment
is simply the current times the

134
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,985
area A.
But we define A according to

135
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:10,169
the, the vector A,
according to the right-hand

136
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,423
corkscrew rule.
If I come from below clockwise,

137
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:17,102
then the vector A is
perpendicular to the surface and

138
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:20,71
is then pointing upwards.
And so the magnetic dipole

139
00:08:20,71 --> 00:08:25,881
moment,
for which we normally write mu,

140
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:31,9
is then also pointing upwards.
And so this is a vector A,

141
00:08:31,9 --> 00:08:38,133
which is this normal according
to the right-hand corkscrew.

142
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:44,796
And if I have N of these loops,
then the magnetic dipole moment

143
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:50,17
will be N times larger.
Then they will support each

144
00:08:50,17 --> 00:08:54,684
other if they're all in the same
direction.

145
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:59,52
I first want to discuss with
you diamagnetism.

146
00:08:59,52 --> 00:09:03,477
Diamagnetism.
All materials,

147
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:07,245
when you expose them to an
external magnetic field,

148
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:10,713
will to some degree oppose that
external field.

149
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:13,878
And they will generate,
on an atomic scale,

150
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:17,119
an EMF which is opposing the
external field.

151
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,531
Now you will say,
yes, of course,

152
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:20,813
Lenz's Law.
Wrong.

153
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:23,526
It has nothing to do with
Lenz's Law.

154
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:27,823
It has nothing to do with the
free electrons in conductors

155
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:31,817
which produce an eddy current
when there is a changing

156
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:35,918
magnetic field.
I'm not talking about a

157
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:39,289
changing magnetic field,
I'm talking about a permanent

158
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,959
magnetic field.
So when I apply a permanent

159
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,994
magnetic field,
in all materials,

160
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:47,556
a magnetic dipole moment is
induced to oppose that field.

161
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:51,371
And there is no way that we can
understand that with eight oh

162
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,533
two.
It can only be understood with

163
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,649
quantum mechanics.
So we'll make no attempts to do

164
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,02
that, but we will accept it.
And so the magnetic field

165
00:10:00,02 --> 00:10:03,517
inside the material is always a
little bit smaller than,

166
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:08,993
than the external field,
because the dipoles will oppose

167
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:12,448
the external field.
Now I will talk about

168
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:14,867
paramagnetism.
Paramagnetism.

169
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:19,186
There are many substances
whereby the atoms and the

170
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:23,505
molecules themselves have a
magnetic dipole moment.

171
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:28,86
So the atoms themselves or the
molecules, you can think of them

172
00:10:28,86 --> 00:10:33,525
as being little magnets.
If you have no external field,

173
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:37,758
no vacuum field,
then these dipoles

174
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:41,217
are completely chaotically
oriented, and so the net el-

175
00:10:41,217 --> 00:10:44,293
magnetic field is zero.
So they are not permanent

176
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,727
magnets.
But the moment that you expose

177
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:50,507
them to an external magnetic
field, this magnetic field will

178
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:53,262
try to align them.
And the degree of success

179
00:10:53,262 --> 00:10:57,106
depends on the strength of that
field and on the temperature.

180
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:59,861
The lower the temperature,
the easier it is.

181
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:03,577
And so if you had a magnetic
field, say, like so -- this is

182
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:06,204
your B field,
this is your vacuum field --

183
00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:09,023
and you bring in there
paramagnetic material,

184
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:13,979
then there is the tendency
for the north pole to go a

185
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:18,243
little bit in this direction.
And so these atomic magnets,

186
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:22,73
then, would on average try to
get the north pole a little bit

187
00:11:22,73 --> 00:11:26,321
in this direction.
Or, if I speak the language of

188
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:30,36
magnetic dipole moments,
then the magnetic dipole would

189
00:11:30,36 --> 00:11:33,351
try to go a little bit in this
direction.

190
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:37,016
If you remove the external
field of a paramagnetic

191
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:40,906
material, immediately there is
complete, total chaos,

192
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:45,095
so there is no permanent
magnetism left.

193
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:49,488
If you bring paramagnetic
material in a non-uniform

194
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:53,354
magnetic field,
it will be pulled towards the

195
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:57,747
strong side of the field.
And this is very easy to,

196
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:02,228
to see how that works.
Suppose I have a magnet here,

197
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:07,676
and let this be the north pole
of the magnet and this the south

198
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,575
pole.
And so the magnetic field is

199
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:15,144
sort of like so.
Notice right here it's

200
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:18,512
very non-uniform.
And I bring some paramagnetic

201
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:21,806
material in there.
Let's say -- think of it as

202
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:24,588
just one atom there.
It's not to scale,

203
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:28,175
what I'm going to draw.
And here is that one atom,

204
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:30,884
and this one atom now is
paramagnetic,

205
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,373
has its own magnetic dipole
moment.

206
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:37,473
And this magnetic dipole
moment, now, would like to align

207
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:40,255
in this direction to support the
field.

208
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:45,086
The field is trying to push it
in that direction.

209
00:12:45,086 --> 00:12:47,847
Let's suppose it is in this
direction.

210
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:51,875
So if we look from above,
the current then in this atom

211
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:55,456
or in this molecule is running
in this direction.

212
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:57,395
Seen from above,
clockwise.

213
00:12:57,395 --> 00:13:01,275
So that would be ideal
alignment of this atom or this

214
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:05,527
molecule in that external field.
This current loop will be

215
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:08,958
attracted -- it wants to go
towards the magnet.

216
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,136
Let's look at this point here.
That point, the current is

217
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:18,019
going in the blackboard.
So here is that current I.

218
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,3
And the magnetic field is like
so, the external magnetic field

219
00:13:22,3 --> 00:13:24,967
is like so.
So in what direction is the

220
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:28,055
Lorentz force?
It's always in the direction I

221
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:29,599
cross B.
And I cross B,

222
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:33,669
I cross B is in this direction.
That's the direction of the

223
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:35,634
Lorentz force.
So right here,

224
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,862
there is a force on the loop in
this direction.

225
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:42,722
So therefore right here,
there is a force on the loop in

226
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:46,511
this direction,
on the current loop.

227
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:50,089
And so everywhere around this
loop, there is a force that is

228
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,999
pointing like this,
and so there clearly is a net

229
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,363
force up.
And so this matter wants to go

230
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:58,334
towards the magnet.
Another way of looking at this

231
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:01,85
is that this current loop is all
by itself a little magnet,

232
00:14:01,85 --> 00:14:05,367
whereby the south pole is here
and the north pole is there,

233
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:08,944
because this is the direction
of the magnetic dipole moment.

234
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,49
And the north pole attracts the
south pole.

235
00:14:11,49 --> 00:14:13,612
That's another way of looking
at it.

236
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:17,735
That's the reason why magnets
attract each other,

237
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:20,378
why north and south pole
attract each other,

238
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:23,206
and why north and north poles
repel each other.

239
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:26,341
That's exactly the reason.
It is the current that is

240
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:30,091
flowing, it is the Lorentz force
that causes the attraction or

241
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:32,98
the repelling force.
So paramagnetic material is

242
00:14:32,98 --> 00:14:36,238
attracted by a magnet.
Essential is that this field is

243
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:38,513
non-uniform.
And diamagnetic material,

244
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:41,955
of course, will be repelled,
will be pushed away from the

245
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:44,537
strong field,
because in paramagnetic -- in

246
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:47,734
diamagnetic material,
this current will be running in

247
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:52,888
the opposite direction,
because it opposes the external

248
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:55,97
field whereas paramagnetism
supports it.

249
00:14:55,97 --> 00:15:00,079
We have a third form,
and the third form of magnetism

250
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,398
-- it's actually the most
interesting -- is

251
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:06,954
ferromagnetism.
In the case of ferromagnetism,

252
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:11,695
we again have that the atoms
have themselves permanent dipole

253
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:14,54
moments.
But now, for very mysterious

254
00:15:14,54 --> 00:15:18,333
reasons which can only be
understood with quantum

255
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,995
mechanics, there are domains
which have the

256
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:26,404
dimensions of about a tenth of
a millimeter,

257
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:30,684
maybe three tenths of a
millimeter, whereby the dipoles

258
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:34,331
are hundred percent aligned.
And these dipoles,

259
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:38,215
domains, which are in one
direction, are uniformly

260
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:42,099
distributed throughout the
ferromagnetic material,

261
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:45,745
and so there may not be any net
magnetic field.

262
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:50,501
If I have here -- if I try to
make a sketch of those domains,

263
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:55,155
something like this,
then perhaps here all these

264
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,705
dipoles would all be hundred
percent aligned in this

265
00:15:58,705 --> 00:16:02,673
direction, but for instance
here, they will all be aligned

266
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:05,527
in this direction.
And the number of atoms

267
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:09,635
involved in such a domain is
typically ten to the seventeen,

268
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,349
maybe up to ten to the
twenty-one atoms.

269
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:16,317
So if now I apply an external
field, these domains will be

270
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:19,868
forced to go in the direction of
the magnetic field,

271
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:23,905
and of course the degree of
success depends on the strength

272
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:26,699
of
the external field,

273
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:30,83
the strength of the vacuum
field, and on the temperature.

274
00:16:30,83 --> 00:16:34,003
The lower the temperature,
the better it is,

275
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:37,248
because then there is less
thermal agitation,

276
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:41,675
which of course adds a certain
rando- randomness to the whole

277
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:44,257
process.
So when I apply an external

278
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:47,208
field, these domains as a whole
can flip.

279
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:51,339
Inside the ferromagnetic
material, the magnetic field can

280
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:55,322
be thousands of times stronger
than it

281
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:58,639
is in the vacuum field.
And we will see some examples

282
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,19
of that today.
If you remove the external

283
00:17:01,19 --> 00:17:03,422
field, in the case of
paramagnetism,

284
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,229
you have again complete chaos
of the dipoles.

285
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:09,481
That's not necessarily the case
with ferromagnetism.

286
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:13,244
Some of those domains may stay
aligned in the direction that

287
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:15,476
the external field was forcing
them.

288
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:18,538
If you very carefully remove
that external field,

289
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,982
undoubtedly some domains will
flip back, because of the

290
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:24,916
temperature, there is always
thermal agitation.

291
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:29,544
Some may remain oriented,
and therefore the material,

292
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:32,933
once it has been exposed to an
external magnetic field,

293
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,192
may have become permanently
magnetic.

294
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:39,02
And the only way you can remove
that permanent magnetism could

295
00:17:39,02 --> 00:17:42,471
be to bang on it with a hammer,
and then of course these

296
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:45,797
domains will then get very
nervous, and then they will

297
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:48,621
randomize themselves.
Or you can heat them up,

298
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:52,198
and then you can also undo the
orientation of the domains.

299
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:55,713
The domains themselves will
remain, but then they average

300
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:59,855
out not to produce any permanent
magnetic field.

301
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:03,627
So for the same reason that
paramagnetism is pulled towards

302
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:06,163
the strong field,
in case that we have a

303
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:09,806
non-uniform magnetic field,
ferromagnetism of course will

304
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:12,342
also be pulled towards the
strong field,

305
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,684
except in the case of
ferromagnetism,

306
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:18,131
the forces with which
ferromagnetic material is pulled

307
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,057
towards the magnet,
way larger than in case of

308
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:24,309
paramagnetic material.
If I take a paperclip -- you

309
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:27,626
can do that at home,
you can hang a paperclip on the

310
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:32,642
south pole of your magnet or the
north pole of your magnet --

311
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:35,373
you all have gotten magnets in
your motor kit,

312
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:38,103
so you can try that at home.
Take a paperclip,

313
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:41,197
hang it on the magnets.
Doesn't matter on which side

314
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:44,352
you hang it, because
ferromagnetic material is always

315
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:47,871
pulled towards the strong field.
If you hang a few of those

316
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:51,755
paperclips on there and you very
carefully and slowly remove them

317
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,456
-- don't hit them with a hammer
yet -- you may actually notice

318
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:59,157
that after you remove them that
the paperclips themselves have

319
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:01,826
become magnetic.
You can actually try to hang

320
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:05,08
them on
each other, make a little

321
00:19:05,08 --> 00:19:07,278
chain.
But drop them on the floor a

322
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:10,574
few times and that magendas-
magnetism will go away.

323
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:14,451
So what you have witnessed then
is that some of those domains

324
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:17,23
remained aligned due to your
external field.

325
00:19:17,23 --> 00:19:20,268
With paramagnetism,
there is no way that you can

326
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:24,339
hang paramagnetic material under
most circumstances on a magnet.

327
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,7
There is one exception.
I will show you the exception

328
00:19:27,7 --> 00:19:30,156
later today.
And the reason is that the

329
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:34,034
forces involved with
paramagnetic material

330
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:37,351
in general are only a few
percent of the weight of the

331
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,918
material itself.
So if you take a piece of

332
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:43,612
aluminum and you have a magnet,
aluminum will not stick to a

333
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:45,114
magnet.
There is a force.

334
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:48,933
Aluminum will be attracted by
the magnet, but the force is way

335
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:52,814
smaller than the weight of the
aluminum, so it won't be able to

336
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:56,758
pick it up, unlike ferromagnetic
material, which you can pick up

337
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:59,513
with a magnet.
So what I could demonstrate to

338
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:02,518
you, for one thing,
I could take a bar magnet and

339
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:06,525
show you that paperclips are
hanging on this.

340
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:10,876
I could also show you that
aluminum is not hanging on this.

341
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,652
But you won't find that very
exciting.

342
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:17,554
And therefore I decided on a
different demonstration,

343
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:22,056
whereby my goal is to show you
that ferromagnetic material is

344
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:26,332
pulled with huge forces towards
the strong magnetic field,

345
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:30,684
provided that I have a magnetic
field which is non-uniform.

346
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:35,261
And the way I will do that is
with this piece of ferromagnetic

347
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:39,462
material.
And this piece of ferromagnetic

348
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:41,593
material is actually quite
heavy.

349
00:20:41,593 --> 00:20:44,989
And you are going to tell the
class how heavy it is.

350
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:47,252
Be very careful.
What do you think?

351
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:48,384
Wow!
Good for you!

352
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:49,915
[laughter].
Do it again!

353
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,246
Sounds go-- looks great.
[laughter].

354
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:55,109
It's fifteen kilograms.
Fifteen kilograms of

355
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:58,571
ferromagnetic material.
It is not a permanent magnet.

356
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:02,099
There may be a little bit of
permanent magnetism left,

357
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,894
of course, because once you
have exposed it to an external

358
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:10,954
field, yes, there may be some
permanent magnetism left.

359
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:14,929
So now I'm going to hold this
-- let's first make sure that

360
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,67
nothing happens to Galileo's
thermometer.

361
00:21:17,67 --> 00:21:19,794
So we're going to put this
here.

362
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:23,357
See what the temperature is --
oh man, it's going up.

363
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:26,441
I must be sweating here.
Seventy-four degrees,

364
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:30,278
yeah, seventy-four degrees now.
OK, so here is my magnet,

365
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:33,156
producing about three hundred
twenty gauss.

366
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:36,993
But what counts is that the
magnetic field is non-uniform

367
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:40,214
here and also here.
And so I am going to turn on

368
00:21:40,214 --> 00:21:44,371
the
magnet -- I believe I have to

369
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:48,756
push a button here.
And the first thing I will do

370
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:53,049
is now power this magnet.
So this is a solenoid.

371
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,252
I put my hand in here,
my hand is paramagnetic,

372
00:21:57,252 --> 00:22:00,997
it's not being sucked in.
Really it isn't.

373
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:04,926
I feel nothing.
The force is -- I can't even

374
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:08,58
feel anything.
But I'm not ferromagnetic,

375
00:22:08,58 --> 00:22:11,138
thank goodness.
Now this one.

376
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:17,532
*Whssht*, fifteen kilograms,
just sucked in like that.

377
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:20,717
And I'm very lucky that when
it's overshoots here that it

378
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:23,333
wants to go back,
because it always wants to go

379
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,404
to the strongest field.
Doesn't matter whether you have

380
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:28,963
it here or there.
The reason why that's lucky,

381
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:32,319
because if that were not the
case, this fifteen kilogram bar

382
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,65
would go like a bullet coming
out of here.

383
00:22:34,65 --> 00:22:38,006
So the one thing you don't want
to do when it goes in there,

384
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:41,247
you don't want to break the
current, because then it would

385
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:44,091
come out as a bullet.
And I'm not going to do that,

386
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:46,423
believe me.
But I want to show you that --

387
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:47,958
there it goes.
It's amazing,

388
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,853
ferromagnetic
material.

389
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:51,794
*Aagh*.
OK.

390
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:56,405
So ferromagnetic material,
there's enormous force.

391
00:22:56,405 --> 00:23:01,77
If you have a s- a field that
is -- has a strong gradient,

392
00:23:01,77 --> 00:23:07,04
that it's very non-uniform,
is sucked, pulled towards the

393
00:23:07,04 --> 00:23:11,087
strong side.
That's why it hangs on magnets.

394
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:15,887
That's the basic idea.
I have another demonstration.

395
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:21,157
And another demonstration is to
make you sort of see in a

396
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:25,506
non-kosher way
magnetic domains.

397
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:29,007
But I will tell you why it's
non-kosher.

398
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:33,944
I have here an array of eight
by eight magnetic needles,

399
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:37,893
compass needles.
And you're going to see them

400
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:41,214
there.
And I will change the situation

401
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:46,331
so that you have better light.
And when I have an external

402
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:50,37
magnetic field and I march over
here a little,

403
00:23:50,37 --> 00:23:55,978
and I just let it go,
and wait, you will see areas

404
00:23:55,978 --> 00:24:01,352
whereby these magnetic needles
point in the same direction and

405
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:06,638
you will see areas where they
point in a different direction.

406
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:12,011
We'll just give it some chance.
And so that may make you think

407
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:16,064
that this is the way that
domains are formed in

408
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:20,292
ferromagnetic material.
Oh, in fact we have now a

409
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:26,282
situation that almost all are
aligned in this direction,

410
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:29,19
and there's only a group here
that is pointing in this

411
00:24:29,19 --> 00:24:30,726
direction.
I can change that,

412
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,976
of course, by changing the
magnetic field.

413
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:36,268
Why is this not really a kosher
demonstration to convince you

414
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,023
that domains exist?
First of all,

415
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:40,986
there is no thermal agitation,
whereas in ferromagnetic

416
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:42,906
material there is thermal
agitation.

417
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:45,704
Some may be oriented like this
and others like that,

418
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:48,393
where here you only have two
preferred directions.

419
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:50,642
You don't need quantum
mechanics for that,

420
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:53,275
simply a matter of minimum
energy considerations.

421
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:56,458
And so they either are pointed
like

422
00:24:56,458 --> 00:25:00,46
this or they are pointed like
that, and so already that shows

423
00:25:00,46 --> 00:25:03,662
you that it's very different
from ferromagnetism.

424
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:07,664
But the reason why we show it
to you is it still gives you an

425
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:11,2
interesting idea of the fact
that you can have various

426
00:25:11,2 --> 00:25:13,935
orientations and that they come
in groups.

427
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:17,737
That the groups stick together
and are not all in the same

428
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:19,338
direction.
But as I said,

429
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:23,207
it is not really a good way to
explain to you why there are

430
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:25,408
domains in ferromagnetic
material.

431
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:30,79
Ah, now you see again,
you have some nicely aligned

432
00:25:30,79 --> 00:25:35,704
here and others are in very
different direction here.

433
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:40,712
So the basic idea is there.
It's a nice demonstration,

434
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:45,91
but it shows you something that
really is not related to

435
00:25:45,91 --> 00:25:50,068
ferromagnetism.
The demonstration that is one

436
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:54,32
of my favorites,
one of my absolute favorites,

437
00:25:54,32 --> 00:25:58,856
is one whereby I can make you
listen

438
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:03,164
to the flip-over of these
domains.

439
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:08,776
I have ferromagnetic material
inside a coil.

440
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:15,562
I have here a coil and I'm
going to put ferromagnetic

441
00:26:15,562 --> 00:26:21,566
material in here.
And I have here a loudspeaker

442
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:27,7
-- an amplifier as well,
called it an amplifier.

443
00:26:27,7 --> 00:26:36,576
And this is a loudspeaker.
Let's first assume there is no

444
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,696
ferromagnetic material in
there.

445
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:41,775
That's the way I will start the
demonstration.

446
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:45,401
And I approach this with a
magnet, and I go very fast.

447
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:48,411
*Whssht*, what will happen?
Faraday will say,

448
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:52,448
oh, there's a magnetic flux
change, and there will be an EMF

449
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:55,116
in this coil.
That means there will be a

450
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:57,647
current in this coil,
induced current.

451
00:26:57,647 --> 00:27:01,342
And it will be amplified and
you will hear some sissing

452
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:03,326
noise.
And you will hear that.

453
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:05,652
If, however,
I come in very slowly,

454
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:10,502
you won't hear anything,
because D phi DT is then so

455
00:27:10,502 --> 00:27:13,913
low, because the time scale of
my motion is so large,

456
00:27:13,913 --> 00:27:15,947
that you won't hear any
current.

457
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:18,834
The induced current is
insignificantly small.

458
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:22,639
Because remember the induced
current is proportional to the

459
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:26,51
induced EMF, and the induced EMF
is proportional to the time

460
00:27:26,51 --> 00:27:30,315
change of the magnetic flux.
So I can make that flux change

461
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,268
very, very small if I bring it
in very slowly.

462
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:36,154
Now I will put in the
ferromagnetic material,

463
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,839
and I will approach it
again very slowly.

464
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,136
And now, there comes a time
that some of those domains go

465
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:45,845
*cluk*, *cluk*.
But when the domains flip over,

466
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:48,849
there is a magnetic flux change
inside the material,

467
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:51,558
and so the magnetic flux change
means D phi DT,

468
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:53,972
and it's on an extremely short
time scale.

469
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:57,329
And so now you get an EMF,
you get a current going through

470
00:27:57,329 --> 00:28:00,097
the wire, and you hear a
cracking noise over the

471
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,57
loudspeaker.
And for every group of domains

472
00:28:02,57 --> 00:28:05,868
that flip, you can hear that.
And that's an amazing thing

473
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:08,872
when you think about it,
that some ten to the twenty

474
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:12,903
atoms go
clunk and that you can hear

475
00:28:12,903 --> 00:28:15,921
that.
And so this is what we're going

476
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:20,449
to do here, and I will do it
then in, in several steps,

477
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:24,726
so that you first can hear the
noise if I don't have

478
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:28,919
ferromagnetic material,
and then -- so here is the,

479
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,441
here's the coil.
This is a very small coil.

480
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:36,801
And here is a magnet.
And I'll come very fast towards

481
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:40,155
the coil.
What you heard now is Faraday's

482
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:44,516
Law.
You simply have a magnetic flux

483
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:50,241
change in the coil -- oh,
I shouldn't touch it.

484
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:56,465
Now I come in very slowly,
and go away very slowly.

485
00:28:56,465 --> 00:29:01,692
You hear nothing.
D phi DT is just too low.

486
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:06,547
Now I put in the ferromagnetic
material.

487
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:12,895
Put it inside the coil.
And now I approach it again,

488
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:17,625
very slowly.
There they go.

489
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:21,919
You hear them?
Those are, those are domains

490
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,498
that go.
I'll come in with the other

491
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:27,441
side.
There it goes,

492
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:30,611
the domains.
Isn't that amazing?

493
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:34,496
You hear atoms switch,
groups of atoms.

494
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:38,893
I'll turn it over again.
Now they flip back.

495
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:42,574
They don't like it that that's
there.

496
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:47,892
This is called the Barkhausen
effect.

497
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:51,807
I find it truly amazing that
you hear groups of atoms,

498
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:55,575
ten to the twenty atoms at the
time, they flip over,

499
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:59,121
and when they do,
there is a magnetic flux change

500
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:03,258
inside the ferromagnetic
material, is sensed by the coil,

501
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:06,435
and you hear a current.
And if I do it fast,

502
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:09,39
uh, these, these,
these, these domains go

503
00:30:09,39 --> 00:30:11,237
haywire.
They go nuts now.

504
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:15,743
Imagine that you were a domain
and I would treat you that way.

505
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:18,034
You'd go *cluk*,
*cluk*, *cluk*,

506
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:22,794
*cluk*, *cluk*.
But the fact that you can hear

507
00:30:22,794 --> 00:30:25,342
it is absolutely amazing,
isn't it.

508
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:29,539
So that's actually a nice way
of demonstrating that these

509
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:32,087
domains exist.
If you did that with

510
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:36,059
faramagnetic- paramagnetic
material, you wouldn't hear

511
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,633
that.
So in all cases,

512
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:41,455
whether we have diamagnetic
material or paramagnetic

513
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:44,303
material or ferromagnetic
material, uh,

514
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:48,575
the magnetic field inside is
different from what the field

515
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:52,088
would
be without the material.

516
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:56,038
And what the field would be
without the material we've

517
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:59,765
called external field.
I've called it vacuum field.

518
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:03,269
And in many cases,
but not all -- next lecture I

519
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:07,89
will discuss the issues of not
all -- in many cases but not all

520
00:31:07,89 --> 00:31:12,214
cases, is the field inside the
material proportional to the

521
00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:14,972
vacuum field.
And if that is the case,

522
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:20,265
then you can write down that
the field inside is linearly

523
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:24,244
proportional -- so this is the
field inside the material,

524
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:28,223
regardless of whether it's
diamagnetic or paramagnetic or

525
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:31,279
ferromagnetic,
is proportional to the vacuum

526
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,695
field.
I will write down vacuum for

527
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:35,755
this.
And this proportionality

528
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:39,806
constant I call kappa of M.
I -- our book calls it K of M.

529
00:31:39,806 --> 00:31:42,719
And it's called the relative
permeability.

530
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:46,556
And so now we can look at these
values for the relative

531
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:50,322
permeability and we can
immediately understand now the

532
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:54,972
difference between
diamagnetic material,

533
00:31:54,972 --> 00:31:59,688
paramagnetic material,
and ferromagnetic material.

534
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:03,922
Since in the case of
diamagnetic material and

535
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:08,541
paramagnetic material,
the B field inside is only

536
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:12,39
slightly different from the
vacuum field,

537
00:32:12,39 --> 00:32:17,587
it is common to express kappa
of M in terms of one plus

538
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:23,746
something which we call the
magnetic susceptibility,

539
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:27,014
which is xi of M.
Because if it is very close to

540
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:30,143
one, then it is easier to simply
list xi of M.

541
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:32,785
And let's look at diamagnetic
material.

542
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:36,818
Notice that these values for xi
of M are all negative -- of

543
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:40,573
course, they have to be
negative, otherwise it wouldn't

544
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,702
be diamagnetic.
It means that the field inside

545
00:32:43,702 --> 00:32:47,11
is slightly, a hair smaller than
the vacuum field,

546
00:32:47,11 --> 00:32:50,934
because these induced dipoles
oppose the external field,

547
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,298
remember.
It has nothing to do with

548
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:56,688
Lenz's Law,
but they oppose it

549
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:59,801
nevertheless.
And so you express it in terms

550
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:02,335
of the, um, magnetic
susceptibility,

551
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:06,535
and so you have to take one
minus one point seven times ten

552
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:10,734
to the minus four to get kappa
of M, which is very close to

553
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:13,124
one.
If now you go to paramagnetic

554
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,875
materials, the minus signs
become plus.

555
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:20,002
Again, the numbers are small.
But the fact that it is plus

556
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:24,419
means that inside paramagnetic
material, the magnetic field is

557
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,331
a little, a
hair larger than the vacuum

558
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:30,076
field.
But now if you go to

559
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:33,432
ferromagnetic material,
it is really absurd to ever

560
00:33:33,432 --> 00:33:37,056
list the value for xi of M,
because xi of M is so large

561
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:41,15
that you can forget about the
one, and so xi of M is about the

562
00:33:41,15 --> 00:33:44,17
same as kappa of M.
And so you deal there with

563
00:33:44,17 --> 00:33:47,661
numbers that are a hundred,
a thousand, ten thousand,

564
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:49,875
and even larger than ten
thousand.

565
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,896
That means that if kappa of M
is ten thousand,

566
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,856
you would have a field inside
ferromagnetic material that is

567
00:33:56,856 --> 00:34:01,659
ten thousand times larger than
your vacuum field.

568
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:06,405
Next lecture I will tell you
that there is a limit to as far

569
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:09,139
as you can go,
but for now we will,

570
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:12,839
we will leave it with this.
So paramagnetic and

571
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:16,86
ferromagnetic properties depend
on the temperature.

572
00:34:16,86 --> 00:34:21,284
Diamagnetic properties do not
depend on the temperature.

573
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:25,788
So at very low temperatures,
there is very little thermal

574
00:34:25,788 --> 00:34:30,373
agitation, and so you can then
easier align

575
00:34:30,373 --> 00:34:33,911
these dipoles,
and so the values for kappa of

576
00:34:33,911 --> 00:34:38,092
M will then be different.
For ferromagnetic material,

577
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:41,792
if you cool it,
you expect the kappa of M going

578
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,847
up, so you got a stronger field
inside.

579
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:49,592
So it's temperature-dependent.
If you make the material very

580
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:54,498
hot, then it can lose completely
its ferromagnetic properties.

581
00:34:54,498 --> 00:34:59,081
What happens at a certain
temperature, that these dosmain-

582
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:02,538
domains fall
apart, so the domains

583
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:05,171
themselves no longer exist.
They annihilate.

584
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,987
And that happens at a very
precise temperature.

585
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:10,865
It's very strange.
That's also something that is

586
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:14,477
very difficult to understand,
and you need quantum mechanics

587
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:17,049
for that too.
But at a certain temperature,

588
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:20,416
which we call the Curie
temperature, which for iron is a

589
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:23,967
thousand forty-three degrees
Kelvin, which is seven hundred

590
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:27,273
seventy degrees centigrade,
all of a sudden the domains

591
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:30,151
disappear and the material
becomes paramagnetic.

592
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:34,756
In other words,
if ferromagnetic material would

593
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:39,68
be hanging on a magnet and you
would heat it up above the Curie

594
00:35:39,68 --> 00:35:43,969
point, it would fall off.
It would become paramagnetic,

595
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:48,178
but paramagnetic material in
general doesn't hang on a

596
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:52,229
magnet, because the forces
involved are quite small.

597
00:35:52,229 --> 00:35:56,994
And the change is very abrupt,
and I am going to show that to

598
00:35:56,994 --> 00:36:01,124
you with a demonstration.
I have a ferromagnetic nut.

599
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:04,777
It's right there.
You will see it very shortly.

600
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:09,134
And this nut,
or washer, hanging on a steel

601
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,47
cable, and there is here a
magnet.

602
00:36:11,47 --> 00:36:14,514
I don't know whether this is
north or south.

603
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:17,629
It doesn't matter.
And here we have a thermal

604
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:20,178
shield.
And so this washer is against

605
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,576
the thermal shield,
because it's being attracted.

606
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:26,975
It wants to go towards the
strong magnetic field.

607
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:30,231
It's ferromagnetic.
So it will be sitting here.

608
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:34,125
And now I'm going to heat this
up above the Curie point,

609
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:39,222
seven hundred seventy degrees
centigrade, and you will

610
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:43,732
see it fall off.
And when it cools again,

611
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:48,58
it goes back on again.
So I can make you see

612
00:36:48,58 --> 00:36:52,413
ferromagnetic properties
disappear.

613
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:57,712
And let me make sure I have the
proper settings.

614
00:36:57,712 --> 00:37:00,869
I see nothing.
I see nothing.

615
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:04,928
But there it is.
So here is this nut,

616
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:12,369
and here is this shield,
and the magnet is behind it,

617
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,945
you can't see it,
but it's right there.

618
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:21,309
And so it goes against it,
right, it goes just towards the

619
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:24,885
magnetic poles.
It goes into the strong

620
00:37:24,885 --> 00:37:28,273
magnetic field.
The magnetic field is

621
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:33,167
non-uniform outside a magnet,
and it goes towards it.

622
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,084
And so now I'm going to heat
it.

623
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:39,19
It will take a while,
because, um,

624
00:37:39,19 --> 00:37:45,025
seven hundred seventy degrees
centigrade is not

625
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:50,661
so easy to achieve.
The three most common

626
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:56,579
ferromagnetic materials are
cobalt, nickel,

627
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:01,652
and iron.
Nickel has a Curie point of

628
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:08,556
only three hundred fifty-eight
degrees centigrade,

629
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:16,87
so if this were nickel -- ooh.
If this were nickel -- uh-uh.

630
00:38:16,87 --> 00:38:21,676
[laughter].
Oh, you like that,

631
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:24,711
huh.
I think I need strong hands.

632
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:27,271
A strong hand is coming.
OK.

633
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,401
I think I fixed it.
I'm a big boy,

634
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:33,815
I did it myself today.
I lost my pen,

635
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:37,608
but that's a detail.
OK, let's try again.

636
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:42,634
So I'm going to heat it up,
and I was mentioning that,

637
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:49,367
um, nickel has a Curie point of
three hundred fifty-eight

638
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:52,529
degrees centigrade.
So that's quite low.

639
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:57,07
This is seven hundred seventy.
Cobalt is fourteen hundred

640
00:38:57,07 --> 00:39:01,53
degrees Kelvin Curie point.
Gadolinium is a very special

641
00:39:01,53 --> 00:39:04,693
material.
Gadolinium is ferromagnetic in

642
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:09,234
the winter, when the temperature
is below sixteen degrees

643
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:13,126
centigrade, but it is
paramagnetic in the summer,

644
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:17,667
when the temperature is above
sixteen degrees centigrade.

645
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:21,559
It's beginning to be red-hot
now.

646
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:26,147
Seven hundred seventy degrees
centigrade, you expect some

647
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:30,652
visible light in the form of red
light -- there it goes.

648
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:35,158
And I will keep it heating,
I will keep the torch on it,

649
00:39:35,158 --> 00:39:40,237
so that you can see that indeed
it's no longer attracted by the

650
00:39:40,237 --> 00:39:42,94
magnet.
And the moment that I stop

651
00:39:42,94 --> 00:39:45,971
heating it, it will very quickly
cool.

652
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:51,623
It will become ferromagnetic
again, and it will go back.

653
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:55,506
Just watch it.
There it goes.

654
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:59,805
So now it's again
ferromagnetic.

655
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:04,797
So the transition is extremely
sharp.

656
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:07,155
All right.
Uh, OK.

657
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:14,782
So paramagnetic materials,
as I mentioned several times,

658
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:19,496
in general cannot hang on a
magnet.

659
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:25,829
The attractive force is
there's not enough.

660
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,428
To hang on a magnet,
the force has to be larger than

661
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:32,181
its own weight.
And diamagn- diamagnetic

662
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:35,286
materials is of course
completely out because

663
00:40:35,286 --> 00:40:39,732
diamagnetic materials are always
pushed towards the weak part of

664
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:41,99
the field.
It's only paramagnetic

665
00:40:41,99 --> 00:40:45,8
materials and ferromagnetic
materials that experience a

666
00:40:45,8 --> 00:40:50,317
force towards the strong part of
the field if the field itself is

667
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:52,646
non-uniform.
Now there is one very

668
00:40:52,646 --> 00:40:57,504
interesting exception.
And I want to draw your

669
00:40:57,504 --> 00:41:01,044
attention to this,
um, transparency here.

670
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:04,319
Look here at oxygen at one
atmosphere.

671
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,629
Oxygen at one atmosphere and
three hundred degrees Kelvin has

672
00:41:09,629 --> 00:41:14,851
a value for xi of M which is two
times ten to the minus six.

673
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:19,63
But now look at liquid oxygen
at ninety degrees Kelvin.

674
00:41:19,63 --> 00:41:26,003
That value is eighteen hundred
times larger than this value.

675
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:29,032
Why is that so much higher?
Well, liquid,

676
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:33,349
in general, is about thousand
times denser than gas at one

677
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:36,53
atmosphere.
So you have thousand times more

678
00:41:36,53 --> 00:41:40,392
dipoles per cubic meter that in
principle can align.

679
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:44,028
And so clearly you expect an
immediate one-to-one

680
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:48,193
correspondence between the
density, how many dipoles you

681
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:51,904
have per cubic meter,
and the value for kappa M --

682
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:56,373
for xi of M.
And so you see indeed that this

683
00:41:56,373 --> 00:42:00,313
value is substantially larger.
The reason why it is more than

684
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:04,123
a factor of thousand higher is
that the temperature is also

685
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:06,159
lower.
You go from three hundred

686
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,574
degrees to ninety degrees,
and that gives you another

687
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:12,53
factor of two,
because when the temperature is

688
00:42:12,53 --> 00:42:16,34
lower, there is less thermal
agitation, and so the external

689
00:42:16,34 --> 00:42:18,901
field can align the dipoles more
easily.

690
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:22,382
And so that's why you end up
with a factor of eighteen

691
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:24,812
hundred.
Even though this value for xi

692
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:28,293
of M is extraordinarily high for
a

693
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:32,198
paramagnetic material,
notice that the field inside

694
00:42:32,198 --> 00:42:36,884
would only be point three five
percent higher than the vacuum

695
00:42:36,884 --> 00:42:41,336
field, because if xi of M is
three point five times ten to

696
00:42:41,336 --> 00:42:44,538
the minus three,
that means that the field

697
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:49,302
inside is only point three five
percent higher than the vacuum

698
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:52,036
field.
But that is enough for liquid

699
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,628
oxygen to be attracted by a very
strong magnet,

700
00:42:55,628 --> 00:43:01,669
provided that it also has a
very non-uniform field outside

701
00:43:01,669 --> 00:43:05,165
the magnet.
And so the force with which

702
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:10,962
liquid oxygen is pulled towards
a magnet can be made larger than

703
00:43:10,962 --> 00:43:16,759
the weight of the liquid oxygen.
And so I can make you see today

704
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:21,451
that I can have liquid oxygen
hanging from a magnet.

705
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:25,04
And that's what we are going to
do here.

706
00:43:25,04 --> 00:43:29,364
Make sure I have the right
setting.

707
00:43:29,364 --> 00:43:33,564
Ah, this is it.
Now we're going to have some

708
00:43:33,564 --> 00:43:38,057
changes in the lights.
So there you see the two

709
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:41,573
magnetic poles.
It's a electromagnet.

710
00:43:41,573 --> 00:43:46,262
And so we can turn the magnetic
field on at will.

711
00:43:46,262 --> 00:43:49,68
So here are the poles of the
magnet.

712
00:43:49,68 --> 00:43:53,978
And the first thing I will do
is very boring.

713
00:43:53,978 --> 00:43:58,763
I will throw some,
uh, liquid nitrogen between the

714
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:02,676
poles.
Now I don't have the value for

715
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:05,778
liquid nitrogen there,
but nitrogen is diamagnetic,

716
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:09,252
so it's not even an issue.
Diamagnetic material is pushed

717
00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:12,85
away from the strong field.
So even though the value for xi

718
00:44:12,85 --> 00:44:16,635
of M will be very different for
liquid nitrogen than it is for

719
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:18,806
gaseous nitrogen,
it doesn't matter.

720
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:20,915
So certainly it will be pushed
out.

721
00:44:20,915 --> 00:44:24,452
So that's the first thing I
want to do, just to bore you a

722
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:26,933
little bit.
Because I have to keep you on

723
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:31,835
the edge of your seat before
you're going to see this oxygen,

724
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:38,035
which will be hanging in there.
So let's first power this

725
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:43,46
magnet -- I hope I did that --
yes, I think I did.

726
00:44:43,46 --> 00:44:47,225
And here comes the liquid
nitrogen.

727
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:51,211
Boring like hell,
just falls through.

728
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:55,086
Now comes the oxygen.
Liquid oxygen.

729
00:44:55,086 --> 00:44:59,293
It's hanging in there.
I challenge you,

730
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:06,158
you've never in your life seen
liquid hanging on a magnet.

731
00:45:06,158 --> 00:45:10,442
You can tell your parents about
it -- and of course your

732
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:13,012
grandchildren.
It's hanging there.

733
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:17,452
I'll put some more in -- make
sure I have the right stuff,

734
00:45:17,452 --> 00:45:19,166
yeah.
Put some more in.

735
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:22,904
There is liquid oxygen.
When I break the current,

736
00:45:22,904 --> 00:45:26,565
it's no longer a magnet,
it will fall of course.

737
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:28,746
Don't worry,
you'll get more.

738
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:33,03
Who has ever in his life seen a
liquid hang on a magnet?

739
00:45:33,03 --> 00:45:37,537
It's paramagnetic,
it's not ferromagnetic,

740
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:41,906
but because the density is so
high and because it's so cold,

741
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:46,274
the value for xi of M is high
enough that the force on it is

742
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:50,42
larger than its own weight.
If you do this with aluminum,

743
00:45:50,42 --> 00:45:54,196
not a chance in the world.
Aluminum will not hang in

744
00:45:54,196 --> 00:45:57,824
there, even though aluminum,
as you can see there,

745
00:45:57,824 --> 00:46:01,23
is paramagnetic.
But the value two times ten to

746
00:46:01,23 --> 00:46:05,525
the minus five is way too small,
and it will not stick to a

747
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:07,456
magnet.
OK.

748
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:09,974
You have something to think
about.

749
00:46:09,974 --> 46:15
I will see you Friday.
