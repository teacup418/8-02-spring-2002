1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
Yesterday we had 225 motors,

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
and six of those motors went
faster than 2000 RPM,

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
which is a reasonable
accomplishment.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
And the elite is here.
These are the elite,

5
00:00:20 --> 00:00:26
the six highest.
The winner is,

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
um, Jung Eun Lee,
I talked to her on the phone

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:33
last night.
If all goes well,

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:38
she is here.
Are you here?

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
Where are you?
There you are.

10
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
Why don't you come up so that I
can con- congratulate you in

11
00:00:41 --> 00:00:47
person.
I thought about the,

12
00:00:44 --> 00:00:50
the prize for a while,
and I decided to give you

13
00:00:48 --> 00:00:54
something that is not
particularly high tech,

14
00:00:52 --> 00:00:58
but come up here,
give me a European kiss,

15
00:00:55 --> 00:01:01
and another one -- in Europe,
we go three.

16
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
OK.
Um, the prize that I have for

17
00:01:03 --> 00:01:09
you is a thermometer which goes
back to the days of Galileo

18
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
Galilei -- come here.
Uh, it was designed in the

19
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
early part of the,
um, seventeenth century.

20
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
Uh, it doesn't,
uh, require any knowledge of

21
00:01:16 --> 00:01:22
8.02 to explain how it
works.

22
00:01:19 --> 00:01:25
If anything,
you need 8.01.

23
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
It's not a digital thermometer.
But it's accurate to about 1

24
00:01:26 --> 00:01:32
degree centigrade,
and if you come here,

25
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
you can tell,
you look at these

26
00:01:32 --> 00:01:38
floaters, and the highest
floater indicates the

27
00:01:35 --> 00:01:41
temperature.
It's now 72 degrees

28
00:01:38 --> 00:01:44
here.
And I suggest that you brush up

29
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
on your knowledge of 8.01 so that perhaps next week

30
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
you can explain to me how it
works.

31
00:01:46 --> 00:01:52
[laughter].
And of course tell your

32
00:01:49 --> 00:01:55
grandchildren about it.
You may want to leave it here.

33
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
It's very fragile.
Uh, there is also some package

34
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
material here,
so that you can take it home

35
00:01:58 --> 00:02:04
without breaking it.
So congratulations once more

36
00:02:01 --> 00:02:07
[applause] and of course
-- [applause].

37
00:02:05 --> 00:02:11
Terrific.
And you will join us for dinner

38
00:02:09 --> 00:02:15
on the thirteenth of April with
the other five winners.

39
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
Thank you very much.
There are two other people who

40
00:02:18 --> 00:02:24
are very special who I want to
mention.

41
00:02:21 --> 00:02:27
And one is a person who is not
enrolled in, uh,

42
00:02:25 --> 00:02:31
8.02,
but he did extremely well,

43
00:02:28 --> 00:02:34
and he was very generous.
He was not competing.

44
00:02:34 --> 00:02:40
His name is Daniel Wendel.
His motor went 

45
00:02:37 --> 00:02:43
RPM.
And then there was Tim Lo.

46
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
Is Tim Lo in the audience?
I hope he's going to be there

47
00:02:43 --> 00:02:49
at eleven o'clock.
Tim made a motor -- when I

48
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
looked at it,
I said to myself,

49
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
it'll never run,
but it's so beautiful.

50
00:02:50 --> 00:02:56
It was so artistic that we
introduced a new prize,

51
00:02:53 --> 00:02:59
a second prize,
for the most artistic motor,

52
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
and Tim Lo definitely is the
one, by far the best,

53
00:02:59 --> 00:03:05
the most beautiful,
the most terrific artistic

54
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
design.
And so for him I bought a book

55
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
on modern art -- what else can
it be for someone who built such

56
00:03:10 --> 00:03:16
a beautiful motor?
It is here for those of you who

57
00:03:14 --> 00:03:20
want to see it later.
It's very hard to display it on

58
00:03:18 --> 00:03:24
television because it's so
delicate.

59
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
It's like a birdcage that he
built instead of having just --

60
00:03:24 --> 00:03:30
looks like that it's a birdcage.
It's very nice.

61
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
The winning motor I have here,
and I'm going to show you the

62
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
winning motor,
and I also want to teach you

63
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
some,
some physics by demonstrating

64
00:03:39 --> 00:03:45
the winning motor to you in a
way that you may never have

65
00:03:44 --> 00:03:50
thought of.
So this is the winning motor.

66
00:03:48 --> 00:03:54
And when we start this motor,
the ohmic resistance of the

67
00:03:53 --> 00:03:59
current loop is extremely low.
So the moment that you connect

68
00:03:58 --> 00:04:04
it with your power supply,
a very high current will run.

69
00:04:03 --> 00:04:09
But the moment that the motor
starts to rotate,

70
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
you have a continuous magnetic
flux change in these loops,

71
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
and so now the system will
fight itself,

72
00:04:15 --> 00:04:21
and it will immediately kill
the current, which is another

73
00:04:19 --> 00:04:25
striking example of Faraday's
Law.

74
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
I will show you the current of
this motor when I block the

75
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
rotor so that it cannot rotate.
It's about 1.6

76
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
amperes.
And you will see the moment

77
00:04:32 --> 00:04:38
that I run the motor that that
current plunges by a huge

78
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
amount.
Striking example of Faraday's

79
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
Law.
So I now have to first show you

80
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
this
current, so here you see the

81
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
1.5 volts,
and on the right side you see

82
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
the current.
There is no current flowing now

83
00:04:51 --> 00:04:57
because the loop is hanging in
such a way that the,

84
00:04:54 --> 00:05:00
that it makes no contact with
the battery.

85
00:04:57 --> 00:05:03
And I'm going to try to make it
-- there it is.

86
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
Do you see the 1.6
amperes on the right?

87
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
The current is so high that due
to the internal resistance of

88
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
the power supply,
the voltage also plunges.

89
00:05:10 --> 00:05:16
But you saw the 1.6,
right?

90
00:05:14 --> 00:05:20
Now I'm going to run the motor.
See, the motor is running now,

91
00:05:18 --> 00:05:24
and now look at the current.
Current now,

92
00:05:21 --> 00:05:27
forty milliamperes,
thirty milliamperes,

93
00:05:24 --> 00:05:30
fifty milliamperes.
It's forty times lower than

94
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
when I blocked the rotor.
And so this is one of the

95
00:05:31 --> 00:05:37
reasons why when you have a,
a motor, whichever motor it is,

96
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
it could be just a drill,
you try not to block it all of

97
00:05:40 --> 00:05:46
a sudden, because an enormous
current will run,

98
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
and it can actually
damage the motors.

99
00:05:48 --> 00:05:54
So you see here how the current
goes down by a factor of forty

100
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
between running and not running.
All right.

101
00:05:59 --> 00:06:05
Electric fields can induce
electric dipoles in materials,

102
00:06:06 --> 00:06:12
and in case that the,
the molecules or the atoms

103
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
themselves are permanent
electric dipoles,

104
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
an external electric field will
make an attempt to align them.

105
00:06:21 --> 00:06:27
We've discussed that in great
detail before when we discussed

106
00:06:25 --> 00:06:31
dielectrics.
And the degree of success

107
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
depends entirely on how strong
the external electric field is

108
00:06:31 --> 00:06:37
and on the temperature.
If the temperature is low,

109
00:06:34 --> 00:06:40
you have very little thermal
agitation, then it is easier to

110
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
align those dipoles.
We have a similar situation

111
00:06:41 --> 00:06:47
with magnetic fields.
If I have an external magnetic

112
00:06:44 --> 00:06:50
field, this can induce in
material

113
00:06:47 --> 00:06:53
magnetic dipoles.
And it, uh, induces magnetic

114
00:06:51 --> 00:06:57
dipoles at the atomic scale.
Now in case that the atoms or

115
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
the molecules themselves have a
permanent magnetic dipole

116
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
moment, then this external field
will make an attempt to align

117
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
these dipoles,
and the degree of success

118
00:07:07 --> 00:07:13
depends on the strength of the
external field,

119
00:07:10 --> 00:07:16
and again on the temperature.
The lower the temperature,

120
00:07:14 --> 00:07:20
the easier it is to align them.
So the material modifies the

121
00:07:20 --> 00:07:26
external field.
This external field,

122
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
today I will often call it the
vacuum field.

123
00:07:26 --> 00:07:32
So when you bring material into
a vacuum field,

124
00:07:30 --> 00:07:36
the field changes.
The field inside is different

125
00:07:33 --> 00:07:39
from the external field,
from the vacuum field.

126
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
I first want to remind you of
our definition of a magnetic

127
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47
dipole moment.
It's actually very simple how

128
00:07:44 --> 00:07:50
it is defined.
If I have a current --

129
00:07:49 --> 00:07:55
a loop, could be a rectangle,
it doesn't have to be a circle

130
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
-- and if the current is running
in this direction,

131
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
seen from below clockwise,
and if this area is A,

132
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
then the magnetic dipole moment
is simply the current times the

133
00:08:04 --> 00:08:10
area A.
But we define A according to

134
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
the, the vector A,
according to the right-hand

135
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
corkscrew rule.
If I come from below clockwise,

136
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
then the vector A is
perpendicular to the surface and

137
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
is then pointing upwards.
And so the magnetic dipole

138
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
moment,
for which we normally write mu,

139
00:08:25 --> 00:08:31
is then also pointing upwards.
And so this is a vector A,

140
00:08:31 --> 00:08:37
which is this normal according
to the right-hand corkscrew.

141
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
And if I have N of these loops,
then the magnetic dipole moment

142
00:08:44 --> 00:08:50
will be N times larger.
Then they will support each

143
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
other if they're all in the same
direction.

144
00:08:54 --> 00:09:00
I first want to discuss with
you diamagnetism.

145
00:08:59 --> 00:09:05
Diamagnetism.
All materials,

146
00:09:03 --> 00:09:09
when you expose them to an
external magnetic field,

147
00:09:07 --> 00:09:13
will to some degree oppose that
external field.

148
00:09:10 --> 00:09:16
And they will generate,
on an atomic scale,

149
00:09:13 --> 00:09:19
an EMF which is opposing the
external field.

150
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
Now you will say,
yes, of course,

151
00:09:19 --> 00:09:25
Lenz's Law.
Wrong.

152
00:09:20 --> 00:09:26
It has nothing to do with
Lenz's Law.

153
00:09:23 --> 00:09:29
It has nothing to do with the
free electrons in conductors

154
00:09:27 --> 00:09:33
which produce an eddy current
when there is a changing

155
00:09:31 --> 00:09:37
magnetic field.
I'm not talking about a

156
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
changing magnetic field,
I'm talking about a permanent

157
00:09:39 --> 00:09:45
magnetic field.
So when I apply a permanent

158
00:09:41 --> 00:09:47
magnetic field,
in all materials,

159
00:09:43 --> 00:09:49
a magnetic dipole moment is
induced to oppose that field.

160
00:09:47 --> 00:09:53
And there is no way that we can
understand that with 8.02

161
00:09:51 --> 00:09:57
It can only be understood with

162
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
quantum mechanics.
So we'll make no attempts to do

163
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
that, but we will accept it.
And so the magnetic field

164
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
inside the material is always a
little bit smaller than,

165
00:10:03 --> 00:10:09
than the external field,
because the dipoles will oppose

166
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
the external field.
Now I will talk about

167
00:10:12 --> 00:10:18
paramagnetism.
Paramagnetism.

168
00:10:14 --> 00:10:20
There are many substances
whereby the atoms and the

169
00:10:19 --> 00:10:25
molecules themselves have a
magnetic dipole moment.

170
00:10:23 --> 00:10:29
So the atoms themselves or the
molecules, you can think of them

171
00:10:28 --> 00:10:34
as being little magnets.
If you have no external field,

172
00:10:33 --> 00:10:39
no vacuum field,
then these dipoles

173
00:10:37 --> 00:10:43
are completely chaotically
oriented, and so the net el-

174
00:10:41 --> 00:10:47
magnetic field is 0.
So they are not permanent

175
00:10:44 --> 00:10:50
magnets.
But the moment that you expose

176
00:10:46 --> 00:10:52
them to an external magnetic
field, this magnetic field will

177
00:10:50 --> 00:10:56
try to align them.
And the degree of success

178
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
depends on the strength of that
field and on the temperature.

179
00:10:57 --> 00:11:03
The lower the temperature,
the easier it is.

180
00:10:59 --> 00:11:05
And so if you had a magnetic
field, say, like so -- this is

181
00:11:03 --> 00:11:09
your B field,
this is your vacuum field --

182
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
and you bring in there
paramagnetic material,

183
00:11:09 --> 00:11:15
then there is the tendency
for the north pole to go a

184
00:11:13 --> 00:11:19
little bit in this direction.
And so these atomic magnets,

185
00:11:18 --> 00:11:24
then, would on average try to
get the north pole a little bit

186
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
in this direction.
Or, if I speak the language of

187
00:11:26 --> 00:11:32
magnetic dipole moments,
then the magnetic dipole would

188
00:11:30 --> 00:11:36
try to go a little bit in this
direction.

189
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
If you remove the external
field of a paramagnetic

190
00:11:37 --> 00:11:43
material, immediately there is
complete, total chaos,

191
00:11:40 --> 00:11:46
so there is no permanent
magnetism left.

192
00:11:45 --> 00:11:51
If you bring paramagnetic
material in a non-uniform

193
00:11:49 --> 00:11:55
magnetic field,
it will be pulled towards the

194
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
strong side of the field.
And it is very easy to,

195
00:11:57 --> 00:12:03
to see how that works.
Suppose I have a magnet here,

196
00:12:02 --> 00:12:08
and let this be the north pole
of the magnet and this the south

197
00:12:07 --> 00:12:13
pole.
And so the magnetic field is

198
00:12:10 --> 00:12:16
sort of like so.
Notice right here it's

199
00:12:15 --> 00:12:21
very non-uniform.
And I bring some paramagnetic

200
00:12:18 --> 00:12:24
material in there.
Let's say -- think of it as

201
00:12:21 --> 00:12:27
just one atom there.
It's not to scale,

202
00:12:24 --> 00:12:30
what I'm going to draw.
And here is that one atom,

203
00:12:28 --> 00:12:34
and this one atom now is
paramagnetic,

204
00:12:30 --> 00:12:36
has its own magnetic dipole
moment.

205
00:12:33 --> 00:12:39
And this magnetic dipole
moment, now, would like to align

206
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
in this direction to support the
field.

207
00:12:40 --> 00:12:46
The field is trying to push it
in that direction.

208
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
Let's suppose it is in this
direction.

209
00:12:47 --> 00:12:53
So if we look from above,
the current then in this atom

210
00:12:51 --> 00:12:57
or in this molecule is running
in this direction.

211
00:12:55 --> 00:13:01
Seen from above,
clockwise.

212
00:12:57 --> 00:13:03
So that would be ideal
alignment of this atom or this

213
00:13:01 --> 00:13:07
molecule in that external field.
This current loop will be

214
00:13:05 --> 00:13:11
attracted -- it wants to go
towards the magnet.

215
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
Let's look at this point here.
That point, the current is

216
00:13:13 --> 00:13:19
going in the blackboard.
So here is that current I.

217
00:13:18 --> 00:13:24
And the magnetic field is like
so, the external magnetic field

218
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
is like so.
So in what direction is the

219
00:13:24 --> 00:13:30
Lorentz force?
It's always in the direction I

220
00:13:28 --> 00:13:34
cross B.
And I cross B,

221
00:13:29 --> 00:13:35
I cross B is in this direction.
That's the direction of the

222
00:13:33 --> 00:13:39
Lorentz force.
So right here,

223
00:13:35 --> 00:13:41
there is a force on the loop in
this direction.

224
00:13:38 --> 00:13:44
So therefore right here,
there is a force on the loop in

225
00:13:42 --> 00:13:48
this direction,
on the current loop.

226
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52
And so everywhere around this
loop, there is a force that is

227
00:13:50 --> 00:13:56
pointing like this,
and so there clearly is a net

228
00:13:52 --> 00:13:58
force up.
And so this metal wants to go

229
00:13:55 --> 00:14:01
towards the magnet.
Another way of looking at this

230
00:13:58 --> 00:14:04
is that this current loop is all
by itself a little magnet,

231
00:14:01 --> 00:14:07
whereby the south pole is here
and the north pole is there,

232
00:14:05 --> 00:14:11
because this is the direction
of the magnetic dipole moment.

233
00:14:08 --> 00:14:14
And the north pole attracts the
south pole.

234
00:14:11 --> 00:14:17
That's another way of looking
at it.

235
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
That's the reason why magnets
attract each other,

236
00:14:17 --> 00:14:23
why north and south pole
attract each other,

237
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
and why north and north poles
repel each other.

238
00:14:23 --> 00:14:29
That's exactly the reason.
It is the current that is

239
00:14:26 --> 00:14:32
flowing, it is the Lorentz force
that causes the attraction or

240
00:14:30 --> 00:14:36
the repelling force.
So paramagnetic material is

241
00:14:32 --> 00:14:38
attracted by a magnet.
Essential is that this field is

242
00:14:36 --> 00:14:42
non-uniform.
And diamagnetic material,

243
00:14:38 --> 00:14:44
of course, will be repelled,
will be pushed away from the

244
00:14:41 --> 00:14:47
strong field,
because in paramagnetic -- in

245
00:14:44 --> 00:14:50
diamagnetic material,
this current would be running in

246
00:14:47 --> 00:14:53
the opposite direction,
because it opposes the external

247
00:14:52 --> 00:14:58
field whereas paramagnetism
supports it.

248
00:14:55 --> 00:15:01
We have a third form,
and the third form of magnetism

249
00:15:00 --> 00:15:06
-- it's actually the most
interesting -- is

250
00:15:03 --> 00:15:09
ferromagnetism.
In the case of ferromagnetism,

251
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
we again have that the atoms
have themselves permanent dipole

252
00:15:11 --> 00:15:17
moments.
But now, for very mysterious

253
00:15:14 --> 00:15:20
reasons which can only be
understood with quantum

254
00:15:18 --> 00:15:24
mechanics, there are domains
which have the

255
00:15:22 --> 00:15:28
dimensions of about 1/10 of
a millimeter,

256
00:15:26 --> 00:15:32
maybe 3/10 of a
millimeter, whereby the dipoles

257
00:15:30 --> 00:15:36
are hundred percent aligned.
And these dipoles,

258
00:15:34 --> 00:15:40
domains, which are in one
direction, are uniformly

259
00:15:38 --> 00:15:44
distributed throughout the
ferromagnetic material,

260
00:15:42 --> 00:15:48
and so there may not be any net
magnetic field.

261
00:15:45 --> 00:15:51
If I have here -- if I try to
make a sketch of those domains,

262
00:15:50 --> 00:15:56
something like this,
then perhaps here all these

263
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01
dipoles would all be hundred
percent aligned in this

264
00:15:58 --> 00:16:04
direction, but for instance
here, they will all be aligned

265
00:16:02 --> 00:16:08
in this direction.
And the number of atoms

266
00:16:05 --> 00:16:11
involved in such a domain is
typically 10 to the 17,

267
00:16:09 --> 00:16:15
maybe up to 10 to the
21 atoms.

268
00:16:12 --> 00:16:18
So if now I apply an external
field, these domains will be

269
00:16:16 --> 00:16:22
forced to go in the direction of
the magnetic field,

270
00:16:19 --> 00:16:25
and of course the degree of
success depends on the strength

271
00:16:23 --> 00:16:29
of
the external field,

272
00:16:26 --> 00:16:32
the strength of the vacuum
field, and on the temperature.

273
00:16:30 --> 00:16:36
The lower the temperature,
the better it is,

274
00:16:34 --> 00:16:40
because then there is less
thermal agitation,

275
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43
which of course adds a certain
rando- randomness to the whole

276
00:16:41 --> 00:16:47
process.
So when I apply an external

277
00:16:44 --> 00:16:50
field, these domains as a whole
can flip.

278
00:16:47 --> 00:16:53
Inside the ferromagnetic
material, the magnetic field can

279
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
be thousands of times stronger
than it

280
00:16:55 --> 00:17:01
is in the vacuum field.
And we will see some examples

281
00:16:58 --> 00:17:04
of that today.
If you remove the external

282
00:17:01 --> 00:17:07
field, in the case of
paramagnetism,

283
00:17:03 --> 00:17:09
you have again complete chaos
of the dipoles.

284
00:17:06 --> 00:17:12
That's not necessarily the case
with ferromagnetism.

285
00:17:09 --> 00:17:15
Some of those domains may stay
aligned in the direction that

286
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
the external field was forcing
them.

287
00:17:15 --> 00:17:21
If you very carefully remove
that external field,

288
00:17:18 --> 00:17:24
undoubtedly some domains will
flip back, because of the

289
00:17:21 --> 00:17:27
temperature, there is always
thermal agitation.

290
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30
Some may remain oriented,
and therefore the material,

291
00:17:29 --> 00:17:35
once it has been exposed to an
external magnetic field,

292
00:17:32 --> 00:17:38
may have become permanently
magnetic.

293
00:17:35 --> 00:17:41
And the only way you can remove
that permanent magnetism could

294
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
be to bang on it with a hammer,
and then of course these

295
00:17:42 --> 00:17:48
domains will then get very
nervous, and then they will

296
00:17:45 --> 00:17:51
randomize themselves.
Or you can heat them up,

297
00:17:48 --> 00:17:54
and then you can also undo the
orientation of the domains.

298
00:17:52 --> 00:17:58
The domains themselves will
remain, but then they average

299
00:17:55 --> 00:18:01
out not to produce any permanent
magnetic field.

300
00:17:59 --> 00:18:05
So for the same reason that
paramagnetism is pulled towards

301
00:18:03 --> 00:18:09
the strong field,
in case that we have a

302
00:18:06 --> 00:18:12
non-uniform magnetic field,
ferromagnetism of course will

303
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
also be pulled towards the
strong field,

304
00:18:12 --> 00:18:18
except in the case of
ferromagnetism,

305
00:18:14 --> 00:18:20
the forces with which
ferromagnetic material is pulled

306
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
towards the magnet,
way larger than in case of

307
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
paramagnetic material.
If I take a paperclip -- you

308
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
can do that at home,
you can hang a paperclip on the

309
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
south pole of your magnet or the
north pole of your magnet --

310
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
you all have gotten magnets in
your motor kit,

311
00:18:35 --> 00:18:41
so you can try that at home.
Take a paperclip,

312
00:18:38 --> 00:18:44
hang it on the magnet.
Doesn't matter on which side

313
00:18:41 --> 00:18:47
you hang it, because
ferromagnetic material is always

314
00:18:44 --> 00:18:50
pulled towards the strong field.
If you hang a few of those

315
00:18:47 --> 00:18:53
paperclips on there and you very
carefully and slowly remove them

316
00:18:51 --> 00:18:57
-- don't hit them with a hammer
yet -- you may actually notice

317
00:18:55 --> 00:19:01
that after you remove them that
the paperclips themselves have

318
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
become magnetic.
You can actually try to hang

319
00:19:01 --> 00:19:07
them on
each other, make a little

320
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
chain.
But drop them on the floor a

321
00:19:07 --> 00:19:13
few times and that magendas-
magnetism will go away.

322
00:19:10 --> 00:19:16
So what you have witnessed then
is that some of those domains

323
00:19:14 --> 00:19:20
remained aligned due to your
external field.

324
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
With paramagnetism,
there is no way that you can

325
00:19:20 --> 00:19:26
hang paramagnetic material under
most circumstances on a magnet.

326
00:19:24 --> 00:19:30
There is one exception.
I will show you the exception

327
00:19:27 --> 00:19:33
later today.
And the reason is that the

328
00:19:30 --> 00:19:36
forces involved with
paramagnetic material

329
00:19:34 --> 00:19:40
in general are only a few
percent of the weight of the

330
00:19:37 --> 00:19:43
material itself.
So if you take a piece of

331
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
aluminum and you have a magnet,
aluminum will not stick to a

332
00:19:43 --> 00:19:49
magnet.
There is a force.

333
00:19:45 --> 00:19:51
Aluminum will be attracted by
the magnet, but the force is way

334
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
smaller than the weight of the
aluminum, so it won't be able to

335
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
pick it up, unlike ferromagnetic
material, which you can pick up

336
00:19:56 --> 00:20:02
with a magnet.
So what I could demonstrate to

337
00:19:59 --> 00:20:05
you, for one thing,
I could take a bar magnet and

338
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
show you that paperclips are
hanging on this.

339
00:20:06 --> 00:20:12
I could also show you that
aluminum is not hanging on this.

340
00:20:10 --> 00:20:16
But you won't find that very
exciting.

341
00:20:13 --> 00:20:19
And therefore I decided on a
different demonstration,

342
00:20:17 --> 00:20:23
whereby my goal is to show you
that ferromagnetic material is

343
00:20:22 --> 00:20:28
pulled with huge forces towards
the strong magnetic field,

344
00:20:26 --> 00:20:32
provided that I have a magnetic
field which is non-uniform.

345
00:20:30 --> 00:20:36
And the way I will do that is
with this piece of ferromagnetic

346
00:20:35 --> 00:20:41
material.
And this piece of ferromagnetic

347
00:20:39 --> 00:20:45
material is actually quite
heavy.

348
00:20:41 --> 00:20:47
And you are going to tell the
class how heavy it is.

349
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
Be very careful.
What do you think?

350
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
Wow!
Good for you!

351
00:20:48 --> 00:20:54
[laughter].
Do it again!

352
00:20:49 --> 00:20:55
Sounds go-- looks great.
[laughter].

353
00:20:52 --> 00:20:58
It's fifteen kilograms.
Fifteen kilograms of

354
00:20:55 --> 00:21:01
ferromagnetic material.
It is not a permanent magnet.

355
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
There may be a little bit of
permanent magnetism left,

356
00:21:02 --> 00:21:08
of course, because once you
have exposed it to an external

357
00:21:05 --> 00:21:11
field, yes, there may be some
permanent magnetism left.

358
00:21:10 --> 00:21:16
So now I'm going to hold this
-- let's first make sure that

359
00:21:14 --> 00:21:20
nothing happens to Galileo's
thermometer.

360
00:21:17 --> 00:21:23
So we're going to put this
here.

361
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
See what the temperature is --
oh man, it's going up.

362
00:21:23 --> 00:21:29
I must be sweating here.
74 degrees,

363
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
yeah, 74 degrees now.
OK, so here is my magnet,

364
00:21:30 --> 00:21:36
gau
producing about 320 gauss.

365
00:21:33 --> 00:21:39
But what counts is that the
magnetic field is non-uniform

366
00:21:36 --> 00:21:42
here and also here.
And so I am going to turn on

367
00:21:40 --> 00:21:46
the
magnet -- I believe I have to

368
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
push a button here.
And the first thing I will do

369
00:21:48 --> 00:21:54
is now power this magnet.
So this is a solenoid.

370
00:21:53 --> 00:21:59
I put my hand in here,
my hand is paramagnetic,

371
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
it's not being sucked in.
Really it isn't.

372
00:22:00 --> 00:22:06
I feel nothing.
The force is -- I can't even

373
00:22:04 --> 00:22:10
feel anything.
But I'm not ferromagnetic,

374
00:22:08 --> 00:22:14
thank goodness.
Now this one.

375
00:22:11 --> 00:22:17
*Whssht*, fifteen kilograms,
just sucked in like that.

376
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
And I'm very lucky that when
it's overshoots here that it

377
00:22:20 --> 00:22:26
wants to go back,
because it always wants to go

378
00:22:23 --> 00:22:29
to the strongest field.
Doesn't matter whether you have

379
00:22:26 --> 00:22:32
it here or there.
The reason why that's lucky,

380
00:22:28 --> 00:22:34
because if that were not the
case, this fifteen kilogram bar

381
00:22:32 --> 00:22:38
would go like a bullet coming
out of here.

382
00:22:34 --> 00:22:40
So the one thing you don't want
to do when it goes in there,

383
00:22:38 --> 00:22:44
you don't want to break the
current, because then it would

384
00:22:41 --> 00:22:47
come out as a bullet.
And I'm not going to do that,

385
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
believe me.
But I want to show you that --

386
00:22:46 --> 00:22:52
there it goes.
It's amazing,

387
00:22:47 --> 00:22:53
ferromagnetic
material.

388
00:22:50 --> 00:22:56
*Aagh*.
OK.

389
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57
So ferromagnetic material,
there's enormous force.

390
00:22:56 --> 00:23:02
If you have a s- a field that
is -- has a strong gradient,

391
00:23:01 --> 00:23:07
that is very non-uniform,
is sucked, pulled towards the

392
00:23:07 --> 00:23:13
strong side.
That's why it hangs on magnets.

393
00:23:11 --> 00:23:17
That's the basic idea.
I have another demonstration.

394
00:23:15 --> 00:23:21
And another demonstration is to
make you sort of see in a

395
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
non-kosher way
magnetic domains.

396
00:23:25 --> 00:23:31
But I will tell you why it's
non-kosher.

397
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
I have here an array of eight
by eight magnetic needles,

398
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
compass needles.
And you're going to see them

399
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
there.
And I will change the situation

400
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47
so that you have better light.
And when I have an external

401
00:23:46 --> 00:23:52
magnetic field and I march over
here a little,

402
00:23:50 --> 00:23:56
and I just let it go,
and wait, you will see areas

403
00:23:55 --> 00:24:01
whereby these magnetic needles
point in the same direction and

404
00:24:01 --> 00:24:07
you will see areas where they
point in a different direction.

405
00:24:06 --> 00:24:12
We'll just give it some chance.
And so that may make you think

406
00:24:12 --> 00:24:18
that this is the way that
domains are formed in

407
00:24:16 --> 00:24:22
ferromagnetic material.
Oh, in fact we have now a

408
00:24:20 --> 00:24:26
situation that almost all are
aligned in this direction,

409
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
and there's only a group here
that is pointing in this

410
00:24:29 --> 00:24:35
direction.
I can change that,

411
00:24:30 --> 00:24:36
of course, by changing the
magnetic field.

412
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
Why is this not really a kosher
demonstration to convince you

413
00:24:36 --> 00:24:42
that domains exist?
First of all,

414
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
there is no thermal agitation,
whereas in ferromagnetic

415
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
material there is thermal
agitation.

416
00:24:42 --> 00:24:48
Some may be oriented like this
and others like that,

417
00:24:45 --> 00:24:51
where here you only have two
preferred directions.

418
00:24:48 --> 00:24:54
You don't need quantum
mechanics for that,

419
00:24:50 --> 00:24:56
simply a matter of minimum
energy considerations.

420
00:24:53 --> 00:24:59
And so they either are pointed
like

421
00:24:56 --> 00:25:02
this or they are pointed like
that, and so already that shows

422
00:25:00 --> 00:25:06
you that it's very different
from ferromagnetism.

423
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
But the reason why we show it
to you is it still gives you an

424
00:25:07 --> 00:25:13
interesting idea of the fact
that you can have various

425
00:25:11 --> 00:25:17
orientations and that they come
in groups.

426
00:25:13 --> 00:25:19
That the groups stick together
and are not all in the same

427
00:25:17 --> 00:25:23
direction.
But as I said,

428
00:25:19 --> 00:25:25
it is not really a good way to
explain to you why there are

429
00:25:23 --> 00:25:29
domains in ferromagnetic
material.

430
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
Ah, now you see again,
you have some nicely aligned

431
00:25:30 --> 00:25:36
here and others are in very
different direction here.

432
00:25:35 --> 00:25:41
So the basic idea is there.
It's a nice demonstration,

433
00:25:40 --> 00:25:46
but it shows you something that
really is not related to

434
00:25:45 --> 00:25:51
ferromagnetism.
The demonstration that is one

435
00:25:50 --> 00:25:56
of my favorites,
one of my absolute favorites,

436
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
is one whereby I can make you
listen

437
00:25:58 --> 00:26:04
to the flip-over of these
domains.

438
00:26:03 --> 00:26:09
I have ferromagnetic material
inside a coil.

439
00:26:08 --> 00:26:14
I have here a coil and I'm
going to put ferromagnetic

440
00:26:15 --> 00:26:21
material in here.
And I have here a loudspeaker

441
00:26:21 --> 00:26:27
-- an amplifier as well,
call this an amplifier.

442
00:26:27 --> 00:26:33
And this is a loudspeaker.
Let's first assume there is no

443
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
ferromagnetic material in
there.

444
00:26:38 --> 00:26:44
That's the way I will start the
demonstration.

445
00:26:41 --> 00:26:47
And I approach this with a
magnet, and I go very fast.

446
00:26:45 --> 00:26:51
*Whssht*, what will happen?
Faraday will say,

447
00:26:48 --> 00:26:54
oh, there's a magnetic flux
change, and there will be an EMF

448
00:26:52 --> 00:26:58
in this coil.
That means there will be a

449
00:26:55 --> 00:27:01
current in this coil,
induced current.

450
00:26:57 --> 00:27:03
And it will be amplified and
you will hear some sissing

451
00:27:01 --> 00:27:07
noise.
And you will hear that.

452
00:27:03 --> 00:27:09
If, however,
I come in very slowly,

453
00:27:05 --> 00:27:11
you won't hear anything,
because d phi/dt is then so

454
00:27:10 --> 00:27:16
low, because the time scale of
my motion is so large,

455
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
that you won't hear any
current.

456
00:27:15 --> 00:27:21
The induced current is
insignificantly small.

457
00:27:18 --> 00:27:24
Because remember the induced
current is proportional to the

458
00:27:22 --> 00:27:28
induced EMF, and the induced EMF
is proportional to the time

459
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
change of the magnetic flux.
So I can make that flux change

460
00:27:30 --> 00:27:36
very, very small if I bring it
in very slowly.

461
00:27:33 --> 00:27:39
Now I will put in the
ferromagnetic material,

462
00:27:36 --> 00:27:42
and I will approach it
again very slowly.

463
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
And now, there comes a time
that some of those domains go

464
00:27:43 --> 00:27:49
*cluk*, *cluk*.
But when the domains flip over,

465
00:27:45 --> 00:27:51
there is a magnetic flux change
inside the material,

466
00:27:48 --> 00:27:54
and so the magnetic flux change
means d phi/dt,

467
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
and it's on an extremely short
time scale.

468
00:27:53 --> 00:27:59
And so now you get an EMF,
you get a current going through

469
00:27:57 --> 00:28:03
the wire, and you hear a
cracking noise over the

470
00:28:00 --> 00:28:06
loudspeaker.
And for every group of domains

471
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
that flip, you can hear that.
And that's an amazing thing

472
00:28:05 --> 00:28:11
when you think about it,
that some 10 to the 20

473
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
atoms go
clunk and that you can hear

474
00:28:12 --> 00:28:18
that.
And so this is what we're going

475
00:28:15 --> 00:28:21
to do here, and I will do it
then in, in several steps,

476
00:28:20 --> 00:28:26
so that you first can hear the
noise if I don't have

477
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
ferromagnetic material,
and then -- so here is the,

478
00:28:28 --> 00:28:34
here's the coil.
This is a very small coil.

479
00:28:32 --> 00:28:38
And here is a magnet.
And I'll come very fast towards

480
00:28:36 --> 00:28:42
the coil.
What you heard now is Faraday's

481
00:28:40 --> 00:28:46
Law.
You simply have a magnetic flux

482
00:28:44 --> 00:28:50
change in the coil -- oh,
I shouldn't touch it.

483
00:28:50 --> 00:28:56
Now I come in very slowly,
and go away very slowly.

484
00:28:56 --> 00:29:02
You hear nothing.
d phi/dt is just too low.

485
00:29:01 --> 00:29:07
Now I put in the ferromagnetic
material.

486
00:29:06 --> 00:29:12
Put it inside the coil.
And now I approach it again,

487
00:29:12 --> 00:29:18
very slowly.
There they go.

488
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
You hear them?
Those are, those are domains

489
00:29:21 --> 00:29:27
that go.
I'll come in with the other

490
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
side.
There it goes,

491
00:29:27 --> 00:29:33
the domains.
Isn't that amazing?

492
00:29:30 --> 00:29:36
You hear atoms switch,
groups of atoms.

493
00:29:34 --> 00:29:40
I'll turn it over again.
Now they flip back.

494
00:29:38 --> 00:29:44
They don't like it that that's
their problem.

495
00:29:42 --> 00:29:48
This is called the Barkhausen
effect.

496
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
I find it truly amazing that
you hear groups of atoms,

497
00:29:51 --> 00:29:57
10 to the 20 atoms at the
time, they flip over,

498
00:29:55 --> 00:30:01
and when they do,
there is a magnetic flux change

499
00:29:59 --> 00:30:05
inside the ferromagnetic
material, is sensed by the coil,

500
00:30:03 --> 00:30:09
and you hear a current.
And if I do it fast,

501
00:30:06 --> 00:30:12
uh, these, these,
these, these domains go

502
00:30:09 --> 00:30:15
haywire.
They go nuts now.

503
00:30:11 --> 00:30:17
Imagine that you were a domain
and I would treat you that way.

504
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
You'd go *cluk*,
*cluk*, *cluk*,

505
00:30:18 --> 00:30:24
*cluk*, *cluk*.
But the fact that you can hear

506
00:30:22 --> 00:30:28
it is absolutely amazing,
isn't it.

507
00:30:25 --> 00:30:31
So that's actually a nice way
of demonstrating that these

508
00:30:29 --> 00:30:35
domains exist.
If you did that with

509
00:30:32 --> 00:30:38
faramagnetic- paramagnetic
material, you wouldn't hear

510
00:30:36 --> 00:30:42
that.
So in all cases,

511
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
whether we have diamagnetic
material or paramagnetic

512
00:30:41 --> 00:30:47
material or ferromagnetic
material, uh,

513
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
the magnetic field inside is
different from what the field

514
00:30:48 --> 00:30:54
would
be without the material.

515
00:30:52 --> 00:30:58
And what the field would be
without the material we've

516
00:30:56 --> 00:31:02
called external field.
I've called it vacuum field.

517
00:30:59 --> 00:31:05
And in many cases,
but not all -- next lecture I

518
00:31:03 --> 00:31:09
will discuss the issues of not
all -- in many cases but not all

519
00:31:07 --> 00:31:13
cases, is the field inside the
material proportional to the

520
00:31:12 --> 00:31:18
vacuum field.
And if that is the case,

521
00:31:14 --> 00:31:20
then you can write down that
the field inside is linearly

522
00:31:20 --> 00:31:26
proportional -- so this is the
field inside the material,

523
00:31:24 --> 00:31:30
regardless of whether it's
diamagnetic or paramagnetic or

524
00:31:28 --> 00:31:34
ferromagnetic,
is proportional to the vacuum

525
00:31:31 --> 00:31:37
field.
I will write down vacuum for

526
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
this.
And this proportionality

527
00:31:35 --> 00:31:41
constant I call kappa of M.
I -- our book calls it K of M.

528
00:31:39 --> 00:31:45
And it's called the relative
permeability.

529
00:31:42 --> 00:31:48
And so now we can look at these
values for the relative

530
00:31:46 --> 00:31:52
permeability and we can
immediately understand now the

531
00:31:50 --> 00:31:56
difference between
diamagnetic material,

532
00:31:54 --> 00:32:00
paramagnetic material,
and ferromagnetic material.

533
00:31:59 --> 00:32:05
Since in the case of
diamagnetic material and

534
00:32:03 --> 00:32:09
paramagnetic material,
the B field inside is only

535
00:32:08 --> 00:32:14
slightly different from the
vacuum field,

536
00:32:12 --> 00:32:18
it is common to express kappa
of M in terms of 1 +

537
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23
something which we call the
magnetic susceptibility,

538
00:32:23 --> 00:32:29
which is chi of M.
Because if it is very close to

539
00:32:27 --> 00:32:33
one, then it is easier to simply
list chi of M.

540
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
And let's look at diamagnetic
material.

541
00:32:32 --> 00:32:38
Notice that these values for chi
of M are all negative -- of

542
00:32:36 --> 00:32:42
course, they have to be
negative, otherwise it wouldn't

543
00:32:40 --> 00:32:46
be diamagnetic.
It means that the field inside

544
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
is slightly, a hair smaller than
the vacuum field,

545
00:32:47 --> 00:32:53
because these induced dipoles
oppose the external field,

546
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
remember.
It has nothing to do with

547
00:32:53 --> 00:32:59
Lenz's Law,
but they oppose it

548
00:32:56 --> 00:33:02
nevertheless.
And so you express it in terms

549
00:32:59 --> 00:33:05
of the, um, magnetic
susceptibility,

550
00:33:02 --> 00:33:08
and so you have to take 1 - 1.7 times 10

551
00:33:06 --> 00:33:12
to the -4 to get kappa
of M, which is very close to

552
00:33:10 --> 00:33:16
one.
If now you go to paramagnetic

553
00:33:13 --> 00:33:19
materials, the minus signs
become plus.

554
00:33:15 --> 00:33:21
Again, the numbers are small.
But the fact that it is plus

555
00:33:20 --> 00:33:26
means that inside paramagnetic
material, the magnetic field is

556
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
a little, a
hair larger than the vacuum

557
00:33:28 --> 00:33:34
field.
But now if you go to

558
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36
ferromagnetic material,
it is really absurd to ever

559
00:33:33 --> 00:33:39
list the value for chi of M,
because chi of M is so large

560
00:33:37 --> 00:33:43
that you can forget about the
one, and so chi of M is about the

561
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
same as kappa of M.
And so you deal there with

562
00:33:44 --> 00:33:50
numbers that are 100,
1000, 10000,

563
00:33:47 --> 00:33:53
and even larger than 10000.

564
00:33:49 --> 00:33:55
That means that if kappa of M
is 10000,

565
00:33:52 --> 00:33:58
you would have a field inside
ferromagnetic material that is

566
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
10000 times larger than
your vacuum field.

567
00:34:01 --> 00:34:07
Next lecture I will tell you
that there is a limit to as far

568
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
as you can go,
but for now we will,

569
00:34:09 --> 00:34:15
we will leave it with this.
So paramagnetic and

570
00:34:12 --> 00:34:18
ferromagnetic properties depend
on the temperature.

571
00:34:16 --> 00:34:22
Diamagnetic properties do not
depend on the temperature.

572
00:34:21 --> 00:34:27
So at very low temperatures,
there is very little thermal

573
00:34:25 --> 00:34:31
agitation, and so you can then
easier align

574
00:34:30 --> 00:34:36
these dipoles,
and so the values for kappa of

575
00:34:33 --> 00:34:39
M will then be different.
For ferromagnetic material,

576
00:34:38 --> 00:34:44
if you cool it,
you expect the kappa of M going

577
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
up, so you got a stronger field
inside.

578
00:34:44 --> 00:34:50
So it's temperature-dependent.
If you make the material very

579
00:34:49 --> 00:34:55
hot, then it can lose completely
its ferromagnetic properties.

580
00:34:54 --> 00:35:00
What happens at a certain
temperature, that these dosmain-

581
00:34:59 --> 00:35:05
domains fall
apart, so the domains

582
00:35:02 --> 00:35:08
themselves no longer exist.
They annihilate.

583
00:35:05 --> 00:35:11
And that happens at a very
precise temperature.

584
00:35:07 --> 00:35:13
It's very strange.
That's also something that is

585
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
very difficult to understand,
and you need quantum mechanics

586
00:35:14 --> 00:35:20
for that too.
But at a certain temperature,

587
00:35:17 --> 00:35:23
which we call the Curie
temperature, which for iron is 

588
00:35:20 --> 00:35:26
1043 degrees
Kelvin, which is

589
00:35:23 --> 00:35:29
degrees centigrade,
all of a sudden the domains

590
00:35:27 --> 00:35:33
disappear and the material
becomes paramagnetic.

591
00:35:30 --> 00:35:36
In other words,
if ferromagnetic material would

592
00:35:34 --> 00:35:40
be hanging on a magnet and you
would heat it up above the Curie

593
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
point, it would fall off.
It would become paramagnetic,

594
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
but paramagnetic material in
general doesn't hang on a

595
00:35:48 --> 00:35:54
magnet, because the forces
involved are quite small.

596
00:35:52 --> 00:35:58
And the change is very abrupt,
and I am going to show that to

597
00:35:56 --> 00:36:02
you with a demonstration.
I have a ferromagnetic nut.

598
00:36:01 --> 00:36:07
It's right there.
You will see it very shortly.

599
00:36:04 --> 00:36:10
And this nut,
or washer, hanging on a steel

600
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
cable, and there is here a
magnet.

601
00:36:11 --> 00:36:17
I don't know whether this is
north or south.

602
00:36:14 --> 00:36:20
It doesn't matter.
And here we have a thermal

603
00:36:17 --> 00:36:23
shield.
And so this washer is against

604
00:36:20 --> 00:36:26
the thermal shield,
because it's being attracted.

605
00:36:23 --> 00:36:29
It wants to go towards the
strong magnetic field.

606
00:36:26 --> 00:36:32
It's ferromagnetic.
So it will be sitting here.

607
00:36:30 --> 00:36:36
And now I'm going to heat this
up above the Curie point,

608
00:36:34 --> 00:36:40
770 degrees
centigrade, and you will

609
00:36:39 --> 00:36:45
see it fall off.
And when it cools again,

610
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
it goes back on again.
So I can make you see

611
00:36:48 --> 00:36:54
ferromagnetic properties
disappear.

612
00:36:52 --> 00:36:58
And let me make sure I have the
proper settings.

613
00:36:57 --> 00:37:03
I see nothing.
I see nothing.

614
00:37:00 --> 00:37:06
But there it is.
So here is this nut,

615
00:37:04 --> 00:37:10
and here is this shield,
and the magnet is behind it,

616
00:37:12 --> 00:37:18
you can't see it,
but it's right there.

617
00:37:15 --> 00:37:21
And so it goes against it,
right, it goes just towards the

618
00:37:21 --> 00:37:27
magnetic poles.
It goes into the strong

619
00:37:24 --> 00:37:30
magnetic field.
The magnetic field is

620
00:37:28 --> 00:37:34
non-uniform outside a magnet,
and it goes towards it.

621
00:37:33 --> 00:37:39
And so now I'm going to heat
it.

622
00:37:36 --> 00:37:42
It will take a while,
because, um,

623
00:37:39 --> 00:37:45
770 degrees
centigrade is not

624
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
so easy to achieve.
The three most common

625
00:37:50 --> 00:37:56
ferromagnetic materials are
cobalt, nickel,

626
00:37:56 --> 00:38:02
and iron.
Nickel has a Curie point of

627
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
only
degrees centigrade,

628
00:38:08 --> 00:38:14
so if this were nickel -- ooh.
If this were nickel -- uh-uh.

629
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
[laughter].
Oh, you like that,

630
00:38:21 --> 00:38:27
huh.
I think I need strong hands.

631
00:38:24 --> 00:38:30
A strong hand is coming.
OK.

632
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
I think I fixed it.
I'm a big boy,

633
00:38:30 --> 00:38:36
I did it myself today.
I lost my pen,

634
00:38:33 --> 00:38:39
but that's a detail.
OK, let's try again.

635
00:38:37 --> 00:38:43
So I'm going to heat it up,
and I was mentioning that,

636
00:38:42 --> 00:38:48
um, nickel has a Curie point of
358

637
00:38:49 --> 00:38:55
degrees centigrade.
So that's quite low.

638
00:38:52 --> 00:38:58
This is 770.
Cobalt is 

639
00:38:57 --> 00:39:03
degrees Kelvin Curie point.
Gadolinium is a very special

640
00:39:01 --> 00:39:07
material.
Gadolinium is ferromagnetic in

641
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
the winter, when the temperature
is below 16 degrees

642
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
centigrade, but it is
paramagnetic in the summer,

643
00:39:13 --> 00:39:19
when the temperature is above
16 degrees centigrade.

644
00:39:17 --> 00:39:23
It's beginning to be red-hot
now.

645
00:39:21 --> 00:39:27
770 degrees
centigrade, you expect some

646
00:39:26 --> 00:39:32
visible light in the form of red
light -- there it goes.

647
00:39:30 --> 00:39:36
And I will keep it heating,
I will keep the torch on it,

648
00:39:35 --> 00:39:41
so that you can see that indeed
it's no longer attracted by the

649
00:39:40 --> 00:39:46
magnet.
And the moment that I stop

650
00:39:42 --> 00:39:48
heating it, it will very quickly
cool.

651
00:39:45 --> 00:39:51
It will become ferromagnetic
again, and it will go back.

652
00:39:51 --> 00:39:57
Just watch it.
There it goes.

653
00:39:55 --> 00:40:01
So now it's again
ferromagnetic.

654
00:39:59 --> 00:40:05
So the transition is extremely
sharp.

655
00:40:04 --> 00:40:10
All right.
Uh, OK.

656
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
So paramagnetic materials,
as I mentioned several times,

657
00:40:14 --> 00:40:20
in general cannot hang on a
magnet.

658
00:40:19 --> 00:40:25
The attractive force is --
there's not enough.

659
00:40:25 --> 00:40:31
To hang on a magnet,
the force has to be larger than

660
00:40:29 --> 00:40:35
its own weight.
And diamagn- diamagnetic

661
00:40:32 --> 00:40:38
materials is of course
completely out because

662
00:40:35 --> 00:40:41
diamagnetic materials are always
pushed towards the weak part of

663
00:40:39 --> 00:40:45
the field.
It's only paramagnetic

664
00:40:41 --> 00:40:47
materials and ferromagnetic
materials that experience a

665
00:40:45 --> 00:40:51
force towards the strong part of
the field if the field itself is

666
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
non-uniform.
Now there is one very

667
00:40:52 --> 00:40:58
interesting exception.
And I want to draw your

668
00:40:57 --> 00:41:03
attention to this,
um, transparency here.

669
00:41:01 --> 00:41:07
Look here at oxygen at one
atmosphere.

670
00:41:04 --> 00:41:10
Oxygen at one atmosphere and
300 degrees Kelvin has

671
00:41:09 --> 00:41:15
a value for chi of M which is 2 times 10 to the -6.

672
00:41:14 --> 00:41:20
But now look at liquid oxygen
at 90 degrees Kelvin.

673
00:41:19 --> 00:41:25
That value is 
times larger than this value.

674
00:41:26 --> 00:41:32
Why is that so much higher?
Well, liquid,

675
00:41:29 --> 00:41:35
in general, is about thousand
times denser than gas at one

676
00:41:33 --> 00:41:39
atmosphere.
So you have thousand times more

677
00:41:36 --> 00:41:42
dipoles per cubic meter that in
principle can align.

678
00:41:40 --> 00:41:46
And so clearly you expect an
immediate one-to-one

679
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
correspondence between the
density, how many dipoles you

680
00:41:48 --> 00:41:54
have per cubic meter,
and the value for kappa M --

681
00:41:51 --> 00:41:57
for chi of M.
And so you see indeed that this

682
00:41:56 --> 00:42:02
value is substantially larger.
The reason why it is more than

683
00:42:00 --> 00:42:06
a factor of thousand higher is
that the temperature is also

684
00:42:04 --> 00:42:10
lower.
You go from

685
00:42:06 --> 00:42:12
degrees to 90 degrees,
and that gives you another

686
00:42:09 --> 00:42:15
factor of two,
because when the temperature is

687
00:42:12 --> 00:42:18
lower, there is less thermal
agitation, and so the external

688
00:42:16 --> 00:42:22
field can align the dipoles more
easily.

689
00:42:18 --> 00:42:24
And so that's why you end up
with a factor of 

690
00:42:22 --> 00:42:28
1800.
Even though this value for chi

691
00:42:24 --> 00:42:30
of M is extraordinarily high for
a

692
00:42:28 --> 00:42:34
paramagnetic material,
notice that the field inside

693
00:42:32 --> 00:42:38
would only be 0.35% higher than the vacuum

694
00:42:36 --> 00:42:42
field, because if chi of M is
3.5 times 10 to

695
00:42:41 --> 00:42:47
the -3,
that means that the field

696
00:42:44 --> 00:42:50
inside is only 0.35% higher than the vacuum

697
00:42:49 --> 00:42:55
field.
But that is enough for liquid

698
00:42:52 --> 00:42:58
oxygen to be attracted by a very
strong magnet,

699
00:42:55 --> 00:43:01
provided that it also has a
very non-uniform field outside

700
00:43:01 --> 00:43:07
the magnet.
And so the force with which

701
00:43:05 --> 00:43:11
liquid oxygen is pulled towards
a magnet can be made larger than

702
00:43:10 --> 00:43:16
the weight of the liquid oxygen.
And so I can make you see today

703
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
that I can have liquid oxygen
hanging from a magnet.

704
00:43:21 --> 00:43:27
And that's what we are going to
do here.

705
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
Make sure I have the right
setting.

706
00:43:29 --> 00:43:35
Ah, this is it.
Now we're going to have some

707
00:43:33 --> 00:43:39
changes in the lights.
So there you see the two

708
00:43:38 --> 00:43:44
magnetic poles.
It's a electromagnet.

709
00:43:41 --> 00:43:47
And so we can turn the magnetic
field on at will.

710
00:43:46 --> 00:43:52
So here are the poles of the
magnet.

711
00:43:49 --> 00:43:55
And the first thing I will do
is very boring.

712
00:43:53 --> 00:43:59
I will throw some,
uh, liquid nitrogen between the

713
00:43:58 --> 00:44:04
poles.
Now I don't have the value for

714
00:44:02 --> 00:44:08
liquid nitrogen there,
but nitrogen is diamagnetic,

715
00:44:05 --> 00:44:11
so it's not even an issue.
Diamagnetic material is pushed

716
00:44:09 --> 00:44:15
away from the strong field.
So even though the value for chi

717
00:44:12 --> 00:44:18
of M will be very different for
liquid nitrogen than it is for

718
00:44:16 --> 00:44:22
gaseous nitrogen,
it doesn't matter.

719
00:44:18 --> 00:44:24
So certainly it will be pushed
out.

720
00:44:20 --> 00:44:26
So that's the first thing I
want to do, just to bore you a

721
00:44:24 --> 00:44:30
little bit.
Because I have to keep you on

722
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
the edge of your seat before
you're going to see this oxygen,

723
00:44:31 --> 00:44:37
which will be hanging in there.
So let's first power this

724
00:44:38 --> 00:44:44
magnet -- I hope I did that --
yes, I think I did.

725
00:44:43 --> 00:44:49
And here comes the liquid
nitrogen.

726
00:44:47 --> 00:44:53
Boring like hell,
just falls through.

727
00:44:51 --> 00:44:57
Now comes the oxygen.
Liquid oxygen.

728
00:44:55 --> 00:45:01
It's hanging in there.
I challenge you,

729
00:44:59 --> 00:45:05
you've never in your life seen
liquid hanging on a magnet.

730
00:45:06 --> 00:45:12
You can tell your parents about
it -- and of course your

731
00:45:10 --> 00:45:16
grandchildren.
It's hanging there.

732
00:45:13 --> 00:45:19
I'll put some more in -- make
sure I have the right stuff,

733
00:45:17 --> 00:45:23
yeah.
Put some more in.

734
00:45:19 --> 00:45:25
There is liquid oxygen.
When I break the current,

735
00:45:22 --> 00:45:28
it's no longer a magnet,
it will fall of course.

736
00:45:26 --> 00:45:32
Don't worry,
you'll get more.

737
00:45:28 --> 00:45:34
Who has ever in his life seen a
liquid hang on a magnet?

738
00:45:33 --> 00:45:39
It's paramagnetic,
it's not ferromagnetic,

739
00:45:37 --> 00:45:43
but because the density is so
high and because it's so cold,

740
00:45:41 --> 00:45:47
the value for chi of M is high
enough that the force on it is

741
00:45:46 --> 00:45:52
larger than its own weight.
If you do this with aluminum,

742
00:45:50 --> 00:45:56
not a chance in the world.
Aluminum will not hang in

743
00:45:54 --> 00:46:00
there, even though aluminum,
as you can see there,

744
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
is paramagnetic.
But the value 2 times 10 to

745
00:46:01 --> 00:46:07
the -5 is way too small,
and it will not stick to a

746
00:46:05 --> 00:46:11
magnet.
OK.

747
00:46:07 --> 00:46:13
You have something to think
about.

748
00:46:09 --> 00:46:15
I will see you Friday.
