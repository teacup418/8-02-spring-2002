00:00:00 --> 00:00:03,533



2
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:07,953
Today I want to talk with you
about Doppler effect,

3
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:12,728
and I will start with the
Doppler effect of sound which

4
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:17,856
many of you perhaps remember
from your high school physics.

5
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:22,454
If a source of sound moves
towards you or if you move

6
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:27,14
towards a source of sound,
you hear an increase in the

7
00:00:27,14 --> 00:00:30,324
pitch.
And if you move away from each

8
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:34,745
other you hear a decrease of a
pitch.

9
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:40,703
Let this be the transmitter of
sounds and this is the receiver

10
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:44,22
of sound, it could be you,
your ears.

11
00:00:44,22 --> 00:00:49,495
And suppose this is the
velocity of the transmitter and

12
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:53,012
this is the velocity of the
receiver.

13
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:58,58
And V should be larger than
zero if the velocity is in the

14
00:00:58,58 --> 00:01:01,999
direction.
And in the equations what

15
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:08,153
follow, smaller than zero it is
in this direction.

16
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:12,386
The frequency that the receiver
will experience,

17
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:17,34
will hear if you like that
word, that frequency I call F

18
00:01:17,34 --> 00:01:20,672
prime.
And F is the frequency as it is

19
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:26,256
transmitted by the transmitter.
And that F prime is F times the

20
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:31,66
speed of sound minus V receiver
divided by the speed of sound

21
00:01:31,66 --> 00:01:36,884
minus V of the transmitter.
So this is known as the Doppler

22
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:41,569
shift equation.
If you have Volume one of

23
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,117
Giancoli you can look it up
there as well.

24
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:47,973
Suppose you are not moving at
all.

25
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:51,781
You are sitting still.
So V receiver is zero.

26
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:55,935
But I move towards you with one
meter per second.

27
00:01:55,935 --> 00:02:00,781
If I move towards you then F
prime will be larger than F.

28
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:05,541
If I move away from you with
one meter per second then F

29
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:11,576
prime will be smaller than F.
The speed of sound is three

30
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:16,887
hundred forty meters per second.
So if F which is the frequency

31
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,485
that I will produce is four
thousand hertz,

32
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:24,512
then if I move to you with one
meter per second,

33
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:29,309
which I'm going to try to do,
then the frequency that you

34
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:33,679
will experience is about four
thousand twelve hertz.

35
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,506
It's up by oh point three
percent.

36
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:41,732
Which is that ratio one divided
by three forty.

37
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:45,605
And if I move away from you
with one meter per second,

38
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:49,844
then the frequency that you
will hear is about twelve hertz

39
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:52,183
lower.
So you hear a lower pitch.

40
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,668
About oh point three percent
lower.

41
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:58,615
I have here a tuning fork.
Tuning fork is four thousand

42
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,173
hertz.
I will bang it and I will try

43
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:05,266
to move my hand towards you one
meter per second roughly.

44
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:08,044
That's what I calculated it
roughly is.

45
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:10,529
Move it away from you,
towards you,

46
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:13,526
away from you,
as long

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,916
as the sound lasts.
You will hear the pitch change

48
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:22,843
from four thousand twelve to
three thousand nine hundred

49
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:25,352
eight-eight.
Very noticeable.

50
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:29,205
Have you heard it?
Who has heard clearly the

51
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,982
Doppler shift,
raise your hands,

52
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:32,878
please?
OK.

53
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,014
Chee chee chee chee it's very
clear.

54
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:41,389
Increased fre- frequency and
then when I move my hands away a

55
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,817
lower
pitch.

56
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:48,308
Now you may think that it makes
no difference whether I move

57
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:51,504
towards you or whether you move
towards me.

58
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:56,071
And that is indeed true if the
speeds are very small compared

59
00:03:56,071 --> 00:04:00,104
to the speed of sound.
But it is not true anymore when

60
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:03,529
we approach the speed of sound.
As an example,

61
00:04:03,529 --> 00:04:07,182
if you move away from me with
the speed of sound,

62
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:11,064
you will never hear me.
Because the sound will never

63
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:14,184
catch up with you,
and so F prime is zero.

64
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:18,772
And you can
indeed confirm that with this

65
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,808
equation.
But if I moved away from you

66
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:26,158
with the speed of sound,
for sure the sound will reach

67
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:29,441
with you.
And the frequency that you will

68
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,97
hear is only half of the one
that I produce.

69
00:04:32,97 --> 00:04:37,649
So there's a huge asymmetry.
Big difference whether I move

70
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,67
or whether you move.
So I now want to turn towards

71
00:04:41,67 --> 00:04:46,184
electromagnetic radiation.
There is also a Doppler shift

72
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:52,354
in electromagnetic radiation.
If you see a traffic light red

73
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:57,391
and you approach it with high
enough speed you will experience

74
00:04:57,391 --> 00:05:02,592
a higher frequency and then you
will see the wavelengths shorter

75
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:06,06
than red and you may even think
it's green.

76
00:05:06,06 --> 00:05:09,528
You may even go through that
traffic light.

77
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:13,904
To calculate the proper
relation between F prime and F

78
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:18,362
requires special relativity.
And so I will give you the

79
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:21,665
final result.
F prime is the one that you

80
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:27,268
receive.
F is the one that is emitted by

81
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:32,642
the transmitter.
And we get here then one minus

82
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:38,6
beta divided by one plus beta to
the power one-half.

83
00:05:38,6 --> 00:05:44,207
And beta is V over C,
C being the speed of light,

84
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:50,633
and V being the s- speed,
the relative speed between the

85
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:56,741
transmitter and you.
If beta is larger than zero you

86
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:00,52
are receding from each other in
this equation.

87
00:06:00,52 --> 00:06:05,474
If beta is smaller than zero
you are approaching each other.

88
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:10,261
You may wonder why we don't
make a distinction now between

89
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:14,039
the transmitter on the one hand,
the velocity,

90
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,895
and the receiver on the other
hand.

91
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:20,841
There's only one beta.
Well, that is typical for

92
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:24,788
special relativity.
What counts is only relative

93
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:28,691
motion.
There is no such thing as

94
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:32,083
absolute motion.
The question are you moving

95
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:36,815
relative to me or I relative to
you is an illegal question in

96
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:40,522
special relativity.
What counts is only relative

97
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:43,519
motion.
If we are in vacuum then lambda

98
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,251
equals C divided by F and so
lambda prime equals C divided by

99
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:50,696
F prime.
Lambda prime is now the

100
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:55,428
wavelength that you receive and
lambda is the wavelength that

101
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:59,706
was emitted by the --
by the source.

102
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:05,336
So I can substitute in here,
in this F, C divided by lambda

103
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:10,966
which is more commonly done.
So this Doppler shift equation

104
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:16,888
for electromagnetic radiation is
more common given in terms of

105
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:19,994
lambda.
But of course the two are

106
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:23,78
identical.
And then you get now one plus

107
00:07:23,78 --> 00:07:28,731
beta upstairs divided by one
minus beta to the power

108
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:33,488
one-half.
The velocity there if I'm

109
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:38,646
completely honest with you is
the radial velocity.

110
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:44,963
If you are here and here is the
source of emission and if the

111
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:50,227
relative velocity between the
two of you were this,

112
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:55,07
then it is this component,
this angle is theta,

113
00:07:55,07 --> 00:07:59,071
this component which is V
cosine theta,

114
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:03,809
which we call the radial
velocity,

115
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:08,561
that is really the velocity
which is in that equation.

116
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:12,237
Police cars measure your speed
with radar.

117
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:17,796
They reflect the radar off your
car and they measure the change

118
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:21,203
in frequency as the radar is
reflected.

119
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:26,404
That gives a Doppler shift
because of your speed and that's

120
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:31,605
the way they determine the speed
of your car to a very high

121
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:35,371
degree of accuracy.
You can imagine that in

122
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:40,199
astronomy
Doppler shift plays a key role.

123
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:44,688
Because we can measure the
radial velocities of stars

124
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:48,142
relative to us.
Most stellar spectra show

125
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:51,681
discrete frequencies,
discrete wavelength,

126
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:56,603
which result from atoms and
molecules in the atmosphere of

127
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:00,056
the stars.
Last lecture I showed you with

128
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:05,322
your own gradings a neon light
source and I convinced you that

129
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:10,393
there were discrete
frequencies and discrete

130
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:15,576
wavelengths emitted by the neon.
If a particular discrete

131
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:19,834
wavelength, for instance in our
own laboratory,

132
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:24,739
would be five thousand
Angstrom, and look at the star,

133
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:29,922
and I see that that wavelength
is longer, lambda prime is

134
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:34,55
larger than lambda,
then I conclude -- lambda prime

135
00:09:34,55 --> 00:09:39,271
is larger than lambda,
that means the wavelength the

136
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:45,285
way I observe it is shifted
towards longer wavelength,

137
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:50,322
is shifted in the direction of
the red, and we call that red

138
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:53,311
shift.
It means that we are receding

139
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:56,982
from each other.
If however I measure lambda

140
00:09:56,982 --> 00:10:02,104
prime to be smaller than lambda,
so lambda prime smaller than

141
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:05,861
lambda, we call that blue shift
in astronomy,

142
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:09,874
and it means that we are
approaching each other.

143
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:17,191
And so we make reference to the
direction in the spectrum where

144
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:22,125
the lines are moving.
I can give you a simple

145
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:26,386
example.
I looked up for the star Delta

146
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:33,225
Leporis what the red shift is.
There is a line that most stars

147
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:38,383
show in their spectrum which is
due to calcium,

148
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:45,223
it even has a particular name,
I think it's called the calcium

149
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:48,891
K
line, but that's not so

150
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:53,794
important, the name.
In our own laboratory lambda is

151
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:58,985
known to a high degree of
accuracy, is three nine three

152
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:02,253
three point six six four
Angstroms.

153
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:07,636
We look at the star and we
recognize without a doubt that

154
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:13,116
that's due to calcium in the
atmosphere of the star and we

155
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:19,076
find that lambda prime is one
point two nine eight

156
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:24,094
Angstroms higher than lambda.
So lambda prime is larger than

157
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:27,326
lambda.
So there is red shift and so we

158
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:31,664
are receding from each other.
I go to that equation.

159
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:36,768
I substitute lambda prime and
lambda in there and I find that

160
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:41,531
beta equals plus three point
three times ten to the minus

161
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:43,998
four.
The plus for beta indeed

162
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:49,016
confirms that we are receding,
that our relative velocity is

163
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:54,201
away from each other,
and I find therefore that the

164
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:58,593
radial velocity -- I stress it
is the radial component of our

165
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,472
velocity is then beta times C
and that turns out to be

166
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,912
approximately ninety-nine
kilometers per second.

167
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:09,132
So I have measured now the
relative velocity,

168
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,06
radial velocity,
between the star and me,

169
00:12:12,06 --> 00:12:16,451
and the question whether the
star is moving away from me or I

170
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:20,038
move away from the star is an
irrelevant question,

171
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:24,722
this is always a relative
velocity that matters.

172
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:28,703
How can I measure the
wavelength shifts so accurately

173
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:33,448
that we can see the difference
of one point three Angstroms out

174
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:37,046
of four thousand?
The way that it's done is that

175
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:41,562
you observe the starlight and
you make a spectrum and at the

176
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:46,384
same time you make a spectrum of
light sources in the laboratory

177
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,905
with well-known and
well-calibrated wavelength.

178
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:55,34
Suppose there were some neon in
the atmosphere of a star.

179
00:12:55,34 --> 00:12:59,509
Then you could compare the neon
light the way we looked at it

180
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,428
last lecture.
You could compare it with the

181
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:06,737
wavelength that you see from the
star and you can see very very

182
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:08,961
small shifts.
You make a relative

183
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:11,88
measurement.
So you need spectrometers with

184
00:13:11,88 --> 00:13:16,05
very high spectral resolution.
So there was a big industry in

185
00:13:16,05 --> 00:13:19,663
the early twentieth century to
measure these relative

186
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:23,208
velocities of stars.
And their speeds were typically

187
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,961
a hundred, two hundred
kilometers per

188
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,775
second.
Not unlike the star that I just

189
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,477
calculated for you.
Some of those stars relative to

190
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:37,18
us are approaching.
Other stars are receding in our

191
00:13:37,18 --> 00:13:39,55
galaxy.
But it was Slipher in the

192
00:13:39,55 --> 00:13:43,919
nineteen twenties who observed
the red shift of some nebulae

193
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,436
which were believed at the time
to be in our own galaxy and he

194
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:52,583
found that they were -- had a
very high velocity of up to

195
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:58,063
fifteen hundred kilometers per
second, and they were always

196
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:01,531
moving away from us.
And it was found shortly after

197
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:05,9
that that these nebulae were not
in our own galaxy but that they

198
00:14:05,9 --> 00:14:08,12
were galaxies in their own
right.

199
00:14:08,12 --> 00:14:11,934
So they were collections of
about ten billion stars just

200
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,471
like our own galaxy.
And so when you take a spectrum

201
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,523
of those galaxies,
then of course you get the

202
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:22,823
average of millions and millions
of stars, but that still would

203
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:26,776
allow you then to calculate the
red shift, the average red

204
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:31,577
shift, of the galaxy,
and therefore uh its velocity.

205
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:35,043
And Hubble, the famous
astronomer after which the

206
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:39,014
Hubble space telescope is named,
and Humason made a very

207
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:42,984
courageous attempt to measure
also the distance to these

208
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:45,439
galaxies.
They knew the velocities.

209
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:48,76
That was easy because they knew
the red shifts.

210
00:14:48,76 --> 00:14:52,948
The distance determinations in
astronomy is a can of worms.

211
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:56,557
And I will spare you the
details about the distance

212
00:14:56,557 --> 00:15:00,961
determinations.
But Hubble made a spectacular

213
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:04,242
discovery.
He found a linear relation

214
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:07,705
between the velocity and the
distances.

215
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:10,621
And we know this as Hubble's
law.

216
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:15,998
And Hubble's law is that the
velocity is a constant which is

217
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,825
now named after Hubble,
capital H, times D.

218
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:24,564
And the modern value for H,
the modern value for H is

219
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:30,214
seventy-two kilometers per
second per megaparsec.

220
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:35,627
What is a megaparsec?
A megaparsec is a distance.

221
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:42,055
In astronomy we don't deal with
inches, we don't deal with

222
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:49,272
kilometers, that is just not big
enough, we deal with parsecs and

223
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:53,67
megaparsecs.
And one megaparsec is three

224
00:15:53,67 --> 00:15:58,858
point two six times ten to the
six light-years.

225
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:04,046
And if you want that in
kilometers,

226
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:11,748
it's not unreasonable question,
it's about three point one

227
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:16,613
times ten to the nineteen
kilometers.

228
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:24,18
So I could calculate for a
specific galaxy that I have in

229
00:16:24,18 --> 00:16:31,072
mind, I can calculate the
distance if I know the red

230
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:35,802
shift.
I have a particular galaxy in

231
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:44,034
mind for which lambda prime --
for which lambda prime is one

232
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:47,746
point zero zero three three
times lambda.

233
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:52,571
So notice again that the
wavelength that I receive is

234
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:57,211
indeed longer than lambda,
so there is a red shift.

235
00:16:57,211 --> 00:17:01,944
I go to my Doppler shift
equation which is this one.

236
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:06,306
I calculate beta.
One equation with one unknown,

237
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:10,76
can solve for beta.
And I find now that V is five

238
00:17:10,76 --> 00:17:16,739
thousand kilometers per second.
Very straightforward,

239
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:20,001
nothing special,
very easy calculation.

240
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:24,379
But now with Hubble's law I can
calculate what D is.

241
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:28,757
Because D now is the velocity
which is five thousand

242
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:34,079
kilometers per second divided by
that seventy-two and that then

243
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,341
is approximately sixty-nine
megaparsec.

244
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:42,062
Again we have the distance if
we do it in these units in

245
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:46,27
megaparsecs.
That's about two hundred and

246
00:17:46,27 --> 00:17:50,648
twenty-five million light-years.
And so the object is about two

247
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:54,602
hundred and twenty-five million
light-years away from us.

248
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:58,486
So it took the light two
hundred and twenty-five million

249
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:01,945
years to reach us.
So when you see light from this

250
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:04,346
object you're looking back in
time.

251
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:08,441
And if you have a galaxy which
is twice as far away as this

252
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:11,618
one, then the velocity would be
twice as high.

253
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:16,745
And they're always receding
relative to us.

254
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:24,411
I'd like to show you now some
spectra of three galaxies.

255
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:28,872
Can I have the first slide,
John?

256
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:36,12
All right, you see here a
galaxy and here you see the

257
00:18:36,12 --> 00:18:43,786
spectrum of that galaxy.
That may not be very impressive

258
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,734
to
you.

259
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:49,527
The lines that are being
recognized to be due to calcium

260
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:52,56
K and calcium eight are these
two dark lines.

261
00:18:52,56 --> 00:18:55,594
Some of you may not even be
able to see them.

262
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:59,593
And this is the comparison
spectra taken in the laboratory.

263
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:03,386
These lines are seen as dark
lines, not as bright lines.

264
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:06,971
We call them absorption lines.
They are formed in the

265
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:10,626
atmosphere of the star.
Why they show up as dark lines

266
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:13,659
and not as bright lines is not
important now.

267
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:17,452
I don't want to go into that.
That's too much astronomy.

268
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:21,19
But
they are lines and that's what

269
00:19:21,19 --> 00:19:23,629
counts.
And these lines are shifted

270
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,861
towards the red part of the
spectrum by a teeny weeny little

271
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:30,372
bit.
You see here this little arrow.

272
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:34,605
And the conclusion then is that
in this case the velocity of

273
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:38,909
that galaxy is t- seven hundred
twenty miles per second which

274
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:43,07
translates into eleven hundred
fifty kilometers per second,

275
00:19:43,07 --> 00:19:47,446
and so that brings this object
if you believe the modern value

276
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:52,038
for Hubble constant at about
sixteen megaparsec.

277
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,056
This galaxy is substantially
farther away.

278
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:59,178
No surprise that it therefore
also looks smaller in size,

279
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:02,344
and notice that here the lines
have shifted.

280
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:05,73
These lines have shifted
substantially further.

281
00:20:05,73 --> 00:20:10,073
And if I did my homework using
the velocity that they claim,

282
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:14,269
which they can do with high
degree of accuracy because you

283
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:17,508
can calculate lambda prime
divided by lambda,

284
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:22,441
those measurements can be made
with enorm- accuracy,

285
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:26,038
I find that this object is
about three hundred five

286
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:29,852
megaparsecs away from us,
so that's about twenty times

287
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:33,881
further away than this object.
So the speed is also about

288
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:37,694
twenty times higher of course
because there's a linear

289
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,572
relationship.
And if you look at this one

290
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,53
which is even further away,
then notice that these lines

291
00:20:44,53 --> 00:20:48,415
have shifted even more.
The next slide shows you what I

292
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:52,229
would call Hubble diagram.
It was kindly sent to me by

293
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:55,85
Wendy
Freedman and her coworkers.

294
00:20:55,85 --> 00:21:00,077
Wendy is the leader of a large
team of scientists who are

295
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:03,926
making observations with the
Hubble space telescope.

296
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:08,38
You see here distance and you
see here velocity in the units

297
00:21:08,38 --> 00:21:11,701
that we used in class,
kilometers per second.

298
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:14,796
Forget this part.
That's not so important.

299
00:21:14,796 --> 00:21:18,268
But you see the incredible
linear relationship.

300
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:22,117
And Wendy concluded that
Hubble's constant is around

301
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:26,345
seventy-two.
It could be a little lower,

302
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:30,8
it could be a little higher.
She goes out all the way to

303
00:21:30,8 --> 00:21:35,58
four hundred megaparsecs with
associated velocities of about

304
00:21:35,58 --> 00:21:38,901
twenty-six thousand kilometers
per second.

305
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:42,709
That's about nine percent of
the speed of light.

306
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:47,407
So beta is about one-tenth.
So for this object lambda prime

307
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:51,134
divided by lambda would be about
one point one.

308
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:54,536
With a ten percent shift in the
wavelength.

309
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:58,424
Hubble, who published his data
in

310
00:21:58,424 --> 00:22:01,027
the twenties,
his whole data set when he

311
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:04,898
concluded that there was a
linear relation had only objects

312
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:09,036
with velocities less than eleven
hundred kilometers per second.

313
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,973
And eleven hundred kilometers
per second is this point here.

314
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:16,511
So Hubble had only points --
there are not even any in

315
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,579
Wendy's diagram,
which are here.

316
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:22,25
And he concluded courageously
that there was this linear

317
00:22:22,25 --> 00:22:24,986
relationship.
And you see it has stood the

318
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:27,656
acid test.
We still believe it is linear.

319
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:33,198
The only difference was that
Hubble's distances were very

320
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:36,29
different from what we believe
today.

321
00:22:36,29 --> 00:22:39,296
They were about seven times
smaller.

322
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:43,934
So Hubble constant was
different for him but the linear

323
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:48,143
relationship was there.
OK, that's enough for this

324
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:50,806
slide.
So now comes a sixty-four

325
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:54,671
dollar question,
why do all galaxies which are

326
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:58,279
far away, why w- do they move
away from us?

327
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:02,383
Well,
I can uh suggest a very simple

328
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:05,603
picture to you.
We are at the center of the

329
00:23:05,603 --> 00:23:09,821
universe and there was a huge
explosion a long time ago.

330
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,041
We refer to that explosion as
the Big Bang.

331
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:17,566
And since we are at the center
where the explosion occurred,

332
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:22,243
the galaxies which obtained the
largest speed in the explosion

333
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:24,773
are now the farthest away from
us.

334
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:28,607
Now assume that this explosion
is the correct idea.

335
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,061
Assume that there was a Big
Bang.

336
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:36,457
Then I can ask the question now
when did it occur?

337
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:41,555
I can now turn the clock back
and I can do the following.

338
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:47,016
I can take two objects which
are a distance D apart today but

339
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:52,023
they were together when the
universe was born at the Big

340
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:55,3
Bang.
And let's assume that they have

341
00:23:55,3 --> 00:24:00,852
been going away from each other
always with the same velocity.

342
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:05,037
Let's assume that now for
simplicity.

343
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:09,419
So if they always went away
with the same velocity from each

344
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,503
other then the distance that
they are now today is their

345
00:24:13,503 --> 00:24:18,181
velocity times the time T which
is then the age of the universe.

346
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:22,488
But we also know with Hubble's
law that the velocity V is H

347
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:24,864
times D.
And we assume that these

348
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,983
velocities are the same now for
simplicity.

349
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:31,77
You multiply these two
equations with each other and

350
00:24:31,77 --> 00:24:35,929
you find immediately that the
age of the

351
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:41,409
universe is one over H.
And that indeed has the unit of

352
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:43,337
time.
If you take H,

353
00:24:43,337 --> 00:24:49,122
the one that we believe in
nowadays, and you calculate one

354
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:55,109
over H, and you work in M K S
units, you'll find that T H is

355
00:24:55,109 --> 00:25:00,894
about fourteen billion years,
I'll first give it to you in

356
00:25:00,894 --> 00:25:07,186
seconds, it's about four point
three times ten to the seventeen

357
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:11,293
seconds.
And that is about fourteen

358
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:14,56
billion years.
So with this picture in mind,

359
00:25:14,56 --> 00:25:18,663
the universe would be about
fourteen billion years old,

360
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:22,083
but because of the
gravitational attraction of

361
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,046
these galaxies,
they attract each other,

362
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:29,453
you may expect that the speed
of the galaxies was larger in

363
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:33,86
the past, and therefore the
speed that we have -- we assume

364
00:25:33,86 --> 00:25:37,735
that the speed doesn't change is
not quite accurate,

365
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:42,209
and so maybe the universe is a
little younger,

366
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,296
maybe twelve billion years or
so.

367
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:47,687
We know from theoretical
calculations that the oldest

368
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:51,273
stars in our own galaxy are
about ten billion years old.

369
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:54,925
Therefore the universe cannot
be younger than ten billion

370
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:57,273
years.
And there is general consensus

371
00:25:57,273 --> 00:26:00,86
in the community that our
universe is probably twelve to

372
00:26:00,86 --> 00:26:04,381
fourteen billion years old.
Now the whole issue of this

373
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:08,294
deceleration that I mentioned as
the galaxies moved away from

374
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:12,142
each other is at the heart of
research in

375
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:15,419
cosmology.
And in fact it is now believed

376
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,433
that very early on in the
universe there was first

377
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:22,465
acceleration followed by
deceleration,

378
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:26,889
and maybe again acceleration.
That is quite mysterious.

379
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:30,33
Frontier research is going on
in this area.

380
00:26:30,33 --> 00:26:34,919
At MIT we have three world
experts, Professors Alan Guth,

381
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,442
w- made major contributions to
this concept,

382
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:42,62
cosmology, we have Ed
Bertschinger and we have Scott

383
00:26:42,62 --> 00:26:47,209
Burles.
If we take Hubble's law at face

384
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:52,338
value, I can calculate how far
the edge of our visible universe

385
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:54,323
is.
Which is the horizon.

386
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:58,377
We call that the horizon.
I can calculate what the

387
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:01,356
maximum distance is that we can
look.

388
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:05,244
D maximum can be found by
making the velocity C.

389
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:10,291
So that the galaxies are moving
-- we are moving away from the

390
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:15,007
galaxies, the galaxies are
moving away from us -- with the

391
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:18,812
speed of light.
And so you would find then that

392
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:22,345
D
max is C divided by H.

393
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:26,246
That is a distance.
And you will find then,

394
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:30,055
no surprise,
if you use the modern number,

395
00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:34,699
that that distance is fourteen
billion light-years.

396
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:40,273
We can never see beyond that.
Because if V equals C then beta

397
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:45,382
becomes one and if beta becomes
one lambda prime becomes

398
00:27:45,382 --> 00:27:50,676
infinitely large,
you have an infinite amount

399
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:54,389
of red shift,
and F prime becomes zero.

400
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:59,078
So the electromagnetic
radiation has no frequency

401
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:04,452
anymore and so there's no energy
anymore in the photons.

402
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:09,825
So that is then the edge of our
universe, of our visible

403
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:13,635
universe.
You can never see beyond that.

404
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:16,957
So now comes a reasonable
question.

405
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:23,21
How far have we been able to
see into the universe?

406
00:28:23,21 --> 00:28:28,147
And to my knowledge the record
holder is a galaxy for which

407
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:32,232
lambda prime over lambda is
seven point five six.

408
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:35,041
Was published only two months
ago.

409
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:39,297
Seven point five six.
Now at such very large values

410
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:43,043
of red shift,
general relativity becomes very

411
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:45,937
important.
And the equation that we

412
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:49,937
derived here was derived for
special relativity.

413
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:54,193
And so with very high values of
red

414
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:58,975
shift like lambda prime over
lambda seven point five six you

415
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:03,838
cannot reliably calculate the
velocities using that equation.

416
00:29:03,838 --> 00:29:08,458
And so you cannot use that
velocity then and shove it into

417
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,781
Hubble's law and find the -- the
distance.

418
00:29:11,781 --> 00:29:16,563
But there is no question that
the -- that object is probably

419
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:21,426
at a distance of something like
thirteen billion light-years.

420
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:27,181
Very very far away from us,
near the edge of our universe.

421
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:32,424
I will show you an object that
is also believed to be near the

422
00:29:32,424 --> 00:29:36,808
edge of the universe.
It comes up in the next slide.

423
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:41,107
The distance is roughly twelve
billion light-years.

424
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:46,093
So for one, when you look at
that object, there it is -- it

425
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:51,079
doesn't look very impressive but
what do you expect from an

426
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,721
object that is twelve billion
light-years away from us?

427
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,987
It's a quasar,
which is a very peculiar

428
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:03,261
galaxy.
It uh emits emission lines,

429
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:08,291
the spectra do not show these
dark lines that I showed you

430
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:12,35
earlier, but they actually have
emission lines,

431
00:30:12,35 --> 00:30:17,821
and the light that you see here
was emitted some twelve billion

432
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:21,44
years ago.
And now comes the spectrum from

433
00:30:21,44 --> 00:30:26,822
this object in the next slide.
This was published last year by

434
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:30,882
Scott Anderson and his
coworkers, University of

435
00:30:30,882 --> 00:30:36,586
Washington in Seattle.
I have collaborated with Scott

436
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:40,631
on many projects.
So here you see the spectrum of

437
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:45,181
that quasar that you just saw.
And here you see a line,

438
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:48,214
an emission line,
at roughly seven --

439
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:53,269
seventy-eight hundred Angstroms.
And there are all reasons to

440
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:58,409
believe that this in the frame
of reference of that quasar was

441
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:02,538
the Lyman alpha line which is
emitted by hydrogen,

442
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:06,666
which is twelve hundred and
sixteen

443
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:10,165
Angstroms.
Now we have here five thousand,

444
00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:12,639
four thousand,
three thousand,

445
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,857
two thousand,
one thousand,

446
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:19,038
so here is roughly where the
wavelength lambda is,

447
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,731
and here is lambda prime.
Lambda prime is six point four

448
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:28,509
one times larger than lambda.
He mentions five point four

449
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:33,799
one, but Z is what astronomers
in general quote is lambda prime

450
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:40,113
divided by lambda minus one,
so the ratio lambda prime over

451
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:44,538
lambda is six point four one.
Absolutely amazing that you can

452
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:49,186
make such accurate measurements,
such incredible beautiful data,

453
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:52,431
and this line is all the way in
the infrared,

454
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:55,898
you cannot see this with your
naked eye anymore,

455
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:59,882
our eyes I think can only see
up to sixty-five hundred.

456
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:04,234
So the twelve sixteen line was
in the UV, shifts all the way

457
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:07,553
into the infrared,
and this allows astronomers

458
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:11,832
then to measure the value lambda
prime over

459
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:16,821
lambda, and there is little
doubt that this object is also

460
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:20,06
near the edge of our visible
universe.

461
00:32:20,06 --> 00:32:22,686
That's enough,
John, thank you.

462
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:27,588
I'd like to return to the Big
Bang, to the explosion some

463
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:30,652
twelve or fifteen billion years
ago.

464
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:35,467
And I'd like to raise the
question, are we at the center

465
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:39,668
of that explosion?
Are we really at the center of

466
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:44,395
our universe?
That cannot be of course.

467
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:48,882
It's an incredible arrogance.
It would be too egocentric.

468
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:52,807
I know that we all think very
highly of ourselves,

469
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:56,813
but this cannot be.
We are nothing in the framework

470
00:32:56,813 --> 00:33:00,818
of the total universe.
We cannot possibly be at the

471
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:03,863
center.
So how do we reconcile this now

472
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:07,948
with what we observe?
Imagine that you were a raisin

473
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:10,832
in a raisin bread.
Quite a promotion,

474
00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:14,678
from a human being to a raisin
in a raisin bread.

475
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:19,686
And I put you in an oven.
And the raisin bread,

476
00:33:19,686 --> 00:33:23,99
the dough is going to expand.
All raisins will see other

477
00:33:23,99 --> 00:33:27,981
raisins move away from each
other and the larger the

478
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:32,129
distance to your raisins the
larger the speed will be.

479
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:36,276
And each raisin will think that
they are very special.

480
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:40,581
Suppose here this is you,
one raisin, and here's another

481
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:43,163
raisin, and here's another
raisin.

482
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:48,798
After a certain amount of time
all distances have doubled.

483
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:51,737
So this one is here.
And this one is here.

484
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:55,824
So you can immediately see that
when you look at this one,

485
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:59,337
that its velocity is
substantially lower than that

486
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,488
one.
This is twice as far away,

487
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:03,926
you will see twice as high a
speed.

488
00:34:03,926 --> 00:34:06,579
But this raisin will look at
this one.

489
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:11,024
And it will also conclude that
this raisin relative to this one

490
00:34:11,024 --> 00:34:15,542
has a higher velocity than this
raisin has relative to this one.

491
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:19,772
So all of them will think that
they are special and you as a

492
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:24,011
raisin would
come up with Hubble's law.

493
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:28,433
You would conclude that the
velocity of your other raisins

494
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,613
are linearly proportional to the
distance.

495
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:36,034
There is an analogy which is
even nicer than raisin bread,

496
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,827
and that analogy is with
Flatlanders.

497
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:42,938
A Flatlander is someone who
lives on a two-dimensional

498
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:45,342
world.
He happens to live on the

499
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:49,143
surface of a balloon.
And light travels only along

500
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:55,197
the surface of the balloon.
So the two-dimensional world is

501
00:34:55,197 --> 00:35:00,46
curved in the third dimension,
but the Flatlanders cannot see

502
00:35:00,46 --> 00:35:04,933
in the third dimension.
They can only see the second

503
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:08,441
dimension.
So here you have such a world.

504
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,599
So here are the galaxies.
Flat world.

505
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,861
And the universe is curved in
the third dimension which these

506
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:21,509
Flatlanders cannot see.
And when you blow this balloon

507
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:26,217
up,
the galaxies move away from

508
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:33,128
each other, and the farther the
galaxies are away from each

509
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:40,515
other, the higher the velocity.
This model works actually quite

510
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:46,949
well and I want to pursue that
in my next calculations.

511
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:52,787
Let me first try to bring this
universe to a halt.

512
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:57,911
Because I don't want the
universe

513
00:35:57,911 --> 00:36:00,404
to collapse again.
Ooh.

514
00:36:00,404 --> 00:36:02,104
OK.
I succeeded.

515
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:08,791
So you can pursue this idea
very nicely and you can see that

516
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:14,684
the Flatlanders would draw quite
amazing conclusions.

517
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:20,124
Here is that balloon.
The balloon has a radius R.

518
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:25,337
Here is one galaxy.
And here is another galaxy.

519
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:30,438
And they are a distance S
apart.

520
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:35,392
I will call that later D.
But now I want to call it S.

521
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:39,13
You will see why.
A little later in time,

522
00:36:39,13 --> 00:36:44,178
the universe has expanded,
this galaxy is here and this

523
00:36:44,178 --> 00:36:48,478
galaxy is here.
And this distance now is R plus

524
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:53,712
dR and so this distance now
between the two galaxies is S

525
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:57,358
plus dS.
And it follows immediately from

526
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:04,8
the geometry that S plus dS
divided by S is R plus dR

527
00:37:04,8 --> 00:37:10,875
divided by R.
Simple high school geometry.

528
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:18,283
I can work this out.
I get S R plus R dS is SR plus

529
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:21,246
S dR.
I lose this SR.

530
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:27,321
I divide by dT.
dS dT is the velocity with

531
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:34,432
which these two
galaxies move away from each

532
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:38,448
other.
That's they what they would

533
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:44,169
measure in their universe.
So there is a V here.

534
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:49,767
It's clear that S is the
distance between them.

535
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:54,879
I will call that D again now.
So that is D.

536
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:59,503
And then I have one over R
times dR dT.

537
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:06,44
One over R I will write this a
little higher.

538
00:38:06,44 --> 00:38:09,402
dR over R.
No no no we had dR dT.

539
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:13,844
So now I have one over R dR dT.
And look at this.

540
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:16,897
I have V equals D times
something.

541
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:22,079
And that something at a given
moment in time has a unique

542
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,318
value.
R of the balloon has a unique

543
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:27,909
value.
And dR dT which is the

544
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:31,796
expansion velocity also has a
unique value.

545
00:38:31,796 --> 00:38:38,121
And so it's immediately obvious
that in this universe this is

546
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:41,617
Hubble's constant.
And this Hubble's constant is a

547
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:44,614
function of time.
It is changing with time.

548
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,895
And it's obvious that it should
change in time.

549
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:51,891
No reason why it shouldn't do
the same in our own galaxy.

550
00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:54,602
Because R in the past was much
smaller.

551
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:58,097
So even if you take an
expansion velocity which is

552
00:38:58,097 --> 00:39:02,521
constant, if R is smaller in the
past, then H was larger in the

553
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:04,946
past.
And that is the reason why if

554
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:08,586
you
ever see a quote of H to be

555
00:39:08,586 --> 00:39:12,394
seventy-two kilometers per
second per megaparsec,

556
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,012
there's always a little zero
here.

557
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:19,058
And the zero means now.
The zero means not a billion

558
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:22,39
years from now and not a billion
years ago.

559
00:39:22,39 --> 00:39:26,515
We really don't know what it
was a billion years ago.

560
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:31,116
Now don't get -- don't carry
this analogy between the two-D

561
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:34,527
balloon and the -- our own
universe too far.

562
00:39:34,527 --> 00:39:37,541
But it gives some interesting
insights.

563
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,96
It is suggestive
of the idea that our own

564
00:39:41,96 --> 00:39:46,265
three-dimensional space may be
curved in the fourth dimension

565
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:49,78
that we cannot see.
This is very fascinating and I

566
00:39:49,78 --> 00:39:54,012
would advise you if you are
interested in this area that you

567
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:57,886
take a course in cosmology.
You should also take one in

568
00:39:57,886 --> 00:40:01,401
general relativity.
It will open a whole new world

569
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,841
for you.
And both Allen Guth and Ed

570
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:07,93
Bertschinger and also Scott
Burles are the experts in this

571
00:40:07,93 --> 00:40:12,09
area and they happen to be one
of our best

572
00:40:12,09 --> 00:40:14,628
teachers.
So you can't lose there.

573
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:19,241
Now comes a key question and
that is will our universe expand

574
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,624
forever?
If the universe expands

575
00:40:21,624 --> 00:40:26,083
forever, we call that an open
universe, that's just a name.

576
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:30,389
It's also possible that our
universe will come to a halt.

577
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:33,157
That means that H,
Hubble's constant,

578
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:36,463
will become zero,
that everything will stand

579
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:40,461
still, no relative motion
anymore, which then will be

580
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:43,26
followed by
collapse.

581
00:40:43,26 --> 00:40:47,643
And so all the red shifts will
then come to zero and will turn

582
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:50,086
to blue shifts.
It's the same idea,

583
00:40:50,086 --> 00:40:53,32
the same question,
when you throw up an apple,

584
00:40:53,32 --> 00:40:57,344
will the apple come back or
will the apple not come back.

585
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,655
It depends on the speed of the
apple and on the gravitational

586
00:41:01,655 --> 00:41:04,96
field of the earth,
and we all know that if you

587
00:41:04,96 --> 00:41:08,409
throw it fast enough,
about eleven kilometers per

588
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:12,362
second in the absence of
atmosphere the

589
00:41:12,362 --> 00:41:16,503
apple would never come back.
Now if only gravity played the

590
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:20,288
key role in our universe,
then we can do a very simple

591
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:23,144
calculation.
And the answer to whether or

592
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:27,286
not our universe is open or
closed would then depend on the

593
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:31,713
average density of the universe.
And when I say average density

594
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:34,998
then you have to think in terms
of a big scale.

595
00:41:34,998 --> 00:41:37,64
You don't think in terms of
Cambridge.

596
00:41:37,64 --> 00:41:41,568
That's not representative for
the average density of the

597
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:45,833
universe.
Nor is our solar system.

598
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:50,649
Nor is our galaxy.
But you have to think probably

599
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:55,164
on the scale of a few hundred
million parsecs.

600
00:41:55,164 --> 00:42:01,385
Maybe five hundred megaparsecs.
And so I bring you out now into

601
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,797
the universe.
Here is the universe.

602
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:10,115
And these are galaxies.
And here is a sphere which has

603
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:15,433
a radius R and that's on a scale
of about five hundred

604
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:20,679
megaparsecs.
So rho, the average density,

605
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:23,882
is representative for the
universe.

606
00:42:23,882 --> 00:42:29,723
And here let's suppose you were
here, or I can take any part in

607
00:42:29,723 --> 00:42:33,68
the universe,
there's nothing special about

608
00:42:33,68 --> 00:42:39,332
it, and you see here a galaxy
and that galaxy moves away from

609
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:44,137
you with a velocity V.
That galaxy has a mass little

610
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:46,304
M.
The mass inside here,

611
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:52,05
capital M, inside this sphere,
is four-thirds pi R cubed times

612
00:42:52,05 --> 00:42:56,212
rho.
It's the average density,

613
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:59,31
right?
Now we know from Newton that

614
00:42:59,31 --> 00:43:05,051
the force that this galaxy will
experience is only determined by

615
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:10,336
the mass inside this sphere and
not by the mass outside the

616
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:13,616
sphere.
And so if I want to calculate

617
00:43:13,616 --> 00:43:18,81
whether these two objects will
forever move away from each

618
00:43:18,81 --> 00:43:23,456
other or whether they will fall
back to

619
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:28,878
each other then all I have to
make sure that I make the total

620
00:43:28,878 --> 00:43:34,21
energy zero, the sum of the
kinetic energy and the potential

621
00:43:34,21 --> 00:43:38,728
energy must be zero.
So one-half MV squared of this

622
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:42,071
object, it must be M M G divided
by R.

623
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:45,414
That is when the total energy
is zero.

624
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:51,017
We will expand forever and ever
and ever and it will never come

625
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:53,366
back.
Little M cancels out.

626
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:57,704
Capital M I can write
four-thirds

627
00:43:57,704 --> 00:44:03,125
pi R cubed rho.
Here comes my G and here comes

628
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:06,137
R.
Notice that the R cubed

629
00:44:06,137 --> 00:44:12,884
upstairs becomes R squared.
And so if I have an R squared

630
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:19,992
here and I have a V squared
here, remember that V divided by

631
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:25,293
R, that is Hubble's constant.
Because R is D,

632
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:31,92
it's the distance between us
and the galaxy.

633
00:44:31,92 --> 00:44:38,36
And so V squared divided by R
squared is the Hubble constant

634
00:44:38,36 --> 00:44:44,8
as we measure it today squared.
And so you'll find then from

635
00:44:44,8 --> 00:44:50,148
this simple result that rho as
it should be today,

636
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:56,916
that's why I put a little zero
there, is three divided by eight

637
00:44:56,916 --> 00:45:03,137
pi -- I get a G there,
and I get H zero squared.

638
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:08,719
And so this tells me that if
the density, the average density

639
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,625
of our universe,
is larger than this value,

640
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:17,741
then our universe will come to
a halt and will collapse.

641
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:20,625
And we can calculate that
value.

642
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:24,345
Because we know H zero,
we think we know,

643
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:30,206
we know G, and so you will find
then -- I'll write it down here,

644
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:35,043
that rho zero is about ten to
the minus

645
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:38,542
twenty-six kilograms per cubic
meter.

646
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:43,693
And so if rho is smaller than
this amount then we will

647
00:45:43,693 --> 00:45:48,942
continue to expand forever,
the universe would be open.

648
00:45:48,942 --> 00:45:54,385
If the mean density right now
is larger than that amount,

649
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:59,148
then we will -- the expansion
will come to a halt,

650
00:45:59,148 --> 00:46:04,397
red shift will become blue
shifts, and we will collapse

651
00:46:04,397 --> 00:46:06,535
again.
The matter here,

652
00:46:06,535 --> 00:46:12,417
this matter density,
doesn't have to be tomatoes or

653
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:15,393
potatoes.
It could be electromagnetic

654
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:18,782
radiation.
Because according to Einstein E

655
00:46:18,782 --> 00:46:22,006
equals MC squared.
So any form of energy

656
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:24,982
represents mass.
So don't think of it

657
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:30,025
necessarily as this being the
stars and galaxies and tomatoes.

658
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:34,571
It is generally believed today
that the expansion of our

659
00:46:34,571 --> 00:46:38,291
universe will not come to a halt
and collapse.

660
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:43,676
But our views could change.
Enormous development has been

661
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:47,463
going on in the last ten years
and you can read about that in

662
00:46:47,463 --> 00:46:50,367
the New York Times.
Almost every month you will

663
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,775
read something about the
enormous progress that's being

664
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:56,489
made in cosmology.
And of course the idea of

665
00:46:56,489 --> 00:46:59,456
whether or not the universe will
expand forever,

666
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:03,306
whether it's open or whether it
is closed, is something that's

667
00:47:03,306 --> 00:47:05,642
emotionally an important issue
for us.

668
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:09,429
If the universe is open and it
will expand forever then stars

669
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:13,027
will all burn out and the
universe will

670
00:47:13,027 --> 00:47:16,114
become a cold,
dead and boring place.

671
00:47:16,114 --> 00:47:21,001
If however the universe is
closed, the expansion will come

672
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:26,061
to a halt, it will collapse,
and it will end up with what we

673
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:30,005
call the Big Crunch as opposed
to the Big Bang.

674
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:33,692
And it will be hot,
there will be fireworks,

675
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:37,637
it will be like the early days
of the Big Bang.

676
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:40,638
Temperatures of billions of
degrees.

677
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:45,612
I'd like to read a poem from
Robert Frost which he wrote in

678
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,289
nineteen
twenty.

679
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:52,478
It's called Fire and Ice.
Some say the world will end in

680
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:55,981
fire, some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of

681
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:59,028
desire, I hold with those who
favor fire.

682
00:47:59,028 --> 00:48:03,522
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate

683
00:48:03,522 --> 00:48:07,026
to know that for destruction ice
is also great.

684
00:48:07,026 --> 00:48:10,682
And would suffice.
There are many people who want

685
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:15,023
our universe to be closed,
probably for emotional reasons,

686
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:18,831
maybe for religious reasons,
maybe

687
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:22,391
it's more esthetic,
maybe it's more reassuring,

688
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:25,332
maybe it's more romantic.
I don't know.

689
00:48:25,332 --> 00:48:29,046
But if it's open the end is not
very spectacular.

690
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:29,356
T.
S.

691
00:48:29,356 --> 00:48:32,684
Eliot wrote,
"This is the way the world ends

692
00:48:32,684 --> 00:48:37,404
not with a bang but a whimper."
Now it is conceivable that the

693
00:48:37,404 --> 00:48:41,815
expansion of the universe will
come to a halt and that the

694
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:44,369
universe will ultimately
collapse.

695
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:48,78
We will have a big crunch.
And it is even conceivable that

696
00:48:48,78 --> 00:48:52,634
a
new universe will then be born

697
00:48:52,634 --> 00:48:55,632
afterwards.
That there will be a new Big

698
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,169
Bang.
And if the evolution of that

699
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:02,166
universe were a carbon copy,
exact carbon copy of the

700
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:05,626
present universe,
a few thousand billion years

701
00:49:05,626 --> 00:49:09,393
from now we may have a great
eight oh two reunion.

702
00:49:09,393 --> 49:14
Same place same time same
people, perhaps see you then.
