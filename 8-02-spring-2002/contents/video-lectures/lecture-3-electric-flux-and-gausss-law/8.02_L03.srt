00:00:00 --> 00:00:08,082



2
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:16,406
Today we're going to um work on
a whole new concept and that is

3
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:23,253
the concept of electric flux.
We've come a long way.

4
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:27,684
We started out with Coulomb's
law.

5
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:35,471
We got electric field lines.
And now we have electric flux.

6
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:43,259
Suppose I have an electric
field which is like so

7
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,851
and I bring in that electric
field a surface,

8
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:52,86
an open surface like a
handkerchief or a piece of

9
00:00:52,86 --> 00:00:55,365
paper.
And so here it is.

10
00:00:55,365 --> 00:01:00,583
Something like that.
And I carve this surface up in

11
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:05,384
very small surface elements,
each with size DA,

12
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:09,559
that's the area,
teeny weeny little area,

13
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:15,09
and let this be the normal,
N roof, the normal on that

14
00:01:15,09 --> 00:01:20,959
surface.
So now the local electric field

15
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,218
say at that location would be
for instance this.

16
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:30,917
It's a vector.
The electric flux D phi that

17
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:37,295
goes through this little surface
now is defined as the dot

18
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:43,56
product of E and the vector
perpendicular to this element

19
00:01:43,56 --> 00:01:48,372
which has this as a magnitude
DA.

20
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:52,553
Now our book will always write
for NDA simply DA.

21
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:57,519
So I will do that also although
I don't like it but I will

22
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,658
follow the notation of the book.
So this vector DA is always

23
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:07,276
perpendicular to that little
element DA and it has the

24
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:10,934
magnitude DA.
And so this since it is a dot

25
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:15,813
product is the magnitude of E
times the area DA times the

26
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:21,09
cosine of the angle
between these two vectors,

27
00:02:21,09 --> 00:02:23,484
theta.
And this is scalar.

28
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:28,559
The number can be larger than
zero, smaller than zero,

29
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:33,059
and it can be zero.
And I can calculate the flux

30
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:38,421
through the entire surface by
doing an integral over that

31
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:42,06
whole surface.
The unit of flux follows

32
00:02:42,06 --> 00:02:47,805
immediately from the definition.
That is newtons per coulombs

33
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:54,708
for the units of this flux,
is newtons per coulombs times

34
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:59,02
square meters.
But no one ever thinks of it

35
00:02:59,02 --> 00:03:01,69
that way.
Just SU SI units.

36
00:03:01,69 --> 00:03:07,85
I can give you a some intuition
for this flux by comparing it

37
00:03:07,85 --> 00:03:13,087
first with an airflow.
These red arrows that you see

38
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:19,247
there represent the velocity of
air and you see there a black

39
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:22,346
rectangle
three times.

40
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:26,822
In the first case notice that
the normal to the surface of

41
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:31,377
that area is parallel to the
velocity vector of the air and

42
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:36,325
so if you want to know now what
the amount of air is in terms of

43
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:41,037
cubic meters per second going
through this rectangle it would

44
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:43,393
be V times A,
it's very simple.

45
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:48,026
However, if you rotate this
rectangle ninety degrees so that

46
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:52,738
the normal to that rectangle is
perpendicular to the velocity

47
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:56,668
vector,
nothing goes through that

48
00:03:56,668 --> 00:04:01,51
rectangle and so it's zero.
And so now the flux -- the air

49
00:04:01,51 --> 00:04:04,738
flux is zero,
and if the angle is sixty

50
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:09,58
degrees then it is of course V
times A times the cosine of

51
00:04:09,58 --> 00:04:13,317
sixty degrees.
Now think of these red vectors

52
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:17,479
as electric fields.
So now the electric flux going

53
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:22,746
in the first case through that
surface is now simply E times A.

54
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:27,673
In the second case it's zero.
And in the last case it is EA

55
00:04:27,673 --> 00:04:32,223
times
the cosine of sixty degrees.

56
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:36,769
So you can sometimes think of
this as airflows.

57
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:42,698
We also saw that when we dealt
with field lines that can come

58
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:47,936
in sometimes very handy.
I now take a surface which is

59
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:52,679
not open as this one is,
this is an open surface.

60
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:58,213
Can come in from both sides.
But now I choose one that is

61
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:03,997
completely closed.
Like a potato bag or a balloon.

62
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:08,817
I'll draw, put this line in
here to give you a feeling

63
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:12
there's a completely closed
surface.

64
00:05:12 --> 00:05:17,456
So you can only get inside if
you penetrate that surface from

65
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:21,094
the outside.
And so now I can put up here

66
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:25,823
and here these normals,
DA and there's another normal

67
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:31,188
here, maybe in this direction
DA, in this case by convention

68
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:36,183
the normal to the
surface locally to the surface

69
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:40,607
is always from the inside of the
surface to the outside world.

70
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,523
It's uniquely determined
because it's a closed surface.

71
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:47,061
Here it was not uniquely
determined.

72
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:51,412
I arbitrarily chose this one
but I could have flipped it over

73
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:55,401
a hundred eighty degrees since
it's an open surface it's

74
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:58,301
ill-defined.
Here it's never ill-defined.

75
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:02,507
So the normal is always chosen
to go from the inside to the

76
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:05,046
outside.
And now I can calculate the

77
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:09,241
total
flux going through this closed

78
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:12,442
surface.
Locally multiplying E with DA,

79
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:16,99
dot product over the whole
surface, out comes a certain

80
00:06:16,99 --> 00:06:21,539
number, and that is now
therefore the integral of E dot

81
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,762
DA integrated over that closed
surface and since it is a closed

82
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:31,816
surface we put a circle here to
remind us that it is a closed

83
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:37,375
integral and here in this case
it is a closed surface.

84
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:42,014
And this now is the total flux
through that surface.

85
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:47,379
It could be larger than zero.
It could be smaller than zero.

86
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,289
It's a scalar,
it's not a vector.

87
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:55,382
It could be equal to zero.
If it's equal to zero then you

88
00:06:55,382 --> 00:07:00,657
can think of it whatever flows
in if you think of it as air

89
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:04,84
also flows out.
If more flows out than flows in

90
00:07:04,84 --> 00:07:11,504
then it is positive.
If more flows in than flows out

91
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:16,939
it is negative.
So let's now calculate the flux

92
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:22,847
for a very simple case where I
have a point charge.

93
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:29,345
So here I have a point charge
and I'm going to put a bag

94
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:35,016
around this point charge and the
bag is a sphere.

95
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:42,223
It is a sphere and the sphere
has radius capital R.

96
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:47,941
And let this charge be plus Q.
Just for simplicity.

97
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:52,057
Well, I pick a small element DA
here.

98
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:56,288
And at element DA is radially
outward.

99
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:59,604
DA.
This is the normal to that

100
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:05,778
surface so that this radial.
The electric field at that

101
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:13,096
point is also radial.
We have dealt with that before.

102
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:18,82
So DA and E not only here but
anywhere on the surface of this

103
00:08:18,82 --> 00:08:23,303
sphere are parallel.
For the cosine of the angle

104
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:27,119
equals one.
I can also introduce here the

105
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:33,129
unit vector R roof which is the
unit vector going from capital Q

106
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:39,234
to that element where I evaluate
the teeny weeny little amount of

107
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:42,477
flux.
So if now I want to know what

108
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:46,44
the
total flux is through this

109
00:08:46,44 --> 00:08:51,971
sphere that's very easy because
since this is a sphere the E

110
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:56,938
vector in magnitude is
everywhere the same because the

111
00:08:56,938 --> 00:09:01,062
radius is the same,
the same distance to this

112
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:05,936
charge, and DA and E are
parallel, so it's simply the

113
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:10,435
surface four pi R squared of
that sphere times E.

114
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:14,559
And so now I have that the
total

115
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:21,25
flux through that closed
surface is simply four pi R

116
00:09:21,25 --> 00:09:25,317
squared times E.
Well what is E?

117
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:32,663
The electric field at this
distance R equals Q divided by

118
00:09:32,663 --> 00:09:38,304
four pi epsilon zero R squared
times R roof.

119
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:46,175
That gives me the direction and
so if I know that the flux is

120
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:51,73
four pi R
squared times E I put the four

121
00:09:51,73 --> 00:09:56,323
pi R squared here,
I lose the four pi R squared,

122
00:09:56,323 --> 00:10:01,99
and I find that the E vector,
at least the magnitude of the

123
00:10:01,99 --> 00:10:06,779
electric field -- uh excuse me,
that the flux phi,

124
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,958
that's what I want to
calculate, I multiply this by E,

125
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,085
equals Q divided by epsilon
zero.

126
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:20,361
And this is independent of the
distance R.

127
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:24,984
And that's not so surprising
because if you think of it as

128
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:30,093
air flowing out then all the air
has to come out somehow whether

129
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:34,878
I make the sphere this big or
whether I make the sphere this

130
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:37,554
big.
So the flux being independent

131
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:42,095
of the size of my sphere,
the flux is given by the charge

132
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:46,717
which is right here at the
center divided by epsilon zero.

133
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:50,772
Now if I had chosen some other
shape, not a sphere,

134
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:56,868
but I have dented it like this,
it's clear that the air that

135
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:59,825
flows out would be exactly the
same.

136
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:04,556
And so I don't have to take a
sphere to find this result.

137
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:09,54
I could have taken any type of
strange closed surface around

138
00:11:09,54 --> 00:11:14,271
this point charge and I would
have found exactly the same

139
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:17,059
result.
And if I put more than one

140
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:22,043
charge inside this potato bag
then clearly since I know that

141
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:27,619
electric fields from different
charges can be added,

142
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:33,427
should be added vectorially,
it is clear that the relation

143
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:39,133
should also hold for any
collection of charges inside the

144
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:45,451
bag and therefore we now arrive
at our first milestone in eight

145
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:48,814
oh two, which we call Gauss's
law.

146
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:54,214
And Gauss's law says that the
flux, the electric flux,

147
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:59,105
going through a closed surface,
being

148
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:05,599
the closed surface of E dot DA
is the sum of all charges Q

149
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:12,321
which are inside the bag that
you may choose at any time you

150
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:16,537
pick that bag divided by epsilon
zero.

151
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:23,258
And this is the first of four
equations of Maxwell which are

152
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:29,638
at the heart of this course.
So the electric flux through

153
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:33,419
any
closed surface is always the

154
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,868
charge inside that closed
surface divided by epsilon zero.

155
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:42,551
And if that flux happens to be
zero, it means there is no net

156
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:46,142
charge inside the bag.
There could be positive,

157
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:50,2
there could be negative
charges, but the net is zero.

158
00:12:50,2 --> 00:12:54,493
Gauss's law always holds.
No matter how weird the charge

159
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:58,942
distribution inside the bag.
No matter how weird the shape

160
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:02,298
of this bag.
It always holds.

161
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:06,388
But Gauss's law won't help you
very much if you don't have a

162
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:10,13
situation whereby the charges
are distributed in a very

163
00:13:10,13 --> 00:13:12,764
symmetric way.
Gauss's law holds but it

164
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:16,922
doesn't do you any good if you
want to calculate the electric

165
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,793
field.
In order to calculate

166
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:23,021
successfully the electric field
you do need forms of symmetry,

167
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:27,11
and there are three forms of
symmetry that we will deal with

168
00:13:27,11 --> 00:13:30,021
in eight oh two.
One is of course spherical

169
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:32,447
symmetry.
Another one is cylindrical

170
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:37,429
symmetry.
And a third one is flat planes

171
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:41,078
with uniformly charged
distributions.

172
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,133
Then we also have situations of
symmetry.

173
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:51,52
And so now I would like to as a
first example use an application

174
00:13:51,52 --> 00:13:57,602
of Gauss's law and I will start
with a situation of spherical

175
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,846
symmetry.
And I use a thin shell,

176
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:05,206
a hollow sphere,
which is thin,

177
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:09,349
and so this radius is R and I
put charge Q on here but it is

178
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,947
uniformly distributed.
That's crucial.

179
00:14:11,947 --> 00:14:15,598
If it's not uniformly
distributed I have no symmetry,

180
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:19,32
I can't do the problem.
So it's uniformly distributed.

181
00:14:19,32 --> 00:14:23,393
We will learn later in the
course that it's very easy to do

182
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:27,536
this because any conductor of
this shape if you bring charge

183
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:31,187
on it will automatically
distribute itself uniformly.

184
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:35,33
So we have the charge plus Q on
there uniformly distributed,

185
00:14:35,33 --> 00:14:38,912
that's a must,
and I would like to

186
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:43,151
know now what is the electric
field here at a distance R from

187
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:47,179
the center and what is the
electric -- electric field here

188
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:51,489
at a distance R from the center.
In other words I want to know

189
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,74
what is the electric field
everywhere in space.

190
00:14:54,74 --> 00:14:58,414
Just due to this charged --
uniformly charged sphere.

191
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:01,453
And with Gauss's law it just
goes like that.

192
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,35
You now have to choose your
Gauss surface.

193
00:15:04,35 --> 00:15:08,448
And if you don't choose it in a
clever way you get nowhere.

194
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:12,193
In a case like this I would
think it

195
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:16,113
is rather obvious that the
Gauss surface that you would

196
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:19,67
choose are themselves spheres,
concentric spheres.

197
00:15:19,67 --> 00:15:23,953
If you want to know what the
electric field is at this point

198
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:28,018
you choose a sphere with this
radius R going through that

199
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:32,156
point and if you want to know
what it here is you choose a

200
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:36,003
sphere going through that point.
All the way enclosed.

201
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:39,488
It's a concentric sphere.
And now you have to use

202
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:43,045
symmetry arguments.
And the symmetry arguments are

203
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:45,12
the
following.

204
00:15:45,12 --> 00:15:48,174
Since this is spherically
symmetric, this problem,

205
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:51,104
if you were here,
whatever the electric field is

206
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:54,844
here in magnitude must be the
same as it is there and it must

207
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:58,397
be the same as it is there.
Because of the symmetry of the

208
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:01,826
problem, it couldn't be any
larger here than it could be

209
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,072
here.
That's obvious.

210
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:06,314
That's a symmetry argument
because the charge here is

211
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:09,617
uniformly distributed.
That's symmetry argument number

212
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:11,487
one.
Now comes another symmetry

213
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,918
argument.
And that is the electric field

214
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,39
if
there is an electric field must

215
00:16:17,39 --> 00:16:20,958
be either radially pointing
outwards or radially pointing

216
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,188
inwards.
So either it has to be like

217
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:26,247
this or it has to be like this
and here the same.

218
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:30,134
Either like this or like this.
Because we already know if this

219
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:33,893
is a positive charge then it's
going to be pointing outward.

220
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:37,653
It cannot go like this or like
this because nature could not

221
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:41,093
decide in this spherically
symmetric problem to go like

222
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:43,77
this or like this.
It can only go radially.

223
00:16:43,77 --> 00:16:47,211
That's the second symmetry
argument.

224
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:51,733
So now if we go to this sphere
now and we know that E is

225
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:55,927
radially outwards apart from a
plus or a minus sign,

226
00:16:55,927 --> 00:17:00,532
apart from the fact that the
angle between DA and E could

227
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:04,644
either be zero degrees or a
hundred eighty degrees,

228
00:17:04,644 --> 00:17:08,591
we know now that the surface
area of that sphere,

229
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:13,114
which is four pi R squared,
times the magnitude of the E

230
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:16,897
vector right here,
I can do that now because DA

231
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:21,585
and E are either parallel or
antiparallel.

232
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:25,988
That must be equal to Q inside
divided by epsilon zero.

233
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:29,169
There is no Q inside,
so E must be zero.

234
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:33,327
That's an amazing result.
You say well uh there's no

235
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:36,426
charge inside.
Still an amazing result.

236
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:40,993
Because it means that anywhere
inside here no matter what

237
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:45,56
radius you choose the electric
field equals exactly zero.

238
00:17:45,56 --> 00:17:50,616
And it means that if some crazy
conspiracy of all these charges

239
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:55,182
that are uniformly distributed
here which

240
00:17:55,182 --> 00:18:00,187
each individually contribute to
the electric field inside

241
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:05,729
through Coulomb's law that all
those together can for through a

242
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:10,197
conspiracy make the E field
everywhere inside zero.

243
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:13,325
It's a nontrivial result.
All right.

244
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,437
So now we know that the E field
inside is zero.

245
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:20,207
So this is for R smaller than
R.

246
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:25,57
Let's now go R larger than R.
Everything I told you holds for

247
00:18:25,57 --> 00:18:29,378
the
sphere which is outside this

248
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,813
hollow sphere.
Everything holds.

249
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:36,447
The E field here must be the
same everywhere on the surface.

250
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:39,903
DA and E are either parallel or
antiparallel.

251
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:44,615
So I can write down again that
four pi R squared which is the

252
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:49,092
surface area times the electric
field vector must be the Q

253
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:53,098
inside divided by epsilon zero
but this Q is that Q.

254
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,004
It's not zero.
There is charge inside.

255
00:18:56,004 --> 00:19:00,638
And so now I know that the
electric field E

256
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:05,43
in terms of its magnitude is Q
divided by four pi R squared

257
00:19:05,43 --> 00:19:09,065
epsilon zero.
And we know the direction if it

258
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,939
is positive of course it is
radially outwards and if this is

259
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:18,483
negative it's radially inwards.
And this is a nontrivial

260
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:21,126
result.
We have seen this before.

261
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:26
If I have put all the charge
right here at the middle at the

262
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30,214
center we would have gotten
exactly the same answer.

263
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:34,096
We've seen that before.
In other

264
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:39,208
words whether the charge is
uniformly distributed over a

265
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:44,971
sphere or whether the charge is
all of it exactly at the center

266
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:48,875
of the sphere,
that makes no difference for

267
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:53,336
the E field as long as you're
outside the sphere.

268
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:58,913
If you plot the electric field
as a function of R and if here

269
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:03,839
is capital R and if this is the
-- the field strength,

270
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,694
then you would get that the
electric field is zero

271
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:14,634
inside, jumps to a maximum
value and this falls off as one

272
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:18,88
over R squared proportional to
one over R squared.

273
00:20:18,88 --> 00:20:23,733
If I go back to the situation
that the charge -- that the

274
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:29,019
electric field inside is zero,
you may say isn't that a little

275
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,005
bit of a cheat.
Because yeah there is no charge

276
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:36,038
inside.
But have you really used the

277
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:40,025
charge outside.
And if you have used it how did

278
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:42,081
you
use it.

279
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:45,489
Well I have used it.
I use it through my symmetry

280
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:48,116
arguments.
The symmetry arguments take

281
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:51,879
into account that the charge is
uniformly distributed.

282
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:56,352
If the charge on the sphere had
not been uniformly distributed I

283
00:20:56,352 --> 00:21:00,47
could not have used the symmetry
argument and therefore the

284
00:21:00,47 --> 00:21:04,304
electric field inside would in
fact not have been zero.

285
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:08,635
If there is more charge on the
sphere here than there is there

286
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,404
the field inside the sphere is
not zero.

287
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:17,598
So I have used all that charge
by using my symmetry argument.

288
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:22,707
Gauss's law and Coulomb's law
in a way are the same law.

289
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:27,444
They both link the electric
field with the charge Q.

290
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:32,552
Key is the fact that the
electric force falls off as one

291
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:36,639
over R square.
If the electric field strength

292
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:42,026
did not fall off as one over R
square Gauss's law would not

293
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:45,649
even hold.
And the electric field inside

294
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:49,942
this
uniformly charged sphere would

295
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,914
not be zero.
So it is the immediate

296
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:58,07
consequence of the fact that
electric forces fall off as one

297
00:21:58,07 --> 00:22:02,003
over R squared.
Gravitational forces also fall

298
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:06,897
off as one over R squared.
Therefore if you take a planet

299
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:12,054
if it existed which is a hollow
spherically spherical planet

300
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:17,036
with hollow inside it means
there would be no

301
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,709
gravitational field inside that
hollow planet.

302
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:25,363
So if you were there there
would be no gravitational force

303
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:27,486
on you.
If it is spherical.

304
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:32,221
If that planet were a cubical
planet then the gravitational

305
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:36,548
field inside would not be zero.
You say well big deal,

306
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:41,284
with eight oh one we always
take a planet and then it's not

307
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:45,938
as far as we're outside the
planet we put all the mass and

308
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:49,04
we consider it as a point.
Yeah indeed.

309
00:22:49,04 --> 00:22:52,711
It's
not a big deal for you and it

310
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:56,557
is not a big deal for me but it
was a big deal for Newton.

311
00:22:56,557 --> 00:23:00,538
He intuitively sensed that it
was correct that if you have a

312
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:03,71
planet of uniform mass
distribution that you can

313
00:23:03,71 --> 00:23:07,488
consider it as a point mass as
long as you're outside the

314
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:10,052
planet.
But it took him twenty years to

315
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:13,089
prove it and he finally
published his results.

316
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:15,45
It would take us now thirty
seconds.

317
00:23:15,45 --> 00:23:17,88
He didn't have access to
Gauss's law.

318
00:23:17,88 --> 00:23:21,318
Came about a hundred years
later.

319
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:26,164
But the net result is that you
see here in front of you that if

320
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:29,135
you have uniformly charge
distribution,

321
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:32,418
and you can draw the parallel
with gravity,

322
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:36,874
that it's you get the same
electric field outside that you

323
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:41,096
would have gotten if all the
charge is at one location.

324
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:44,301
At the center.
This is spherical symmetry,

325
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:47,271
number one.
That's the easiest symmetry

326
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:51,805
that we have in eight oh two.
Now I will present you with a

327
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:56,033
second
form of symmetry which is a

328
00:23:56,033 --> 00:24:00,648
flat horizontal plane.
And I want you to work out most

329
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:04,915
of it but I'll help you a little
bit to set it up.

330
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:09,094
Suppose we have a plane which
is very very large.

331
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:12,49
Think of it for now as
infinitely large.

332
00:24:12,49 --> 00:24:16,409
That doesn't exist of course
infinitely large.

333
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:21,634
And I put on this plane charge.
And I put a certain amount of

334
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:25,814
charge density which I call
sigma.

335
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,829
Sigma is an amount of charge Q
per area A.

336
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:32,802
So it is a certain number of
coulombs per square meter.

337
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:37,215
And it's uniformly distributed,
so the whole plane everywhere

338
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:40,746
has the same number of coulombs
per square meter.

339
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,1
Or microcoulombs or
nanocoulombs,

340
00:24:43,1 --> 00:24:46,63
whatever you prefer.
And this is a plane which is

341
00:24:46,63 --> 00:24:50,603
huge and you are being asked
what is the electric field

342
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:54,207
anywhere in space,
just like we before we ask what

343
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:57,681
is
the electric field anywhere

344
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:01,45
inside the sphere and anywhere
outside the sphere.

345
00:25:01,45 --> 00:25:06,141
Now I want to know what it is
anywhere in the vicinity of this

346
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:08,91
plane.
If now you pick a clever Gauss

347
00:25:08,91 --> 00:25:11,987
surface the answer pops out very
quickly.

348
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:16,678
If you would choose a sphere as
a Gauss surface you're dead in

349
00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:20,908
the waters, you get nowhere
because there's no spherical

350
00:25:20,908 --> 00:25:23,6
symmetry.
I will define for you that

351
00:25:23,6 --> 00:25:28,966
Gauss surface
but I want you to work out at

352
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:32,75
home how you get the electric
field.

353
00:25:32,75 --> 00:25:39,454
Suppose I want to know what the
electric field is at a distance

354
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:44,644
D above the plane.
What I do now is I choose this

355
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:48,644
as my Gauss surface.
Watch me closely.

356
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:52,861
This is the intersection with
the plane.

357
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:59,178
This is my Gauss surface.
It is a closed surface.

358
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:05,424
Three conditions have to be met
for you to be able to calculate

359
00:26:05,424 --> 00:26:09,353
what the E vector is at that
location D.

360
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:15,598
The first one is that this is a
flat plane here and this is the

361
00:26:15,598 --> 00:26:20,333
same flat plane.
Must be parallel to this plane.

362
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:24,766
That's a must.
If you don't do that you can't

363
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:30,508
use Gauss's law.
The second one is that these

364
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:35,526
vertical walls that you have
here are indeed perpendicular to

365
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,454
that plane.
In other words these are

366
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:42,135
parallel and these are ver-
exactly vertical.

367
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:47,154
If you don't make them vertical
if you do this you're dead in

368
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:50,249
the waters.
Can't use Gauss's law very

369
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:53,511
effectively.
And then the third argument

370
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:58,446
which is very important that
this flat surface is a distance

371
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:03,633
D above the plane and that this
flat surface is

372
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:06,476
exactly the same distance below
the plane.

373
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:09,736
And you can already smell why
that is important.

374
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:13,759
Because if you ever want to use
a symmetry argument if this

375
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,851
plane is uniformly charged the
electric field vector here in

376
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:21,735
terms of magnitude obviously
must be the same as there in

377
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:24,509
terms of magnitude,
maybe not in terms of

378
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,977
direction, as long as this D is
the same as that D.

379
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:31,93
So that's why it's important
that the two Ds are the same.

380
00:27:31,93 --> 00:27:37,272
And the only charge that you
have inside when you apply

381
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:41,457
Gauss's law is the charge which
is of course here.

382
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:45,3
That's the only charge inside
that closed box.

383
00:27:45,3 --> 00:27:50,425
If you work this out at home
you will find an amazing result.

384
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:55,378
You will find that the electric
flux through these vertical

385
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:59,051
walls is zero.
Nothing comes out through the

386
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:01,613
vertical walls.
Think about it.

387
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:05,884
Why that is.
Use symmetry arguments.

388
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,65
But something comes out here or
comes in here if it is a

389
00:28:09,65 --> 00:28:12,595
negative charge and something
goes out here.

390
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:16,43
And so you only have two
contributions from those two end

391
00:28:16,43 --> 00:28:18,758
plates.
You'll work on that and you

392
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:22,662
will find perhaps to your
amazing result that the electric

393
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:26,771
field equals sigma divided by
two epsilon zero and that it is

394
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,921
independent of how far you are
from that plane.

395
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:34,03
Whether you're very far away or
whether you're close it's the

396
00:28:34,03 --> 00:28:36,496
same.
So if this is that plane and if

397
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:40,378
the
plane is positively charged

398
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:45,569
then E would be like this here
and E would be like this here

399
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:51,024
and it would be independent of
distance and if it is negatively

400
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:56,038
charged E would be like so and
it would be like -- like so

401
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,493
pointing towards the plane and
in all cases would the magnitude

402
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:04,66
be sigma divided by two epsilon
zero.

403
00:29:04,66 --> 00:29:08,708
Does it mean if I go very far
away

404
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:12,465
from that plane that it is
still independent of the

405
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:14,794
distance?
Yeah, if that plane is

406
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:18,101
infinitely large.
But if the plane is only as

407
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:22,685
large as the lecture hall here
then clearly it would hold very

408
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:27,044
accurately as long as I stay
relatively close to the plane.

409
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:31,477
In other words if my distance
to the plane is small compared

410
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:35,61
to the linear size of the plane.
But if I go miles away,

411
00:29:35,61 --> 00:29:40,044
well of course then that plane
is charged looks like a point

412
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,567
charge
if I'm five miles away from

413
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:47,489
twenty-six one hundred if the
plane is only as large as this

414
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:51,677
lecture hall then it looks like
a point charge and obviously the

415
00:29:51,677 --> 00:29:55,333
electric field will then fall
off as one over R squared.

416
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:59,056
So when I say the E field
doesn't change with distance it

417
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:02,911
means of course that you have to
be relatively close to the

418
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:06,302
surface relative to the linear
size of that surface.

419
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:10,423
So you are going to prove this
and I'm going to use this now to

420
00:30:10,423 --> 00:30:16,183
calculate for you a much more
complicated configuration of

421
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:20,138
two charged planes but I use
that result.

422
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:25,279
That's very important.
And suppose I have here a -- a

423
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,025
plate, very large,
nothing is infinitely large of

424
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:35,858
course, and it has a surface
charge density plus sigma and I

425
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:41,296
have here a plate which has
surface charge density minus

426
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:46,634
sigma and the separation between
these two

427
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:51,53
plates happens to be D.
And the question now is what is

428
00:30:51,53 --> 00:30:54,794
the electric field anywhere in
space.

429
00:30:54,794 --> 00:30:58,965
Here, here and here.
And we'll think of them as

430
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:02,048
being infinitely large,
each plate.

431
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:05,765
And I now use the superposition
principle.

432
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:09,119
I say to myself aha.
This plate alone,

433
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,29
forget this one,
this plate alone would give me

434
00:31:13,29 --> 00:31:17,732
an E vector oh stick to my
colors,

435
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:22,618
give me an E vector like so and
that is sigma divided by two

436
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:26,178
epsilon zero,
this one is also pointing away

437
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,821
from this, sigma divided by two
epsilon zero,

438
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:34,044
and here it's also sigma
divided by two epsilon zero

439
00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:38,515
because it's independent of the
distance to this plate.

440
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:41,247
What is the negative charge
doing?

441
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:46,133
Well, the negative charge has E
vectors pointing towards it.

442
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:50,272
So here I have an E vector
which is

443
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,53
sigma divided by two epsilon
zero.

444
00:31:52,53 --> 00:31:56,636
Here I have one that is sigma
divided by two epsilon zero and

445
00:31:56,636 --> 00:31:59,715
I have one that is pointing
towards the plate,

446
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:02,588
which is sigma divided by two
epsilon zero.

447
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:06,146
I use the superposition
principle, I can add electric

448
00:32:06,146 --> 00:32:10,183
vectors and when I do that I
find that these two cancel each

449
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:13,194
other out so the electric field
here is zero.

450
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:17,025
The electric field here is
sigma divided by epsilon zero.

451
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:20,583
The two support each other.
They are both in the same

452
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:25,155
direction.
And the electric field here is

453
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:28,692
again zero.
And that is an amazing result.

454
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:34,126
Of course it's only accurate if
these plates are extraordinarily

455
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:39,474
large and so if I have to draw
the field lines in the situation

456
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:43,528
like this then the field lines
would be like so.

457
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:48,703
If the upper plate is positive
and the field in here would be

458
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:52,584
the same everywhere,
would be outside zero and

459
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:57,419
outside zero here.
Now clearly this cannot be true

460
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,367
if you get into this area here
where you are near the end of

461
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:03,642
these plates.
That is not possible.

462
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:05,716
Why not?
Well you can't use your

463
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:09,73
symmetry arguments so Gauss's
law is not going to help you if

464
00:33:09,73 --> 00:33:13,678
you get anywhere near this area.
And it is very difficult to

465
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:17,626
calculate the electric field
configuration when you are near

466
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:20,838
the edges, which we call the --
the fringe field.

467
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:24,919
Maxwell of course was a clever
man and he knew how to do that.

468
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,816
Today we can also do that
very easily with uh computers.

469
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:33,384
But I'll show you from
Maxwell's original publications

470
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:37,692
that in a situation like that he
was already perfectly capable of

471
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:41,732
calculating these electric field
lines and you have these two

472
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:45,03
horizontal plates,
which one is plus and which one

473
00:33:45,03 --> 00:33:48,733
is minus doesn't matter,
he doesn't put arrows in there,

474
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:52,166
and what you see is an
extremely strong field inside

475
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:55,128
the two plates,
and remember that the density

476
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:58,831
of field lines tells you
something about the strength of

477
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:02,207
the
[inaudible] very strong field

478
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:06,2
but when you get near the edge
the field is not really zero.

479
00:34:06,2 --> 00:34:10,329
The field strength drops very
rapidly because look the density

480
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:12,427
is very low.
But it is not zero.

481
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:16,555
And the electric field is not
zero here either and is not zero

482
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,585
there.
In our assumption in our

483
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:22,511
simplification we have however
assumed that the plate is so

484
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:26,436
large that we don't have to
worry about any end effects and

485
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:30,971
in that case the electric field
is only existent in

486
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:34,218
between the plates but not
anywhere else.

487
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:38,927
I now want to demonstrate to
you some of the things that we

488
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:42,986
have learned today.
And the first thing that I want

489
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:47,533
to demonstrate is that the
electric field outside a large

490
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:52,566
plane is more or less constant.
Doesn't matter how far away you

491
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:55,083
are.
Now the way I'm going to do

492
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:59,467
that is of course I don't have
an infinite large plane,

493
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:03,445
the plane that you're going to
see

494
00:35:03,445 --> 00:35:05,328
only a few square meters in
size.

495
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:08,152
And so with only something like
one by one meter,

496
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:11,859
then it would only be true that
the electric field is very close

497
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,565
to constant if I stay very close
to that plane.

498
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:18,037
The moment that I go out as far
as a meter of course it's no

499
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:20,214
longer true.
So it's very qualitative,

500
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:23,45
what I'm going to show you.
But you're going to see very

501
00:35:23,45 --> 00:35:25,332
shortly there a very large
plane.

502
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,45
I'm going to get it in a few
minutes.

503
00:35:27,45 --> 00:35:30,451
And let's assume that we look
at that plane edge on.

504
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:33,158
So here is that plane.
Look at it from edge on,

505
00:35:33,158 --> 00:35:37,22
it will be put here.
It will block your view,

506
00:35:37,22 --> 00:35:39,392
that's why we don't have it up
now.

507
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,777
And what I will do now is I
will connect that with the

508
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:46,673
VandeGraaff which is behind it.
If you wait a few minutes then

509
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:49,547
class will pay attention to me
and not to you.

510
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,251
Uh here is the VandeGraaff,
we're going to attach it to the

511
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:57,338
VandeGraaff and then we use this
interesting fishing rod which is

512
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:01,298
a small Mylar balloon which we
will charge with the same charge

513
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:05,449
as the VandeGraaff,
the same charge as the plate,

514
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:08,87
and we will hold that in front
of the plane.

515
00:36:08,87 --> 00:36:12,051
And then of course there will
be a force.

516
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:15,631
So here is my glass rod.
This is the vertical.

517
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:19,608
And because there will be a
repelling force on this

518
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:22,949
air-filled balloon,
there will be an angle.

519
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:27,721
There's an electric force on it
because the two have the same

520
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:30,426
charge.
And this is the angle theta

521
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:35,119
that I will show you projected
on that wall.

522
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,977
And when I move this away from
this plane you will see that the

523
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:42,587
angle theta becomes smaller.
Yes of course because look how

524
00:36:42,587 --> 00:36:45,512
small that plane is.
No matter what I do if I go

525
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:49,308
from twenty to forty centimeters
you can't really say that the

526
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:52,731
plane is infinitely large
compared to forty centimeters.

527
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:56,216
But you will see that the angle
of theta will change very

528
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,394
slowly.
And then we will remove that

529
00:36:58,394 --> 00:37:01,879
plane and then we will do
exactly the same experiment but

530
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:06,297
we will use only the VandeGraaff
which produces now an

531
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:09,333
electric field.
And that electric field now

532
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:13,887
falls off as one over R squared.
It's not constant as a function

533
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:17,5
of distance but it falls off as
one over R squared.

534
00:37:17,5 --> 00:37:21,331
This is a hollow sphere.
So you can think of it as all

535
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,945
the charge right at the center.
As we demonstrated,

536
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:27,33
it's on the blackboard still
here.

537
00:37:27,33 --> 00:37:30,004
You know, you get that amazing
result.

538
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:34,124
And so now if I place this --
if I place this fishing rod,

539
00:37:34,124 --> 00:37:37,666
this balloon,
near the spherical

540
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:43,091
VandeGraaff you will see that
this angle theta drops very fast

541
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:45,937
when I start moving my hand
away.

542
00:37:45,937 --> 00:37:50,562
Extraordinarily fast.
If I double the distance to the

543
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:55,899
center the force on that little
object will become four times

544
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,567
smaller.
It's inverse R square.

545
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:04,082
So let's first do the plane and
then we'll try to do the -- the

546
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:08,618
uh single VandeGraaff.
And we'll try to optimize the

547
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:11,561
light
conditions.

548
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:16,534
We have a projection here.
There's a carbon arc.

549
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:22,566
Which will hopefully produce
some light in that direction.

550
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:28,174
If the carbon arc works.
[laughter] Marcos oh I forgot

551
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:31,454
to turn on the power.
Thank you.

552
00:38:31,454 --> 00:38:37,698
So this carbon arc is coming on
now and you'll see there the

553
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:42,565
shadows on that wall.
See my hand,

554
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:45,978
here is that plane,
and it is far from infinitely

555
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:49,249
large, that plane.
If I were this far away from

556
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:52,52
it, four centimeters,
very close approximation,

557
00:38:52,52 --> 00:38:56,643
it would be infinitely large.
But if I'm here and there and

558
00:38:56,643 --> 00:39:00,412
that's where I will be,
of course it is not infinitely

559
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:02,9
large anymore.
So let's uh start the

560
00:39:02,9 --> 00:39:05,744
VandeGraaff.
You can see that I turned it

561
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,237
on.
It's rotating now.

562
00:39:07,237 --> 00:39:11,006
I have to put charge on here so
I'll touch it with the

563
00:39:11,006 --> 00:39:15,13
VandeGraaff and so this is now
charged.

564
00:39:15,13 --> 00:39:17,657
It has the same charge as the
plane.

565
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:21,556
The plane is being charged.
And here you see the angle.

566
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:25,095
Try to remember that angle.
It's hard to estimate,

567
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:28,922
maybe fifteen degrees.
You see the vertical and if now

568
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:33,038
I -- it's about um thirty
centimeters away from the plane.

569
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:37,443
And if now I go back to fifty
centimeters, which is where I am

570
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:40,837
now, you see the angle hasn't
changed very much.

571
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,797
If I go further out,
to sixty centimeters,

572
00:39:43,797 --> 00:39:47,552
yeah, the angle goes down a
little.

573
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,251
Of course it does.
But not very much.

574
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:53,85
And if I go far away,
all the way to Mass Avenue,

575
00:39:53,85 --> 00:39:58,273
of course the force on this
little object would be inversely

576
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:02,996
R squared because then the whole
plane would behave like a point

577
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:05,545
source.
So I've shown you that very

578
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:09,818
close to this plane the electric
field stays approximately

579
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:12,367
constant.
So if now we remove this,

580
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:16,265
Marcos if you can yeah,
you'll have to take this also

581
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:19,356
off.
Thank you very much.

582
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:22,086
So now we have the VandeGraaff
alone.

583
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,18
So now we know that the
electric field falls off as one

584
00:40:26,18 --> 00:40:29,592
over R squared.
It's a very good approximation

585
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:32,095
now.
We can think of the charge as

586
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:36,341
being right at the center.
I will give it a little bit of

587
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,843
charge.
Oh, it is already charged.

588
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:41,876
[laughter] OK.
So look at the projection.

589
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:46,426
The uh the balloon is now uh oh
maybe thirty centimeters away

590
00:40:46,426 --> 00:40:49,989
from the center,
maybe forty,

591
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,371
boy, the angle is almost
forty-five degrees.

592
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:56,124
And now I go,
I double the distance,

593
00:40:56,124 --> 00:40:59,978
I go to about ninety
centimeters, and look at that

594
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:03,281
angle theta.
The angle theta is now down to

595
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:07,056
oh maybe ten degrees.
I will go back where I was.

596
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:09,651
This angle is about forty
degrees.

597
00:41:09,651 --> 00:41:14,213
And now it's very small and
when I go here which is about a

598
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:18,853
meter-and-a-half you can hardly
see that there is any angle.

599
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:24,441
It's only a few degrees.
And so I've shown you only

600
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:29,896
qualitatively that the electric
field falls off very rapidly.

601
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:34,624
In the vicinity of a hollow
uniformly charged sphere.

602
00:41:34,624 --> 00:41:40,079
And that it doesn't fall off
very fast if you are in the near

603
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,716
vicinity of a plane.
The second thing I want to show

604
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:50,08
you has to do with the fact that
the electric field inside a

605
00:41:50,08 --> 00:41:54,005
uniformly charged sphere is
zero.

606
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:57,729
Here I have a sphere which is
not entirely closed.

607
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:02,136
I can't make it closed because
I want to demonstrate to you

608
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:06,24
that there is no electric field
inside when I charge it

609
00:42:06,24 --> 00:42:09,279
uniformly.
And since I have to get inside

610
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,927
I need an opening.
There's nothing I can do about

611
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:15,13
it.
Since there is an opening,

612
00:42:15,13 --> 00:42:18,55
the electric field is not
exactly zero inside.

613
00:42:18,55 --> 00:42:22,881
It's only true if this is a
complete closed surface and if

614
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:26,985
the charge is uniformly
distributed.

615
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:31,156
But it's a good approximation.
The opening is quite small.

616
00:42:31,156 --> 00:42:35,474
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to charge this sphere.

617
00:42:35,474 --> 00:42:39,719
I'm putting charge outside.
I use a device that we have not

618
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,184
used before, but that's not so
important, but here is now that

619
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:47,112
hollow sphere.
I'm going to put charge on

620
00:42:47,112 --> 00:42:49,6
there.
Let's suppose it is positive

621
00:42:49,6 --> 00:42:52,015
charge.
So this will be positively

622
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:54,723
charged.
Since it is a -- a conductor,

623
00:42:54,723 --> 00:42:58,519
as we
will learn I think the next

624
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:02,565
lecture or at least this week,
that the charge will

625
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:06,936
automatically distribute
uniformly, only does that on a

626
00:43:06,936 --> 00:43:11,225
conductor, and now to
demonstrate to you that there is

627
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:14,786
an electric field here,
I will use induction.

628
00:43:14,786 --> 00:43:19,319
I have two Ping Pong balls
painted with conducting paint.

629
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:22,961
They touch each other.
Under influence of this

630
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:27,493
electric field this one will
become negative and this one

631
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:32,434
will become positive,
we have discussed that last

632
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:36,182
time, you create a dipole.
Not important that it is a

633
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:38,057
dipole.
I separate the two.

634
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:41,877
I have negative charge here and
positive charge there.

635
00:43:41,877 --> 00:43:45,986
I will touch any one of these
two balls, it doesn't matter

636
00:43:45,986 --> 00:43:48,293
which one, with the
electroscope.

637
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,392
And you will see that there is
charge there.

638
00:43:51,392 --> 00:43:55,573
So I have demonstrated then
that there is an electric field

639
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:59,178
outside that sphere.
Now I will do exactly the same

640
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,845
demonstration,
but now I put these two

641
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:04,891
conducting
balls inside,

642
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:06,929
so here they are.
I touch them,

643
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:10,869
you just have to t- trust me
that I really will touch them,

644
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:15,013
and then I will take them out.
And if I didn't make a mistake,

645
00:44:15,013 --> 00:44:18,953
if I didn't touch the rim by
accident, then I will show you

646
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:22,961
that there is no electric field
inside, it means there is no

647
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:26,222
induction, so these balls did
not pick up charge.

648
00:44:26,222 --> 00:44:29,551
I show you with the
electroscope that indeed there

649
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:34,103
is no charge on it.
So that is the way I want to do

650
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:37,391
this.
So there is the electroscope.

651
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:42,227
Here is the sphere.
And the way I'm going to charge

652
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:46,579
it has a nice name,
it's called electrophorus,

653
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:51,222
hard to pronounce,
I first rub a glass plate with

654
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:54,51
cat fur.
Then I take a metal plate.

655
00:44:54,51 --> 00:44:58,669
I put on top.
And I touch it with my finger.

656
00:44:58,669 --> 00:45:04,472
And now I transfer charge and
you think about it why that is.

657
00:45:04,472 --> 00:45:10,966
I put it on here again,
touch it again with my finger.

658
00:45:10,966 --> 00:45:14,347
I'm again charging it.
Put it on top,

659
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:19,42
touch it again with my finger.
I want a little bit more

660
00:45:19,42 --> 00:45:22,519
charge.
So I'm rubbing this again.

661
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:26,277
Put this on top.
Touch it with my finger.

662
00:45:26,277 --> 00:45:30,222
Every time I do that I feel a
little shock.

663
00:45:30,222 --> 00:45:33,979
Put it on there.
Touch it with my finger.

664
00:45:33,979 --> 00:45:38,018
OK.
Let's hope that's enough.

665
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:40,702
So now comes demonstration
number one.

666
00:45:40,702 --> 00:45:44,329
These two spheres conducting
completely discharged,

667
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:46,723
I bring them close to this
sphere.

668
00:45:46,723 --> 00:45:48,972
There they are.
I separate them.

669
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:51,801
And now they must have picked
up charge.

670
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:56,008
Shall I use this one or this
one to touch the electroscope?

671
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:59,272
The same to me.
My right hand or my left hand,

672
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:01,52
who wants right?
Who wants left?

673
00:46:01,52 --> 00:46:04,567
The right ones have it.
There's the charge.

674
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:08,411
So I've shown you that there is
an

675
00:46:08,411 --> 00:46:12,115
electric field there.
Through induction I have

676
00:46:12,115 --> 00:46:16,311
created charge on here.
Now I'll do the same inside.

677
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:21,167
It's always tricky because if I
hit -- if I hit the rim then

678
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:24,541
it's not zero.
This one has to go in first

679
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:27,174
because the opening is too
small.

680
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:29,972
Then the second one has to come
in.

681
00:46:29,972 --> 00:46:33,346
Now I have to touch them,
and I really do.

682
00:46:33,346 --> 00:46:36,473
I wouldn't cheat on you.
Not this time.

683
00:46:36,473 --> 00:46:41,164
They are now in contact with
each other.

684
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:45,605
And now I take one out.
And I take the other out.

685
00:46:45,605 --> 00:46:50,787
Which one shall I touch it,
there shouldn't be any charge

686
00:46:50,787 --> 00:46:55,414
on either one of them.
We had left before or we had

687
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:58,745
right before?
Well let's do this one.

688
00:46:58,745 --> 00:47:01,059
This one?
Who is for left?

689
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:04,298
Who is for right?
The lefts have it.

690
00:47:04,298 --> 00:47:06,889
Oh.
[laughter] What happened?

691
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:11,886
I must have touched the side.
There's no way around it.

692
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:16,697
I'll make sure that there is
enough

693
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:22,882
charge on it.
I'll charge it once more.

694
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,811
Discharge them.
OK.

695
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:30,368
We'll do it again.
Go inside.

696
00:47:30,368 --> 00:47:34,111
Go inside.
I touch them.

697
00:47:34,111 --> 00:47:38,017
Take it out.
Take it out.

698
00:47:38,017 --> 00:47:40,621
Nothing.
Nothing.

699
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:50,263
Maybe a teeny weeny little bit,
well, the electric field inside

700
00:47:50,263 --> 00:47:54,825
is not necessarily exactly zero.
But it's extremely close.

701
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:59,467
The last thing I want to show
you has to do with the fringe

702
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:04,269
field that we have seen here.
I have here two parallel plates

703
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:09,071
which I'm going to charge with
an instrument that we have not

704
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:12,993
seen before which is called the
uh -- a Wimshurst.

705
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:18,596
If I rotate this crank I can
produce positive and negative

706
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:21,63
charge.
And this plate becomes

707
00:48:21,63 --> 00:48:27,805
positively charged and the other
plate automatically becomes

708
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:32,828
negatively charged.
And I'm going to show this to

709
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:36,176
you right there.
That's the idea.

710
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:38,688
Yeah.
We will make it uh.

711
00:48:38,688 --> 00:48:42,141
So there you see these two
plates.

712
00:48:42,141 --> 00:48:48,106
And you see a Ping Pong ball.
And this Ping Pong ball is a

713
00:48:48,106 --> 00:48:52,496
conductor,
we put conducting paint on it.

714
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,865
And remember when I did the
demonstration with the balloon

715
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:59,293
which bounced between my head
and the VandeGraaff and every

716
00:48:59,293 --> 00:49:02,484
time that it bounced on the
VandeGraaff it took all the

717
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:05,912
charge of the VandeGraaff and
when it bounced on my head it

718
00:49:05,912 --> 00:49:08,572
took my charge,
and so it went back and forth,

719
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:11,704
along the field lines.
And that is what I want to show

720
00:49:11,704 --> 00:49:13,891
you now.
That this Ping Pong ball will

721
00:49:13,891 --> 00:49:17,26
start to probe that field first
outside the capacitor or I

722
00:49:17,26 --> 00:49:21,685
shouldn't use the word capacitor
with these plates,

723
00:49:21,685 --> 00:49:26,502
and then I will bring the Ping
Pong ball inside and then you

724
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:30,258
will see that the field is much
stronger there.

725
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,442
So let's first get some charge
on there.

726
00:49:33,442 --> 00:49:37,85
And listen to the sounds.
Every time that it h- hits it

727
00:49:37,85 --> 00:49:40,789
bangs.
So it's following almost those

728
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:44,3
field lines.
And in doing that it's actually

729
00:49:44,3 --> 00:49:49,035
transferring charge every time
from one plate to the other.

730
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:53,117
It's nicely going around in an
arc

731
00:49:53,117 --> 00:49:57,247
the way you see it there.
So it's clear that there is an

732
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,775
electric field outside.
I've proven that to you.

733
00:50:00,775 --> 00:50:04,004
Otherwise it would never do
what it's doing.

734
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:07,682
So the electric field outside
is not exactly zero,

735
00:50:07,682 --> 00:50:10,836
of course not.
This plate is not infinitely

736
00:50:10,836 --> 00:50:13,538
large.
And now I will bring this Ping

737
00:50:13,538 --> 00:50:16,917
Pong ball inside,
I have to open up the -- the

738
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:19,92
gap a little,
and I will bring it inside.

739
00:50:19,92 --> 00:50:24,063
And you see the field is much
stronger.

740
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:28,657
Now it's going back and forth
between those very high-density

741
00:50:28,657 --> 00:50:31,643
field lines, very strong
electric field,

742
00:50:31,643 --> 00:50:36,313
going back and forth each time
that it hits the plate it c- it

743
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:40,448
changes polarity and this is not
too different from the

744
00:50:40,448 --> 00:50:44,659
experiment I did with the
balloon when I bounced it back

745
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:49,176
from the VandeGraaff to my head
and back to the VandeGraaff.

746
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:51,014
OK.
Start working on that

747
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,924
assignment.
It's not an easy assignment

748
00:50:53,924 --> 50:59
this week.
See you Wednesday.
