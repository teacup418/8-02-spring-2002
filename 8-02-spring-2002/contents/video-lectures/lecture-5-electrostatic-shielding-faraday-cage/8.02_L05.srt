1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05,652



2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:09,78
So today no new concepts,
no new ideas,

3
00:00:09,78 --> 00:00:16,081
you can release a little bit
and I want to discuss with you

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:22,708
the connection between electric
potential and electric fields.

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:29,009
Imagine you have an electric
field here in space and that I

6
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:35,093
take a charge Q in my pocket,
I start at position A and I

7
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:38,941
walk
around and I return at that

8
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,406
point A.
Since these forces are

9
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:45,185
conservative forces,
if the electric field is a

10
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:49,294
static electric field,
there are no moving charges,

11
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:53,484
but that becomes more
difficult, then the forces are

12
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:58,168
conservative forces and so the
work that I do when I march

13
00:00:58,168 --> 00:01:01,947
around and coming back at point
A must be zero.

14
00:01:01,947 --> 00:01:08,109
It's clear when you uh look at
the equation number three that

15
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:13,01
the potential difference
between point A and point A is

16
00:01:13,01 --> 00:01:17,184
obviously zero.
I g- start at point A and I end

17
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:22,447
at point A and that is the
integral in going from A back to

18
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:26,803
point A of E dot DL and that
then has to be zero.

19
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:32,248
And we normally indicate such
an integral with a circle which

20
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:35,333
means you end up where you
started.

21
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:40,778
This is a line now this is not
a closed surface

22
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:45,027
as we had in equation one.
This is a closed line.

23
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:50,074
And so whenever we deal with
static electric fields we can

24
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:53,615
add now another equation if we
like that.

25
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:58,927
And that is if we have a closed
line of E dot DL so we end up

26
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:02,911
where we started that then has
to become zero.

27
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:07,603
Later in the course we will see
that there are special

28
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:12,473
situations where we don't deal
with static

29
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:15,857
fields when we don't have
conservative E fields,

30
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:18,233
that that is not the case
anymore.

31
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,401
But for now it is.
So if we know the electric

32
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:25,865
field everywhere then we -- we
can see equation number two then

33
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:28,169
we know the potential
everywhere.

34
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:32,129
And so if we turn it the other
way around if we knew the

35
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,665
potential everywhere you want to
know what the electric field is

36
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:42,282
and that of course is possible.
If you look at equation two and

37
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:46,195
three you see that the
potential is the integral of the

38
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:49,528
electric field.
So it is obvious that the field

39
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:52,354
must be the derivative of the
potential.

40
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:56,557
Now when you have fields being
derivative of potentials you

41
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:59,963
always have to worry about plus
and minus signs,

42
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:04,238
whether um you have to pay MIT
twenty-seven thousand dollars

43
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:08,152
tuition to be here or whether
MIT pays you twenty-seven

44
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:12,354
thousand dollars tuition for
coming here is

45
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:17,493
only a difference of a minus
sign but it's a big difference

46
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:20,948
of course.
And so let's work this out in

47
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:24,492
some detail.
I have here a charge plus Q.

48
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:29,277
And at a distance R at that
location P we know what the

49
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:33,086
electric field is,
we've done that a zillion

50
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:36,276
times.
This is the unit vector in the

51
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:41,503
direction from Q to that point
and we know that the electric

52
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:46,288
field is pointing away from that
charge

53
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:52,433
and we know that the electric
field E we have seen that

54
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:59,375
already the first lecture is Q
divided by four pi epsilon zero

55
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:03,472
R squared in the direction of R
roof.

56
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:09,958
And last lecture we derived
what the electric potential is

57
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:14,965
at that location.
The electric potential is Q

58
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:20,086
divided by four pi epsilon zero
R.

59
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:23,895
This is a vector.
This is a scalar.

60
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:30,168
So the um potential is the
integral of the electric field

61
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:36,888
along a line and now I want to
try whether the electric field

62
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:42,377
can be written as the derivative
of the potential.

63
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:47,53
So let us take DV DR and let's
see what we get.

64
00:04:47,53 --> 00:04:53,578
If I take this DV DR I get a
minus Q divided by four pi

65
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:57,106
epsilon
zero R squared.

66
00:04:57,106 --> 00:05:01,826
Of course if I want to know
what the electric field is I

67
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:07,233
need a vector so I will multiply
both sides, which is completely

68
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:12,468
legal, there's nothing illegal
about that, with unit vector in

69
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:16,501
the direction R so that turns
them into vectors.

70
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:21,822
And now you see that I'm almost
there, this is almost the same,

71
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:26,285
except for a minus sign.
And so the derivative of the

72
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,031
potential is minus E,
not plus E.

73
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:33,447
And so I will write
that down here,

74
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:38,719
that E equals minus DV DR.
So they are closely related if

75
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:44,556
you know what the -- oh I want
-- I want this to be a vector so

76
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:48,51
I put here R roof.
Vector on the left side,

77
00:05:48,51 --> 00:05:52,275
you must have a vector on the
right side.

78
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:57,171
And so if you know the
potential everywhere in space,

79
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:02,161
then you can retrieve the
electric field.

80
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:06,581
I mentioned last time that the
electric field vectors -- e-

81
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:10,544
electric field lines,
are always perpendicular to the

82
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:14,659
equipotential surfaces.
And that's obvious why that has

83
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:18,012
to be the case.
Imagine that you are in an --

84
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:22,128
in space and that you move with
a charge in your pocket

85
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:24,948
perpendicular to electric field
lines.

86
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:29,292
So you purposely move only
perpendicular to electric field

87
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:32,112
lines.
So that means that the force on

88
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:37,107
you and the direction in which
you move are always at

89
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:39,677
ninety-degree angles.
So you'll only move

90
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:41,733
perpendicular to the field
lines.

91
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,624
These are the field lines,
you move like this.

92
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:47,515
These are the field lines,
you move like this.

93
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:51,112
So you never do any work.
Because the dot product between

94
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:54,839
DL and E is zero and if you
don't do any work the potential

95
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,344
remains the same,
that's the definition.

96
00:06:57,344 --> 00:07:00,878
And so you can see that
therefore equipotential surfaces

97
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,925
must always be perpendicular to
field lines and field lines must

98
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:09,233
always be perpendicular to the
equipotentials.

99
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:12,592
And I will show you again the
-- the viewgraph,

100
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:16,755
the overhead projection of uh
the nice drawing by Maxwell.

101
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:20,406
With the plus four charge and
the minus one charge.

102
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:24,642
The same one we saw last time.
Only to point out again this

103
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:27,928
ninety-degree angle.
I discussed this in great

104
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:30,922
detail last lecture so I will
not do that.

105
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:33,551
R- the red lines are really
surfaces.

106
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:37,494
This is three-dimensional,
you have to rotate the whole

107
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:41,903
thing about the vertical.
So these are surfaces.

108
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:45,364
And the red ones are positive
potential surfaces and the blue

109
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,44
ones are negative potential
surfaces.

110
00:07:47,44 --> 00:07:50,381
That is not important.
But the green lines are field

111
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:52,111
lines.
And notice if I take for

112
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:55,283
instance this field line,
it's perpendicular here to the

113
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:57,878
red, perpendicular there,
perpendicular there,

114
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,128
perpendicular there.
Perpendicular here.

115
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:02,088
Perpendicular here.
Coming in here,

116
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:03,703
perpendicular,
perpendicular,

117
00:08:03,703 --> 00:08:06,125
perpendicular.
Everywhere where you look on

118
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,816
this graph you will see that the
field lines are perpendicular to

119
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:12,517
the
equipotentials.

120
00:08:12,517 --> 00:08:16,328
And that is something that we
now fully understand.

121
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:20,902
The situation means then that
if you release a charge at zero

122
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:25,4
speed that it would always start
to move perpendicular to an

123
00:08:25,4 --> 00:08:29,974
equipotential surface because it
always starts to move in the

124
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:34,243
direction of a field line,
a plus charge in the direction

125
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:37,749
of the field line,
minus charge in the opposite

126
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:40,722
direction.
So if you're in space and you

127
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:45,754
release a charge at zero speed
it always takes off

128
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:48,489
perpendicular to
equipotentials.

129
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:51,93
You have something similar with
gravity.

130
00:08:51,93 --> 00:08:55,018
If you look at maps of
mountaineers,

131
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:58,547
contours of equal altitude,
equal height,

132
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:03,047
if you started skiing and you
started at that point,

133
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:08,076
and you started with zero
speed, you would always take off

134
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:11,164
perpendicular to the
equipotentials.

135
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:15,399
So this is the direction in
which

136
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,437
you start to move.
If you start off with zero

137
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:22,465
speed.
I now want to give you some

138
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:28,154
deeper feeling of the connection
between potential and electric

139
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:32,467
fields and I want you to follow
me very closely.

140
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:36,597
Each step that I make I want
you to follow me.

141
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:41,735
So imagine that I am somewhere
in space at p- position P.

142
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:48,618
At that position P there is a
potential, one unique potential,

143
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:50,591
V of P.
That's a given.

144
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,795
And there is an electric field
at that location where I am.

145
00:09:55,795 --> 00:10:01,088
And now what I'm going to do,
I'm going to make an extremely

146
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:04,138
small step only in the X
direction.

147
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:07,996
Not in Y, not in Z.
Only in the X direction.

148
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:13,378
If I measure no change in the
potential over that little step

149
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:18,313
it means that the component of
the electric field in the

150
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:24,732
direction X is zero.
If I do measure a difference in

151
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:31,08
potential then the component,
the X component of the electric

152
00:10:31,08 --> 00:10:37,216
field, the magnitude of that,
would be that little sidestep

153
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:41,554
that I have made,
delta X, it would be the

154
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:47,584
potential difference that I
measure divided by that little

155
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:52,663
sidestep.
And I keep Y and Z constant.

156
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:57,109
And these are magnitudes.
But that's why I put these

157
00:10:57,109 --> 00:11:00,945
vertical bars here.
Equally if I made a small

158
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:05,566
sidestep in the Y direction and
I measured a potential

159
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:10,972
difference delta V keeping X and
Z constant, that would then be

160
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:15,68
the component of the electric
field in the Y direction.

161
00:11:15,68 --> 00:11:20,301
Earlier we wrote down for E as
a unit new- newtons per

162
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:23,527
coulombs.
From now on we almost always

163
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:27,243
will
write down for the unit of

164
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:32,155
electric field volts per meter.
It is exactly the same thing as

165
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:35,72
newtons over coulombs,
there is no difference,

166
00:11:35,72 --> 00:11:39,206
but this gives you a little bit
more insight.

167
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:43,959
You make a little sidestep in
meters and you measure how much

168
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,444
the potential changes,
it's volts per meters.

169
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:50,613
It is a potential change over a
distance.

170
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:56,08
So now I can write down the
connection between electric

171
00:11:56,08 --> 00:12:01,104
field and potential in
Cartesian coordinates.

172
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:07,956
It looks much more scary than
the nice way that I could write

173
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:13,209
it down up there.
When I had only a function of

174
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:18,005
distance R.
And so in Cartesian coordinates

175
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:24,514
we now get E equals minus,
that minus sign we discussed at

176
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:31,251
length, and now we get DV DX
times X roof plus DV DY times Y

177
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,946
roof plus
DV DZ times Z roof.

178
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:40,886
And what you see here,
this first term here,

179
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:46,63
including of course the minus
sign, that is E of X.

180
00:12:46,63 --> 00:12:52,834
And this term including the
minus sign, that is E of Y.

181
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:57,544
And so on.
And the fact that you see these

182
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:03,173
curled Ds it means partial
derivatives.

183
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:07,39
That means when you do this
derivative you keep Z and Y

184
00:13:07,39 --> 00:13:10,513
constant.
When you do this derivative you

185
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:15,042
do X and Z constant and so on.
And so this is the Cartesian

186
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:19,727
notation for which in eighteen
oh two you will learn or maybe

187
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:24,255
you already have learned we
would write this E equals minus

188
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:27,691
the gradient of G.
This is a vector function.

189
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:31,517
This is a scalar function.
And this is just a s- a

190
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:36,046
different notation,
just a matter of words,

191
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:42,517
for this mathematical recipe.
And you'll get that with

192
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:49,356
eighteen in eighteen oh two if
you haven't seen that yet.

193
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:56,438
So I now want a straightforward
example whereby we assume a

194
00:13:56,438 --> 00:14:03,643
certain dependence on X and I
give you it is a given that V,

195
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:08,894
the potential,
is ten to the fifth

196
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:11,946
times X.
So that is a given.

197
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:18,729
And this holds between X equals
zero and say ten to the minus

198
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:23,477
two meters.
So it holds over a space of one

199
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:27,434
centimeter.
So the potential changes

200
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:33,538
linearly with distance.
What now is the electric field?

201
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:38,399
In that space?
Well, the electric field I go

202
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:46,276
back to my description there.
There's only a component in the

203
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:50,616
X direction.
So the first derivative becomes

204
00:14:50,616 --> 00:14:56,57
minus ten to the fifth times X
roof and the others are zero.

205
00:14:56,57 --> 00:15:02,423
So EY is zero and EZ is zero.
So you may say well yeah whoa

206
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:06,965
nice mathematics but we don't
see any physics.

207
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:10,598
This is more physical than you
think.

208
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:15,038
Imagine that I have here a
plate

209
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:19,22
which is charged,
it's positive charge.

210
00:15:19,22 --> 00:15:25,823
And the plate is at location X
and I have another plate here,

211
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:31,985
it's say at location zero.
I call this plate A and I call

212
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:37,377
this plate B and this plate is
charged negatively.

213
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:45,191
So X goes into this direction.
So I can put the electric field

214
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:50,193
inside here according to the
recipe minus ten to the fifth

215
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:55,459
and it is in the direction of
minus X roof so e- X roof is in

216
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,233
this direction,
the electric field is in the

217
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:03,358
opposite direction,
and it's the same everywhere

218
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:07,22
and that is very physical.
We discussed that.

219
00:16:07,22 --> 00:16:12,398
When we discussed the electric
field near very large planes,

220
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:16,698
that the electric field inside
was a

221
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:20,183
constant, remember,
and the electric field inside

222
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:24,249
was sigma divided by epsilon
zero if sigma is the surface

223
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,008
charge density on each of these
plates.

224
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:31,582
And we argued that the electric
field outside was about zero and

225
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:35,285
that the electric field outside
here was about zero.

226
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:39,278
So it's extremely physical.
This is exactly what you see

227
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,892
here.
The electric field minus ten to

228
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:47,192
the fifth times e- so the
magnitude of this electric field

229
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:53,658
here, the magnitude,
is ten to the fifth volts per

230
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:57,749
meter.
What now is the potential

231
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:03,028
difference?
Well, VA minus VB minus VB is

232
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:08,966
the integral in going from A to
B of E dot DL.

233
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:17,148
Well I go from here to here so
I write down for DL I wrote down

234
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:24,01
DX of course.
Because I called that the X

235
00:17:24,01 --> 00:17:28,471
direction now.
So I will write down here dot

236
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:31,997
DX.
And so this is minus ten to the

237
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:38,013
fifth times the integral in
going from A to B of X roof dot

238
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:40,814
DX.
It looks scary but it is

239
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:46,622
trivial, the X roof is the unit
vector in this direction.

240
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:51,394
And DX is a little vector DX in
this direction.

241
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:56,677
So they're both in the same
direction.

242
00:17:56,677 --> 00:18:01,442
So the cosine,
the angle between the two is

243
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:05,299
one.
So I can forget about vectors,

244
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:11,652
I can forget about the dot.
And so this becomes minus ten

245
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:18,572
to the fifth times the integral
in going from A to B of DX and

246
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:23,791
that is trivial.
That is minus ten to the fifth

247
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:29,956
times the location.
I have to do the integral

248
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:34,936
between A and B.
So I get here X of B minus X of

249
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:38,433
A.
And if this is ten to the minus

250
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:44,048
two meters, to go from here to
here is one centimeter,

251
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:48,71
I must multiply this by ten to
the minus two,

252
00:18:48,71 --> 00:18:53,584
so I get that this is minus one
thousand volts.

253
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:57,504
So A is a thousand volts lower
than B.

254
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:03,31
That's what it means.
And that's something that's

255
00:19:03,31 --> 00:19:06,806
very physical.
Notice that if you go from left

256
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:10,068
to right that the potential
grows linearly,

257
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:14,03
this is lower than that,
and if you in your head use

258
00:19:14,03 --> 00:19:17,526
planes like this parallel to the
other planes,

259
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:21,255
each one of those planes would
be equipotentials,

260
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:24,285
they everywhere have the same
potential.

261
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:28,79
And gradually when you move it
up your potential increases,

262
00:19:28,79 --> 00:19:32,674
but notice the electric field
goes

263
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:35,981
from plus to minus in the
opposite direction.

264
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:40,64
That's always the reason that's
behind that -- that minus sign.

265
00:19:40,64 --> 00:19:45,148
Well clearly I'm always free to
choose where I choose my zero

266
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,004
potential.
We discussed that last time.

267
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:51,836
You don't always have to choose
infinitely far zero.

268
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:55,142
So I could choose this
arbitrarily to be zero

269
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:57,772
potential.
This would then be plus a

270
00:19:57,772 --> 00:20:00,628
thousand.
And so you then find that the

271
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:05,813
potential V is then simply ten
to the fifth times X,

272
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:10,287
when X is zero you find the
potential to be zero,

273
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:15,694
and when X is one centimeter
you find the potential to be a

274
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:21,194
thousand volts and that then
goes together with the electric

275
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:26,135
field equals minus ten to the
fifth in this direction.

276
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:29,212
And so this is extremely
physical.

277
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:34,619
This is something that you
would have whenever we deal with

278
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:38,721
parallel plates.
As long as there's no charge

279
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:42,773
moving,
and we're dealing with solid

280
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,991
conductors, so we have static
electric fields,

281
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:49,995
the charges are not heavily
moving, then the field inside

282
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:54,285
the conductor is always zero.
Not the case in a nonconductor.

283
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:58,003
It's only in a conductor
because conductors have free

284
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:02,078
electrons to move and if these
free electrons see electric

285
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:06,154
fields inside which they may
they start to move until they

286
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:10,372
experience no longer a force,
thereby they kill the electric

287
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:12,524
field
inside.

288
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:18,098
So the charge in a conductor
always rearranges itself so that

289
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:23,951
the electric field becomes zero.
If the field is a static field,

290
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:28,596
not rapidly changing.
And so now I want to evaluate

291
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:33,612
with you the situation that I'm
going to charge a solid

292
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:39,001
conductor and ask myself the
question where does the charge

293
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:42,066
go.
In honor of um Valentine's Day

294
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:46,726
let's take a solid heart,
steel heart,

295
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:49,575
it's solid all the way
throughout.

296
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:54,497
So this is a solid conductor
and I bring on this conductor

297
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:57,779
charge from the outside.
Plus or minus,

298
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:02,701
let's just take plus for now.
And so the question that I'm

299
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:05,723
asking you now,
this is a conductor,

300
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:10,213
this is not an insulator,
the story for insulators is

301
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:15,653
totally different,
this has free moving electrons

302
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:20,861
inside, I'm asking you now if I
touch this conducting heart --

303
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:25,897
by the way, your heart is a very
good conductor -- um if you

304
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:30,848
touch this conducting heart
where would this charge end up?

305
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:34,86
Where would it go to?
And I leave you with three

306
00:22:34,86 --> 00:22:38,104
choices.
And we'll have a vote on that.

307
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:42,884
The first choice is that the
plus charges would uniformly

308
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:47,493
distribute for throughout.
A possibility.

309
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:50,244
The second possibility,
less likely,

310
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:54,565
I think, that all the charge
will go to one place there.

311
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:58,416
I don't know which place that
would be, but maybe.

312
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:03,052
And then the third possibility
is that maybe the charge will

313
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:07,845
uniformly distribute itself only
on the outer surface and then

314
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,224
the fourth possibility is none
of the above.

315
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,288
All these suggestions I made
were wrong.

316
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:19,6
Who think that the charge
might uniformly distribute it

317
00:23:19,6 --> 00:23:23,189
throughout the conductor?
I see one or two hands.

318
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:26,255
That's good.
Don't feel ashamed of raising

319
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:29,396
your hands, in the worst case
you're wrong,

320
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:33,209
I've been so many times wrong
when it comes to this.

321
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:37,471
Don't feel bad about that.
Who thinks that the charge will

322
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:39,864
all go to one point in the
heart?

323
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:43,453
You have the courage?
You think it will go to one

324
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,772
point?
Charge repels each other,

325
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:49,634
right, so
that doesn't seem likely.

326
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:53,541
Who thinks that it will
uniformly distribute itself on

327
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:57,007
the outer surface?
Who thinks none of the above?

328
00:23:57,007 --> 00:23:59,956
Very good.
Well, those who suggested that

329
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:04,158
it might be uniform on the
outside I would still give them

330
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:07,181
a B but it's not uniform,
as you will see.

331
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:10,204
But it will go exclusively to
the outside.

332
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,564
And I will prove that now to
you.

333
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:18,019
Let us first look for that
ridiculous possibility that the

334
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:21,602
charge would somehow end up in
the conductor itself.

335
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:25,536
I take here a Gaussian surface
which is a closed surface.

336
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:29,681
I know inside the conductor if
we have electrostatic fields,

337
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:33,193
not fastly moving charges,
but it's a static field,

338
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:36,916
I know that the E field
everywhere must be zero on the

339
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:40,71
surface, this is a closed
surface, so the integral of E

340
00:24:40,71 --> 00:24:44,855
dot DA equation one is zero.
That means the charge inside my

341
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:49,351
sphere is zero and so there
cannot be any charge.

342
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:53,11
So Gauss's law immediately
kills the possibility that there

343
00:24:53,11 --> 00:24:55,767
would be any charge inside this
conductor.

344
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:59,526
So that's out of the question.
So that leaves you only with

345
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:02,378
one choice, that is on the -- at
the surface.

346
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:04,711
So the charge must be at the
surface.

347
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:08,276
And later in a later lecture I
will discuss with you the

348
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:11,646
details why that charge is not
uniformly distributed.

349
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:14,887
It would be uniformly
distributed at the surface if

350
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,933
this were a sphere.
But not if it has this funny

351
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,917
shape.
But it will be at the surface.

352
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:26,092
Now I'm going to make this
heart a very special heart,

353
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:29,085
more like a real heart,
it's open here,

354
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:32,63
but it is solid here,
so this is a conducting,

355
00:25:32,63 --> 00:25:35,466
the heart muscle,
and here it's open,

356
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:39,405
there's nothing here.
And again I'm going to charge

357
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,847
it.
Bring charge on the outside.

358
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:46,337
So now it's obvious that we
don't expect that there is any

359
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,488
charge that will be inside the
conductor.

360
00:25:49,488 --> 00:25:53,347
That's clear,
the same argument

361
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:55,856
holds with the Gauss's law
argument.

362
00:25:55,856 --> 00:26:00,298
But now is it perhaps possible
that some of the positive charge

363
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,669
will go on the inside of this
surface and some on the outside?

364
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:08,396
Who thinks that maybe some will
now go on the inside,

365
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:11,62
because now the situation is
different, right,

366
00:26:11,62 --> 00:26:14,558
there is now,
it's now a hollow conductor.

367
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,571
Anyone in favor of some of that
charge maybe going on the

368
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:20,147
inside?
I see one hand,

369
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:24,304
two hands, who says no it's not
possible,

370
00:26:24,304 --> 00:26:27,595
it will not go to the inside?
It will still go to the

371
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:29,748
outside.
Well, most of you are very

372
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:32,47
careful now, you don't want to
vote anymore.

373
00:26:32,47 --> 00:26:35,698
It cannot go to the inside.
Why can it not go to the

374
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:37,977
inside?
Let this be my Gauss surface.

375
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:39,94
Closed surface.
Think of this as

376
00:26:39,94 --> 00:26:42,788
three-dimensional.
Everywhere on that line the

377
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:46,46
electric field is zero because
you're inside the conductor.

378
00:26:46,46 --> 00:26:48,739
So the surface integral is also
zero.

379
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:52,348
So Gauss's law says there
cannot be any charge inside that

380
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:54,5
box.
And so again the charge has to

381
00:26:54,5 --> 00:26:57,733
go
to the outer surface and

382
00:26:57,733 --> 00:27:00,208
nothing will go to the inner
surface.

383
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:04,334
And so the conclusion then is
that the electric field is zero

384
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:08,048
in the conductor but the
electric field is also zero in

385
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:11,073
this opening.
There's never any charge there.

386
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:14,374
And so the whole heart
including the cavity is an

387
00:27:14,374 --> 00:27:17,193
equipotential.
There is never any electric

388
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:19,944
field anywhere.
The only electric field's

389
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:23,176
outside the heart.
And there are field lines and

390
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:27,508
these field lines everywhere are
perpendicular to the surface of

391
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:31,974
the
heart because the heart is an

392
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:35,953
equipotential.
So here you get very funny

393
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:41,822
field lines that go like this.
They have to be perpendicular

394
00:27:41,822 --> 00:27:45,701
locally where they reach the
heart wall.

395
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:51,669
Earlier in my lectures I showed
that a uniformly solid sphere

396
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:57,737
has electric field zero inside
and I even showed to you that a

397
00:27:57,737 --> 00:28:02,711
hollow conducting sphere also
has zero

398
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:06,697
electric field inside.
Today I have demonstrated that

399
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:10,915
it doesn't have to be a sphere.
You don't need spherical

400
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:13,751
symmetry.
That any shape provided that

401
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:17,508
it's a hollow conductor,
it has to be a conductor,

402
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:21,802
any shape will give you an
electric field of zero inside.

403
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:24,562
And I first want to demonstrate
that.

404
00:28:24,562 --> 00:28:27,783
I have here something that is
not a sphere.

405
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:31,233
It's a paint can.
It has some aluminum on top.

406
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:35,067
It has an opening there.
It's not

407
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:37,627
perfect.
It's not really closed like

408
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:40,261
this is.
So the electric field inside

409
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:43,993
will not be exactly zero.
But it will be very close.

410
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:47,432
I must have an opening because
I want to get in.

411
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:51,236
I want to get charge,
see whether there is any charge

412
00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:54,017
on the inside.
So I must be able to get

413
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:56,87
through.
So I'm going to charge this one

414
00:28:56,87 --> 00:29:01,333
and then I will take some charge
off the outside and take some

415
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:07,114
charge off the inside and use
the electroscope and see whether

416
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:11,882
we can demonstrate that indeed
there is charge on the outside

417
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:14,584
but there is nothing on the
inside.

418
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:18,876
I will use the same method that
I used last time when I

419
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:22,293
challenged you to figure out how
this works.

420
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:26,903
This is this crazy method which
we call electrophorus elec-

421
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:30,241
electrophorus,
it's difficult to pronounce.

422
00:29:30,241 --> 00:29:33,499
Electrophorus.
We have here a glass plate.

423
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:36,917
I rub it with cat fur.
Think about it again.

424
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:41,079
It's a
little problem inside the

425
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,947
problem.
Metal plate.

426
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,469
I put it on top.
I touch it.

427
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:48,271
I get a shock.
I touch it here.

428
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:51,727
I touch it again.
I get again a shock.

429
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:55,276
And I charge this up.
I touch it again.

430
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:59,105
I get another shock.
And I touch it again.

431
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:02,187
Let's get a little bit more on
it.

432
00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:08,164
The charge on this plate is
positive by the way.

433
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:12,472
That I create on the glass.
I touch it.

434
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:17,459
The charge on here is negative.
Not positive.

435
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:20,293
Put it on again.
Touch it.

436
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:23,466
OK.
So I should have negative

437
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:28,794
charge on there now.
Here is little test sphere.

438
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:34,121
It's a conductor.
I'll take some charge off from

439
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,274
this side.
Touch it.

440
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:40,241
Boy.
There's charge.

441
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:42,685
There's no question.
We agree, right?

442
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:43,907
There's charge.
OK.

443
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:47,438
Now I touch the inside,
let's hope that no sparks fly

444
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:48,524
over.
I touch it.

445
00:30:48,524 --> 00:30:49,678
Nothing.
See that?

446
00:30:49,678 --> 00:30:52,868
Absolutely nothing.
So there's no charge inside,

447
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:56,399
the charge is on the outside.
Which is what I've just

448
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,386
demonstrated.
You see it in front of your own

449
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:01,49
eyes.
All the charge goes to the

450
00:31:01,49 --> 00:31:03,595
outside.
Not so intuitive but an

451
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,6
immediate consequence of the
fact that it's a conductor that

452
00:31:07,6 --> 00:31:12,624
the electrons will move freely
so that the electric

453
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:17,427
field in the conductor itself
is zero and we have argued that

454
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:21,429
no charge can ever go on the
inside of the surface.

455
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:25,752
It all stays on the outside.
So when I touch the inside

456
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:29,355
there was no charge.
So if you are inside that

457
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:33,037
conductor, if your house is a
conducting house,

458
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:37,68
and someone in the outside
world charges your house up when

459
00:31:37,68 --> 00:31:41,203
you're inside,
you have no knowledge of that.

460
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:44,665
It's quite amazing,
isn't it?

461
00:31:44,665 --> 00:31:48,941
You are electrically shielded
from the outside world.

462
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:53,628
Now I'm going to make the
situation even more complicated.

463
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:58,48
I now take a conducting object,
doesn't have to be a sphere.

464
00:31:58,48 --> 00:32:03,003
And I bring that conducting
object hollow in an external

465
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:06,621
electric field.
So someone outside your house

466
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:11,062
is turning on a VandeGraaff
creating an electric field.

467
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:16,316
What now is going to happen?
Well, due to induction,

468
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:21,091
you're going to get some charge
polarization in the conductor.

469
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:25,553
One side may end up negative
and the other side may end up

470
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:28,685
positive.
But what happens on the inside?

471
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:31,268
Nothing.
The electric field in the

472
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:36,044
conductor must stay everywhere
zero if it is a static electric

473
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:38,705
field.
And so no charge will -- can

474
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:43,246
accumulate here and no charge
can accumulate on the inside.

475
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:47,082
And so as you bring this
electric

476
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:51,73
field on the outside you may
get negative and positive charge

477
00:32:51,73 --> 00:32:54,675
on the outside,
maybe negative here and

478
00:32:54,675 --> 00:32:57,309
positive there,
but inside nothing.

479
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,803
You are inside electrically
shielded from the outside world

480
00:33:01,803 --> 00:33:06,374
in the same way that you were
when someone was trying to put

481
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:10,326
charge onto your house,
now someone is trying to zap

482
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:14,355
you with electric fields,
nothing will happen inside.

483
00:33:14,355 --> 00:33:18,98
You will never see an electric
field inside.

484
00:33:18,98 --> 00:33:23,97
I will show you a interesting
drawing, interesting figure,

485
00:33:23,97 --> 00:33:27,298
which is a conducting box.
It's closed.

486
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:32,551
The cup that you see open is
just to allow you to look inside

487
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:37,717
but it is closed from all sides.
And there are some negative

488
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:42,007
charges here and there are
positive charges in the

489
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:48,398
foreground which you don't see.
The red field lines come from

490
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,073
positive charges,
end up on the box,

491
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:55,583
and the negative field lines go
from the box to the negative

492
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:58,334
charges.
There is clear polarization.

493
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:02,538
The box itself is neutral.
I started with a neutral box.

494
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:06,588
But because of this electric
field I get polarization.

495
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:10,028
I end up with negative charge
on the box here,

496
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:13,543
only on the outside,
positive charge on the box

497
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:17,823
here, only on the outside.
Inside electric field is zero.

498
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:23,141
No charge anywhere inside.
Due to this crazy electric

499
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:27,83
field the free moving charges in
the conductor will rearrange

500
00:34:27,83 --> 00:34:32,128
themselves in such a way that
the electric field is zero

501
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:36,348
everywhere in the conductor,
is zero inside the cavity,

502
00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:40,411
and that the closed loop
integral of E dot DL is zero

503
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,303
everywhere if these are static
fields.

504
00:34:43,303 --> 00:34:47,679
And it is clearly impossible
for us to ever calculate how

505
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,289
that charge configuration at the
surface will

506
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:55,786
have to be in order to meet all
those conditions.

507
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:58,335
But nature can do this
effortlessly.

508
00:34:58,335 --> 00:35:02,341
And it can do it extremely
fast, obeying all the laws of

509
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:04,745
physics.
It puts very quickly plus

510
00:35:04,745 --> 00:35:07,221
charge here and minus charge
there.

511
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:11,082
Make sure that there is no
charge on the inside of the

512
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:13,922
surface.
It makes sure that the electric

513
00:35:13,922 --> 00:35:18,511
field is everywhere zero inside
and in the box and it also makes

514
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:24,119
sure that the integral E dot DL
is zero everywhere in space.

515
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,695
And therefore the box and
everything inside becomes an

516
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:31,204
equipotential so it also
arranges matters so that the

517
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:34,645
field lines wherever they
intersect with the box are

518
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:38,558
always perpendicular to the box.
And all of that is done in

519
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:42,539
almost no time at all by nature.
It is an amazing thing that

520
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,587
this happens and something that
as I said would be impossible

521
00:35:46,587 --> 00:35:50,298
for us to calculate because the
field configurations are

522
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:53,807
extraordinarily difficult.
So if you were inside this

523
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:57,181
metal box, no matter what
happens

524
00:35:57,181 --> 00:36:00,325
on the outside,
you would be electrically

525
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:05,278
isolated from the outside world.
You would not notice that there

526
00:36:05,278 --> 00:36:09,601
is a strong electric field
outside, nor would you notice

527
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,218
that people are trying to charge
up your house.

528
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:17,463
We call that electrostatic
shielding and we give that a

529
00:36:17,463 --> 00:36:21,865
name, that house of yours would
be called a Faraday cage.

530
00:36:21,865 --> 00:36:25,403
It's called after the great
physicist Faraday.

531
00:36:25,403 --> 00:36:30,905
You will learn a lot more about
him during this course.

532
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:34,813
Before I demonstrate this I
want to address an issue which

533
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:38,926
is related to problem two-one.
Which is your next assignment.

534
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:42,285
And I want to urge you,
I make myself no illusion,

535
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:46,536
but I want to urge you to start
working on that assignment this

536
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:50,169
weekend, not next week.
These assignments are not just

537
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:53,323
baby assignments.
These are MIT assignments and

538
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:57,642
you got to put in a lot of work
to do them, so please start this

539
00:36:57,642 --> 00:37:02,715
weekend not to do me a favor but
to do yourself that favor.

540
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:05,596
But let's talk about problem
two-one.

541
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:10,078
In other words I will help you
with that problem two-one.

542
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:15,04
I said several times that it is
not possible to get an electric

543
00:37:15,04 --> 00:37:19,922
field inside a hollow conductor.
Well, suppose I go inside the

544
00:37:19,922 --> 00:37:22,164
conductor.
I go inside there.

545
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:25,365
And I put sneakily a charge in
my pocket.

546
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:28,486
And I sit inside there and you
close it.

547
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:32,969
Then there is a charge inside,
there's nothing you can do

548
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:37,009
about it.
And if there is a charge

549
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:39,785
inside, there is an electric
field.

550
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:44,846
So now we have a situation and
since it is post Valentine's Day

551
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:48,112
my heart has evolved into a
sphere again.

552
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:51,623
So now we take a spherical
conductor, solid,

553
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:55,95
this is solid material,
and somehow I'm sitting inside

554
00:37:55,95 --> 00:38:00,44
here with a charge plus Q.
Can make it minus if you want

555
00:38:00,44 --> 00:38:02,807
to.
That's exactly the problem

556
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:06,563
two-one is about.
Now clearly there is positive

557
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:11,84
charge inside.
So clearly there has to be an

558
00:38:11,84 --> 00:38:15,883
electric field.
But the electric field inside

559
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:19,834
the conductor,
that means the electric field

560
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,315
anywhere here,
must be zero.

561
00:38:22,315 --> 00:38:27,645
If it's not zero the electrons
will keep moving until it is

562
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:30,493
zero.
So the conducting material

563
00:38:30,493 --> 00:38:35,731
itself has no electric field.
What does that mean now with

564
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:41,061
respect to any charge on the
inside surface?

565
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:44,563
Now there must be charge on the
inside surface.

566
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:48,066
Because now if I made this my
Gaussian surface,

567
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:51,874
which is now a spherical
surface, a closed surface,

568
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:54,083
Mr.
Gauss says that the closed

569
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:58,499
surface integral of E dot DA
over this surface must be zero

570
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:01,774
because the electric field is
zero anywhere.

571
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:06,191
That's the same as all the
charge inside divided by epsilon

572
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:08,704
zero.
So this -- the charge inside

573
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:12,054
must be zero.
Since there can be no charge in

574
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:17,007
the conductor itself,
negative charge must now

575
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:20,184
accumulate on the inside of that
surface.

576
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:24,156
So that the net charge inside
this surface is zero.

577
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:28,922
So now we do get charge on the
inside, and how much charge do

578
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:31,941
you get on the inside?
Exactly minus Q.

579
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:34,641
So that the sum of the two is
zero.

580
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:37,898
Now this conductor originally
was neutral.

581
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:41,949
It had no net charge.
So therefore on the surface of

582
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:45,365
the conductor we must now see
charge plus Q.

583
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:50,909
Because the minus charge on
the inside came from the

584
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:55,259
induct- conductor itself,
and so the sum must be zero.

585
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:59,937
So now you get a peculiar
situation that the plus Q charge

586
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:04,944
inside which creates an E field
inside creates negative charge

587
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,899
on the inside,
the same in magnitude,

588
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:11,264
opposite in sign,
and plus Q charge on the

589
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,89
outside.
And the electric fields,

590
00:40:13,89 --> 00:40:17,583
they're very complicated.
The electric fields,

591
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:22,735
let me try to put them in,
I would imagine that if this

592
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:26,206
charge Q is closer to this wall
than to this wall that the

593
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:29,677
negative charge here will be
larger in density than there.

594
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,565
It's really an induction
effect.

595
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:34,244
The negative charge wants to go
to this plus.

596
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:37,775
That's really what's happening.
And so since this charge is

597
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:41,611
closer to this wall than to that
wall it will be able to attract

598
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:45,447
more electrons and so it's clear
that the density of charge here

599
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:48,857
should be higher than there and
so the field lines always

600
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:52,085
perpendicular to the
equipotential,

601
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:56,268
so they must be always
perpendicular to the wall,

602
00:40:56,268 --> 00:41:00,451
sort of like this.
So I put in a few field lines.

603
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:04,46
But here the field will be
stronger than there.

604
00:41:04,46 --> 00:41:08,73
So there is a field inside.
What now is the charge

605
00:41:08,73 --> 00:41:13,524
distribution on the outside?
That is the hardest of all.

606
00:41:13,524 --> 00:41:18,578
And by no means so obvious.
It turns out that the charge on

607
00:41:18,578 --> 00:41:23,475
the outside on this sphere,
because it is a sphere,

608
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:27,156
will be uniformly distributed.
And it is not intuitive and it

609
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:29,794
is not obvious.
Nature must obey all laws of

610
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:32,002
physics.
The conductor must become an

611
00:41:32,002 --> 00:41:34,701
equipotential.
There can be no electric field

612
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:37,891
inside the conductor.
Electric field lines have to be

613
00:41:37,891 --> 00:41:40,284
everywhere perpendicular to the
surface.

614
00:41:40,284 --> 00:41:43,964
The closed loop integral of E
dot DL must be zero everywhere.

615
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:47,399
And the only way that nature
can do that is by making the

616
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:49,976
charge distribution on the
surface uniform.

617
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:53,289
And that is amazing when you
think

618
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:55,47
of that.
It's independent of the

619
00:41:55,47 --> 00:41:58,074
position of that charge plus Q
inside.

620
00:41:58,074 --> 00:42:02,367
So if you start to move around
with that charge plus Q inside,

621
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,549
the outside world will not
know.

622
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:08,561
The outside world only knows
that there is a charge plus Q

623
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:12,713
uniformly distributed on the
outside because it is a sphere.

624
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:15,88
That would not be the case if
it were a heart.

625
00:42:15,88 --> 00:42:19,751
But the outside world has no
way of knowing that you are

626
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:23,269
moving that charge inside
around.

627
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:26,981
So I'm sitting inside there and
suppose I crawl inside there

628
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,994
with a rubber rod and with a
cat.

629
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:32,516
And I use the rubber rod on the
cat creating positive and

630
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,277
negative charge,
same amount.

631
00:42:34,277 --> 00:42:37,863
The outside world will not know
because I don't change the

632
00:42:37,863 --> 00:42:40,505
charge inside.
Only if there's plus Q in my

633
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:42,832
pocket.
The fact that I create plus on

634
00:42:42,832 --> 00:42:46,355
the cat and maybe minus on
myself, the outside world will

635
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,626
never know because the sum of
the charges is still Q.

636
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:54,28
They may hear the cat scream,
that's all they can hear.

637
00:42:54,28 --> 00:42:59,36
But they have no way of knowing
that I'm fooling around there

638
00:42:59,36 --> 00:43:03,086
with charges.
And so the outside world has no

639
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:06,557
way of knowing what happens on
the inside.

640
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:09,943
And we call that electrostatic
shielding.

641
00:43:09,943 --> 00:43:12,907
That's the effect of a Faraday
cage.

642
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:17,817
I want to demonstrate when I
bring this can in the electric

643
00:43:17,817 --> 00:43:22,474
field, it's a conducting hollow
object, I bring it in an

644
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:26,538
electric field of the
VandeGraaff, the thing is a

645
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:31,328
conductor,
I will show you that because of

646
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:36,176
the induction you're going to
get like you see on that figure

647
00:43:36,176 --> 00:43:39,973
you're going to get negative
charge on one side,

648
00:43:39,973 --> 00:43:44,498
positive charge on the other
side, and zero charge on the

649
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,76
inside.
That's quite amazing,

650
00:43:46,76 --> 00:43:49,265
isn't it?
If this were positive,

651
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:52,577
let's assume it is,
then this side becomes

652
00:43:52,577 --> 00:43:57,263
negative, this side becomes
positive, the whole thing is an

653
00:43:57,263 --> 00:43:59,768
equipotential,
no charge inside.

654
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:04,413
Quite amazing.
So let's turn on this,

655
00:44:04,413 --> 00:44:08,344
the VandeGraaff.
So we create that electric

656
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:11,526
field.
We turn on the electroscope.

657
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:17,048
Here is my little Ping Pong
ball conducting and I'm going to

658
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:21,821
touch first the can on your
side, on your left side,

659
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:25,752
there we go,
and I bring this charge on the

660
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:28,56
electroscope.
Boy, nice charge.

661
00:44:28,56 --> 00:44:33,708
I now touch the other side,
and I will approach the -- I

662
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:37,752
heard a
spark, sparks are always bad.

663
00:44:37,752 --> 00:44:41,273
I approach that electroscope,
and if the reading of the

664
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:44,142
electroscope,
if the deflection becomes less,

665
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:47,729
as we discussed earlier,
it means that the polarity that

666
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:51,902
I have on here is different from
the polarity on the electroscope

667
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:55,359
and you clearly see that.
The deflection becomes less.

668
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,206
So the charge that I took off
from this side has a different

669
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:02,728
polarity than the charge that I
took on from that side.

670
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:06,64
But yet, it's an equipotential.
All that strange polarization

671
00:45:06,64 --> 00:45:09,621
of
charges takes place at the

672
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:11,749
surface.
And now I will try to get

673
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:14,071
inside.
To see whether I can get some

674
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:17,295
charge from the inside,
and there shouldn't be any,

675
00:45:17,295 --> 00:45:20,197
ooh, I have to take this charge
off of course,

676
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:22,648
and I touch this and you see no
charge.

677
00:45:22,648 --> 00:45:25,936
So you've seen three things,
which is quite amazing.

678
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:29,612
That the charge on this side
has a different polarity from

679
00:45:29,612 --> 00:45:33,095
the charge on that side,
and that everything happens on

680
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:35,803
the surface, nothing happens on
the inside.

681
00:45:35,803 --> 00:45:40,317
I could not get any charge
from the inside.

682
00:45:40,317 --> 00:45:45,926
Now we're going to experiment
with more dangerous stuff and

683
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:51,342
that is with the VandeGraaff.
Here you see a Faraday cage

684
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:56,661
with hat -- has some openings,
it's not solid conductor,

685
00:45:56,661 --> 00:46:01,496
but it has small openings,
which doesn't change the

686
00:46:01,496 --> 00:46:05,268
situation too much,
maybe only a little,

687
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:11,264
and I'm going to go inside that
cage, this would also be a nice

688
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:15,657
Faraday
cage but it's very hard for me

689
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:19,201
to crawl in there.
And if I go in there with a

690
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:23,69
radio just like the radio in
your car, then you may not be

691
00:46:23,69 --> 00:46:27,706
able to hear the radio,
even though radio waves is a

692
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:32,195
difficult story because the
shielding that we discussed is

693
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:37,157
only electrostatic shielding and
radio waves are electromagnetic

694
00:46:37,157 --> 00:46:40,307
radiation which strongly
changing fields.

695
00:46:40,307 --> 00:46:45,898
So it may not be as perfect a
shielding as you may think.

696
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:49,8
But we all know if someone
breaks off the antenna of your

697
00:46:49,8 --> 00:46:52,796
car which happens in Cambridge
all the time,

698
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:56,837
you have no reception inside.
Because your car is a Faraday

699
00:46:56,837 --> 00:46:58,718
cage.
And so what I will do,

700
00:46:58,718 --> 00:47:02,55
I will go into the cage,
I will first show you that when

701
00:47:02,55 --> 00:47:05,894
we charge that cage,
that we bring it up to a few

702
00:47:05,894 --> 00:47:09,517
hundred thousand volts,
I'll just hold some tinsel in

703
00:47:09,517 --> 00:47:13,488
my hand, to convince you that
yes indeed this cage will be

704
00:47:13,488 --> 00:47:17,796
charged by
the VandeGraaff provided there

705
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:21,437
is contact here.
And we'll see that yes Marcos

706
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:25,724
give me the full blast,
let's just look at the tinsel,

707
00:47:25,724 --> 00:47:30,335
you see this tinsel clearly
indicates like an electroscope

708
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:33,894
that I'm being charged now.
So I'll jump off,

709
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:37,373
if you can discharge.
Then I will go inside.

710
00:47:37,373 --> 00:47:42,307
I will have the tinsel with me.
So I will show you that inside

711
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:47,485
there when they charge that cage
that the tinsels will not spread

712
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:51,063
out,
and I will bring with me this

713
00:47:51,063 --> 00:47:54,647
wonderful radio and -- Radio:
Said a woman who opposes

714
00:47:54,647 --> 00:47:58,637
embalming is a suspect in the
murders -- [laughter] I didn't

715
00:47:58,637 --> 00:48:01,882
plan that, believe me.
Radio: [unintelligible] --

716
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:04,722
self-proclaimed prophet,
Catherine Padilla,

717
00:48:04,722 --> 00:48:08,036
grandmother of ten,
denies the charges and tells a

718
00:48:08,036 --> 00:48:12,296
reporter she's not quote -- I'll
first go in without any charge.

719
00:48:12,296 --> 00:48:15,609
But don't do anything.
Radio: [unintelligible] And

720
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:19,599
she's one that -- when she calls
her own --

721
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,092
[unintelligible] Nothing.
I'm shielded.

722
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:28,331
However, there is a problem.
You can still hear me and I'm

723
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:33,663
wearing a transmitter and the
receiver is somewhere outside

724
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:37,156
this box.
So why can you still hear me?

725
00:48:37,156 --> 00:48:41,568
That means that the kind of
radio waves that I am

726
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:46,532
transmitting are very high
frequency, it's not a static

727
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:51,313
field, so somehow they can get
through.

728
00:48:51,313 --> 00:48:56,257
So the shielding is not perfect
for fast changing electric

729
00:48:56,257 --> 00:48:59,207
fields.
But it's good enough for AM

730
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:02,417
radios.
So now I'll go in and I'll try

731
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:06,494
to be brave and he's going to
try to zap me now,

732
00:49:06,494 --> 00:49:10,572
to electrocute me.
But since I've taken eight oh

733
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,781
two, I'm not afraid.
I burned my hand,

734
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:16,21
that's a different story.
OK.

735
00:49:16,21 --> 00:49:18,553
Marcos.
Do the best you can.

736
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:22,804
Here are the tinsels.
Run it up a hundred thousand

737
00:49:22,804 --> 00:49:27,314
volts.
Two hundred thousand volts.

738
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:31,823
I feel as happy like a clam at
high tide inside here.

739
00:49:31,823 --> 00:49:35,639
Nothing is happening.
I'm not worried at all.

740
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,108
If lightning were to strike me
who cares?

741
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:43,618
I'm in a Faraday cage.
Not going to spoil my weekend.

742
00:49:43,618 --> 00:49:47,867
I can touch the inside.
There's no charge anywhere

743
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:50,729
here.
My weekend won't be spoiled.

744
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:55,498
And I hope that the new
assignment is not going to spoil

745
00:49:55,498 --> 50:00
yours either.
See you next Tuesday.
