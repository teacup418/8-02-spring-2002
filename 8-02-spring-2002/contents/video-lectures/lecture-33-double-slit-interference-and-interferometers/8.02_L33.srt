00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,35



2
00:00:00,35 --> 00:00:05,147
I'm very proud of you.
You did very well on the last

3
00:00:05,147 --> 00:00:08,345
exam.
Class average is a little bit

4
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:11,167
above seventy.
Congratulations.

5
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:15,964
There were twenty-two students
who scored a hundred.

6
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:21,138
Many of you are interested in
where the dividing line is

7
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:25,465
between C and D.
If I take only the three exams

8
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,475
into account,
forget the quizzes,

9
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:32,802
forget the homework,
forget the

10
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:37,689
motor, and you add up the three
grades of your three exams,

11
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:42,493
the dividing line between C and
D will be somewhere in the

12
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:47,044
region a hundred thirty-five to
a hundred thirty-eight.

13
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:51,764
So you can use that for your
calibration where you stand.

14
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:56,904
The controversy between Newton
and Huygens about the nature of

15
00:00:56,904 --> 00:01:01,877
light was settled in eighteen oh
one when Young demonstrated

16
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:06,28
convincingly
that light shows all the

17
00:01:06,28 --> 00:01:11,063
characteristic of waves.
Now in the early twentieth

18
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:17,091
century, the particle character
of light surfaced again and this

19
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:21,875
um mysterious and very
fascinating duality of being

20
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:27,711
waves and particles at the same
time is now beautifully merged

21
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:32,495
in quantum mechanics.
But today I will focus on the

22
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:35,562
wave
character only.

23
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:41,71
Very characteristic for waves
are interference patterns which

24
00:01:41,71 --> 00:01:47,447
are produced by two sources,
which simultaneously produce

25
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:52,058
traveling waves at exactly the
same frequency.

26
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:58,001
Let this be source number one
and let this be source number

27
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,177
two.
And they each produce waves

28
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:08,042
with the same frequency,
therefore the same wavelength,

29
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:12,573
and they go out let's say in
all directions.

30
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:18,158
They could be spherical,
in the case of water surface,

31
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:23,321
going out like rings.
And suppose you were here at

32
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:28,59
position P in space at a
distance R one from source

33
00:02:28,59 --> 00:02:34,596
number one and at a distance R
two from source number two.

34
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:40,603
Then it is possible that at the
point P the two waves that

35
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:45,05
arrive are in
phase with each other.

36
00:02:45,05 --> 00:02:49,628
That means the mountain from
two arrives at the same time as

37
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,585
a mountain from one,
and the valley from two arrives

38
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,611
at the same time as the valley
from one.

39
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:01,189
So the mountains become higher
and the valleys become lower.

40
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:04,138
We call that constructive
interference.

41
00:03:04,138 --> 00:03:08,716
It is also possible that the
waves as they arrive at point P

42
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:12,518
are exactly a hundred eighty
degrees out of phase,

43
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:17,647
so that means that the
mountain from two arrives at

44
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:20,45
the same time as the valley from
one.

45
00:03:20,45 --> 00:03:24,732
In which case they can kill
each other, and that we call

46
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:28,859
destructive interference.
You can have this with water

47
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:32,207
waves, so it's on a
two-dimensional surface.

48
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:35,789
You can also have it with
sound, which would be

49
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:39,059
three-dimensional.
So the waves go out on a

50
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,473
sphere.
And you can have it with

51
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:45,521
electromagnetic radiation as we
will

52
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:49,18
also see today,
which is of course also three

53
00:03:49,18 --> 00:03:52,34
dimensions.
If particles oscillate then

54
00:03:52,34 --> 00:03:57,496
their energy is proportional to
the square of their amplitudes.

55
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:01,072
So therefore since energy must
be conserved,

56
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:05,23
the amplitude of sound
oscillations and also of the

57
00:04:05,23 --> 00:04:09,887
electric vector in the case of
electromagnetic radiation,

58
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:14,211
the amplitude must fall off as
one over the distance,

59
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:18,286
one over R.
Because you're talking

60
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:22,687
about three-D waves.
You're talking about spherical

61
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:25,415
waves.
And the surface area of a

62
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:30,52
sphere grows with R squared.
And so the amplitude must fall

63
00:04:30,52 --> 00:04:33,953
off as one over R.
Now if we look at the

64
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:39,322
superposition of two waves in
this case at point P and we make

65
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:44,78
the distance large so that R one
and R two are much much larger

66
00:04:44,78 --> 00:04:48,652
than the separation between
these two points,

67
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:53,141
then this fact that the
amplitude of

68
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:58,366
the wave from two is slightly
smaller than the amplitude from

69
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:02,632
the wave from one can then be
pretty much ignored.

70
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:07,421
Imagine that the path from here
to here is one-half of a

71
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:11,687
wavelength longer than the path
from here to here.

72
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:16,998
That means that this wave from
here to here will have traveled

73
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:21,526
half a period of an oscillation
longer than this one.

74
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:27,001
And that means they are
exactly a hundred eighty

75
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:32,363
degrees out of phase and so the
two can kill each other.

76
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:36,361
And we call that destructive
interference.

77
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:41,918
And so we're going to have
destructive interference when R

78
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,768
two minus R one is for instance
plus or minus one-half lambda

79
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:53,033
but it could also be plus or
minus three-halves lambda,

80
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:57,129
five-halves lambda,
and so on.

81
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:03,522
And so in general you would
have destructive interference if

82
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:10,132
the difference between R two and
R one is two N plus one times

83
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:15,008
lambda divided by two whereby N
is an integer,

84
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,801
could be zero,
or plus or minus one,

85
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:22,16
or plus or minus two,
and so on.

86
00:06:22,16 --> 00:06:27,686
That's when you would have
destructive interference.

87
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:35,313
We would have constructive
interference if R two minus R

88
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:41,997
one is simply N times lambda.
So then the waves at point P

89
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:46,805
are in phase and N is again
could be zero,

90
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:51,027
plus or minus one,
plus or minus two,

91
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:55,6
and so on.
If the sum of the distance to

92
00:06:55,6 --> 00:07:03,692
two points is a constant you get
an ellipse in mathematics.

93
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:07,881
If the difference is a
constant, which is the case

94
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:12,498
here, the difference to two
points is a constant value,

95
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:17,543
for instance one-half lambda,
then the curve is a hyperbola.

96
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:22,331
It would be a hyperbola if we
deal with a two-dimensional

97
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:25,239
surface.
But if we think of this as

98
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:29,086
three-dimensional,
so you can rotate the whole

99
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:34,387
thing about this axis,
then you get hyperboloids,

100
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:40,428
you get bowl-shaped surfaces.
And so if I'm now trying to

101
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:46,468
tighten the nuts a little bit,
suppose I have here two of

102
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:53,263
these sources that produce waves
and the separation between them

103
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:59,195
is D, then it is obvious that
the line right through the

104
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:05,882
middle of them and perpendicular
to them is always a maximum if

105
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:10,841
the two sources
are oscillating in phase.

106
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:15,838
So this line is immediately
clear that R two minus R one is

107
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:18,768
zero here.
If the two are in phase.

108
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:23,335
And they always have to
generate the same frequency of

109
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,523
course.
So this line would be always a

110
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:29,452
maximum.
Constructive interference.

111
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:32,124
It's this zero substitute
there.

112
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:36,777
And in case that we're talking
about three-dimensional,

113
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:43,009
this is of course a plane.
Going perpendicular to the

114
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:46,527
blackboard right through the
middle.

115
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:52,257
The difference R two minus R
one equals lambda would again

116
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:55,575
give me constructive
interference.

117
00:08:55,575 --> 00:09:01,104
That would be a hyperbola then,
R two minus R one equals

118
00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:06,934
lambda, that would again be a
maximum, and you can draw the

119
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:13,167
same line on this side,
and then R two minus R one

120
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:17,113
being two lambda again would be
a maximum.

121
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:22,119
And again if this is
three-dimensional you can rotate

122
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:25,584
it about this line and you get
bowls.

123
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:30,397
And so in between you're
obviously going to get the

124
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:33,863
minima, the destructive
interference,

125
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:38,868
lambda divided by two,
and then here you would have R

126
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:42,526
two minus R one is three-halves
lambda.

127
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:49,246
We call these lines where
you kill each other destructive

128
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:53,226
interference,
we call them nodal lines or in

129
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:57,299
case you have a surface it's a
nodal surface.

130
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,928
And the maxima are sometimes
also called antinodes,

131
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:06,093
but I may also refer to them
simply as maxima.

132
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:10,814
And so this is what we call an
interference pattern.

133
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:16,09
If you look right here between
on the line between the two

134
00:10:16,09 --> 00:10:21,054
points then
you should be able to convince

135
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:25,557
yourself that the linear
separation here between two

136
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:28,56
lines of maxima is one-half
lambda.

137
00:10:28,56 --> 00:10:32,181
Figure that out at home.
That's very easy.

138
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:37,567
Also the distance between these
two yellow lines here right in

139
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:42,689
between is one-half lambda.
And so that tells you then that

140
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:48,253
the number of lines or surfaces
which are maxima is very roughly

141
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:52,014
two D
divided by one-half lambda.

142
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:56,181
So this is the number of
maxima, which is also the same

143
00:10:56,181 --> 00:11:00,733
roughly as the number of minima,
is then approximately two D

144
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:04,515
divided by lambda.
And so if you want more maxima,

145
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:08,604
if you want more of these
surfaces, you have a choice,

146
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:13,234
you can make D larger or you
can make the wavelength shorter.

147
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:17,555
And if you make the wavelength
shorter you can do that by

148
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:23,393
increasing the frequency
if you had that control.

149
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:30,658
The first thing that I'm going
to do is to make you see these

150
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:35,622
nodal lines with a demonstration
of water.

151
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:42,887
We have here two sources that
we can tap on the water and the

152
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:49,788
distance between those two
tappers, D, is ten centimeters,

153
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:54,094
so we're
talking about water here.

154
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:59,196
Uh we will tap with a frequency
of about seven hertz and what

155
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:03,108
you're going to see are very
clear nodal lines,

156
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:07,956
this is a two-dimensional
surface, where the water doesn't

157
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:11,442
move at all.
The mountains and the valleys

158
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:15,865
arrive at the same time.
The water is never moving at

159
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,586
all.
So let me make sure that you

160
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:23,988
can see that well.
And so I have to change my --

161
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:26,946
my lights.
I'll first turn it on,

162
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:31,291
that may be the easiest.
Starts tapping already.

163
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,527
I can see the nodal lines very
well.

164
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:40,258
So here you see the two tappers
and here you see a line whereby

165
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:45,62
the water is not moving at all.
At all moments in time it's

166
00:12:45,62 --> 00:12:48,023
standing still.
Here's one.

167
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:51,906
Here is one.
And you even with a little bit

168
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:55,596
of
imagination can see that they

169
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:59,3
are really not straight lines
but they are hyperbolas.

170
00:12:59,3 --> 00:13:03,213
If you're very close to one
tapper, the zero can never be

171
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:06,078
exactly zero,
because the amplitude of the

172
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,782
wave from this one then will
always be larger than the

173
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:13,625
amplitude from that one,
because as you go away from the

174
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:17,958
source the amplitude must fall
off on a two-dimensional surface

175
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,194
as one over the square root of
R.

176
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:25,155
In a three-dimensional wave
must fall of as one over R.

177
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:28,045
But if you're far enough away
then the distance is

178
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:31,642
approximately the same and so
the amplitudes of the individual

179
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:35,18
waves are very closely the same
and you can then like you see

180
00:13:35,18 --> 00:13:37,716
here the water is absolutely
standing still.

181
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:41,195
And here are then the areas
whereby you see traveling waves,

182
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,261
they are traveling waves,
they're not standing waves,

183
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,799
that here you see if you were
sitting here in space the water

184
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,217
would be up and down,
bobbing up and down,

185
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:53,106
and the amplitude that you
would have is twice the

186
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:57,647
amplitude that you get from one,
because the mountains add

187
00:13:57,647 --> 00:14:02,335
to the mountains and the
valleys add to the valleys.

188
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:07,484
But if you were here in space
you would be sitting still.

189
00:14:07,484 --> 00:14:11,438
You would not be bobbing up and
down at all.

190
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:15,207
And that is very characteristic
for waves.

191
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:20,632
If I were to tap them a hundred
eighty degrees out of phase,

192
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:26,056
which I didn't -- they were in
phase -- then all nodal lines

193
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:30,5
would become
maxima and all maximum lines

194
00:14:30,5 --> 00:14:34,024
would become nodes,
that goes without saying of

195
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:36,629
course.
It is essential that you --

196
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:41,149
that the frequencies are the
same, that is an absolute must.

197
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:44,75
They don't have to be in phase,
the two tappers,

198
00:14:44,75 --> 00:14:49,347
if they're not in phase then
the positions in space where you

199
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:53,638
have maxima and minima will
change but a must is that the

200
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:57,545
frequency is the same.
Now I was hiking last year in

201
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:01,682
Utah when I noticed a butterfly
in the

202
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:05,176
water of a pond which was
fighting for its life.

203
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:07,481
And you see that butterfly
here.

204
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:10,901
Tom, perhaps you can turn off
that uh overhead.

205
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:15,064
You see the butterfly here,
and you see here projected on

206
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:18,483
the bottom the beautiful rings
dark and bright,

207
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:22,051
because these rings on the
water act like lenses,

208
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:25,768
and what you see very
dramatically is indeed what I

209
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:30,452
said, that the amplitude of the
wave must go down with distance,

210
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:34,317
because energy must be
conserved of

211
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:37,567
course in the wave,
and since the circumference

212
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,171
grows linearly with R,
the amplitude must go down as

213
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:45,339
one over the square root of R
because the energy in the wave

214
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,165
is proportional to the amplitude
squared.

215
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:52,334
So when I saw this it occurred
to me that it would be a good

216
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:55,866
idea to catch another butterfly,
put it next to it,

217
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:59,752
and then photograph -- make a
fantastic photograph of an

218
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:02,931
interference pattern.
But I realized of course

219
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:07,383
immediately having taken eight
oh two that the

220
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:13,634
frequencies of the two
butterflies would have to be

221
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:21,385
exactly the same and so I gave
up the idea and I decided not to

222
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:25,635
be cruel.
So no other butterfly was

223
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:30,511
sacrificed.
If we look at the directions

224
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:37,762
where we expect the maxima as
seen from the location of the

225
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:44,639
sources, then I want to remind
you of what a

226
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,222
hyperbola looks like.
If here are these two sources

227
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:55,248
and here is the center I can
draw a line here,

228
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:59,38
then a hyperbola would look
like this.

229
00:16:59,38 --> 00:17:06,192
Let me re- remove the part on
the left, doesn't look too good,

230
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:10,547
but it's the same on the left
of course.

231
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:17,248
And what you remember from your
high school math,

232
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:23,072
that it approaches that line.
And therefore you can define

233
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:28,998
angle theta as seen from the
center between these two which

234
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:34,925
are the directions where you
have maxima and where you have

235
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:38,603
minima.
And that's what I am going to

236
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:43,099
work out for you now on this
blackboard here.

237
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:47,799
So here are now the two sources
that oscillate,

238
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,397
there's one here and there's
one

239
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:57,222
here and here is the center in
between them,

240
00:17:57,222 --> 00:18:03,842
and let this separation be D.
And I am looking very far away

241
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:10,462
so that I'm approaching this
line where the hyperbolas merge

242
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:14,277
so to speak with the straight
line.

243
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:20,335
And so I look very far away
without being -- committing

244
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:25,734
myself how far,
I'm looking in the direction

245
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,95
theta away.
This is theta.

246
00:18:27,95 --> 00:18:32,205
And so this is theta.
And I want to know in which

247
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:37,08
directions of theta I expect to
see maxima, and in which

248
00:18:37,08 --> 00:18:39,916
direction I expect to see
minima.

249
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:44,968
So this is what we called
earlier R one and we called this

250
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:48,514
earlier R two,
it is the distance to that

251
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:52,768
point very far away.
If I want to know what R two

252
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:57,667
minus
R one is that's very easy now.

253
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:03,032
I draw a line from here
perpendicular to this line and

254
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:09,005
you see immediately that this
distance here is R two minus R

255
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:12,346
one.
But that distance is also you

256
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:18,623
realize that this angle is theta
it's the same one as that one,

257
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:22,875
so that distance here is also D
sine theta.

258
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:27,431
And so now I'm in business,
I can

259
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:32,364
predict in what directions we
will see constructive

260
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:36,409
interference.
Because all we are demanding

261
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,651
now, requesting,
that R two minus R one is N

262
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:44,499
times lambda.
And so we need that D sine

263
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:49,235
theta and I'll give it a
subindex N, as in Nancy,

264
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:54,267
equals N times lambda.
In others words that the sine

265
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:59,553
of theta N is simply N lambda
divided by D.

266
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:03,598
And that uniquely defines all
those directions,

267
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:08,873
the whole zoo of directions N
equals zero, that is the center

268
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,686
line, N equals one,
N equals two,

269
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:13,884
N equals three,
and so on.

270
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:17,928
And then I have the whole
family of destructive

271
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:21,796
interference.
Which would require that lambda

272
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:26,72
R two minus R one which is D
sine theta must now be two N

273
00:20:26,72 --> 00:20:32,33
plus one
times lambda divided by two.

274
00:20:32,33 --> 00:20:37,457
Just as we had it on the
blackboard there.

275
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:44,459
We discussed that earlier.
And so that requires then that

276
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:51,211
the sine of theta N for the
destructive interference is

277
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:58,213
going to be two N plus one times
lambda divided by two D.

278
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:03,204
So this
indicates the directions where

279
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:08,839
we expect maxima and where we
expect minima as seen from the

280
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:14,475
center between the two sources.
But now I would like to know

281
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:20,588
what the linear distance is if I
project this onto a screen which

282
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:25,077
is very far away.
And so let us have a screen at

283
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:29,853
a distance capital L which has
to be very far away,

284
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:34,056
so here are now the two
sources.

285
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:38,74
It's a different scale.
And here is a screen.

286
00:21:38,74 --> 00:21:44,702
And the distance b- from the
two sources to the screen is

287
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:48,321
capital L.
And here is one of those

288
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:53,325
direction theta.
And you see immediately that if

289
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:58,222
I call this the direction X,
X being zero here,

290
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:02,8
that the tangent of theta is X
divided by L.

291
00:22:02,8 --> 00:22:06,952
If but only if I deal with
small angles,

292
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:13,983
the tangent of theta is the
same as the sine of theta.

293
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:19,889
And therefore I can now tell
you where the maxima will lie on

294
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:25,402
that screen away from the center
line, which I call zero,

295
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:30,521
that is now when X of N is L
times the sine of theta,

296
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:35,935
in small angle approximation.
So this is approximately L

297
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:41,35
times N lambda divided by D,
and for the same reason you

298
00:22:41,35 --> 00:22:44,838
will get
here c- destructive

299
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:49,395
interference when X of N is
going to be L times two N plus

300
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:52,033
one times lambda divided by two
D.

301
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:55,711
That is simple geometry.
So now we have all the

302
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:59,708
ingredients here on the
blackboard and I'm going to

303
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:03,066
leave it there for the rest of
the lecture.

304
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:07,543
Whenever we're going to do an
experiment with two sources

305
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:12,34
which are in phase at the same
frequency, you can predict the

306
00:23:12,34 --> 00:23:17,287
directions of
maxima and minima and you can

307
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:21,82
even predict the separation,
the linear separation,

308
00:23:21,82 --> 00:23:26,443
if you know how far away you
are from these sources.

309
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:31,429
And the first demonstration
that I'm going to do is with

310
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:34,692
sound.
We have here two loudspeakers.

311
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:38,953
And the distance between those
two loudspeakers,

312
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:43,666
we're going to do it with
sound, D, is one point five

313
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,204
meters.
That's

314
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:49,733
a given.
And the frequency is three

315
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:53,884
thousand hertz.
The wavelength therefore,

316
00:23:53,884 --> 00:24:00,421
lambda, equals V divided by the
frequency, the speed of sound is

317
00:24:00,421 --> 00:24:06,648
about three hundred forty meters
per second, divided by three

318
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:11,629
thousand, is about oh point one
one three meters.

319
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:17,544
So the wavelength is about
eleven point three centimeters.

320
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:22,795
I can now calculate
everyone who is sitting here

321
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,518
fweet right in the middle
through this whole plane will

322
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:30,035
have a maximum of sound,
and then when we go away at

323
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:34,034
angle theta, some will again
have maxima, and we go further

324
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:37,551
away theta, again maxima,
and in between will be the

325
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,826
minima.
And I'm going to calculate

326
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:42,239
where they fall in the lecture
hall.

327
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:46,514
The first thing that I'm going
to do is I'm going to give you N

328
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:50,513
as in Nancy and calculate that
angle theta

329
00:24:50,513 --> 00:24:53,509
of N and I will do it for the
maxima.

330
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:57,171
In other words,
I'm going to use constructive

331
00:24:57,171 --> 00:25:01,998
interference and you see that
the sine of theta N is lambda

332
00:25:01,998 --> 00:25:05,244
divided by D.
That's the equation I use.

333
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:07,907
When N is zero the angle is
zero.

334
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:11,569
That is zero angle.
Everyone here will hear a

335
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:13,4
maximum.
When N is one,

336
00:25:13,4 --> 00:25:18,559
and you may want to check that
at home, I find an angle of four

337
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,072
point three degrees,
and when N is two,

338
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:27,611
the angle is about double that,
is about eight point seven

339
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:32,31
degrees, and when N is three,
it should be close to thirteen

340
00:25:32,31 --> 00:25:36,611
degrees, thirteen point one.
In case you take N is ten,

341
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:39,796
so I skip a few,
you get about forty-nine

342
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:42,902
degrees.
This is where the maximum fall.

343
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:47,68
And so there's going to be a
maximum here and then four point

344
00:25:47,68 --> 00:25:50,627
three degrees away is again a
maximum.

345
00:25:50,627 --> 00:25:56,108
But surely we would like
to know how far you in the

346
00:25:56,108 --> 00:26:01,405
audience will have to move in
order to go from a maximum to a

347
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:04,406
minimum.
And so the way you have to

348
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:09,703
think of this is that if I make
here a picture of the lecture

349
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:14,912
hall, if here are these two
sources, you are at a distance L

350
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:18,62
away from here.
Some of you are five meters

351
00:26:18,62 --> 00:26:21,268
away.
Some are ten meters away.

352
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:27,529
Some are fifteen meters away,
all the way in the back of the

353
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:30,403
audience.
And you want to know where

354
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:34,51
you're going to hear the maxima.
I call this X one,

355
00:26:34,51 --> 00:26:37,96
I call this X two,
and I call this X three,

356
00:26:37,96 --> 00:26:41,903
and this is zero.
So this is the meaning of theta

357
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:44,367
one.
And this is the meaning of

358
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:48,556
theta three, and this angle here
would be theta two.

359
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:51,349
That's the meaning of these
angles.

360
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:55,455
And so I can calculate now how
far

361
00:26:55,455 --> 00:27:02,495
you have to move depending upon
what capital L is to hear to go

362
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:07,491
from one maximum in sound to
another maximum.

363
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:14,303
And we raise the a little more.
And so I will show you now s-

364
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:20,094
some of the results for maxima.
So I only go now for

365
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:27,587
constructive interference.
And I have done this for three

366
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:31,323
different distances.
Those of you who are five

367
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:34,975
meters away from me,
ten meters away from me,

368
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:37,548
and fifteen meters away from
me.

369
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:41,699
And what you see on the left
side is going to be X,

370
00:27:41,699 --> 00:27:46,43
that is the linear separation,
and these, so these were in

371
00:27:46,43 --> 00:27:50,83
meters, forgive me but I will do
these in centimeters.

372
00:27:50,83 --> 00:27:54,565
And this is X one,
if you are five meters away

373
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:59,462
from me, you will have -- I will
put X one a

374
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:04,339
little lower than I have it
now, you will see shortly why I

375
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:09,048
put it a little lower -- X one
this is about thirty-eight

376
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:12,496
centimeters.
So the linear separation from

377
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:16,111
one to the next is thirty-eight
centimeters.

378
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,811
And you're ten meters away,
it's double that,

379
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:23,427
that's no surprise,
seventy-six centimeters.

380
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:27,799
And if you're fifteen meters
away it is a hundred and

381
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:33,063
thirteen centimeters.
And then X two which is the

382
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:38,198
position where you have another
maximum would be at seventy-six

383
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:42,588
centimeters and it would be at a
hundred and fifty-two

384
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:47,392
centimeters and it would be at
two hundred and twenty-eight

385
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,451
centimeters if you're fifteen
meters away from me.

386
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:56,338
So the minima will fall almost
exactly in between and so the

387
00:28:56,338 --> 00:29:01,887
minima where in an ideal case
there is no sound at all,

388
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:05,095
sound plus sound gives silence,
think about it,

389
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:08,931
sound plus sound will give
silence, will be when you are

390
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:12,068
roughly at nineteen centimeters,
half of this,

391
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:14,649
this will be thirty-eight
centimeters.

392
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:17,717
Half of this,
and here will be something like

393
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:21,203
fifty-seven centimeters.
And you can calculate what

394
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:24,341
these values are,
they are exactly in between.

395
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:28,525
And so the conclusion is that
if you're five meters away from

396
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:32,152
me and you're near the center
line,

397
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:35,654
but you can also be a little
bit in this direction,

398
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:38,457
that the separation between
bright sound,

399
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:42,59
loud sound, which is always at
zero of course in the middle,

400
00:29:42,59 --> 00:29:44,972
to silence is nineteen
centimeters.

401
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:48,755
And then you move another
nineteen centimeters and then

402
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:52,188
you hear loud sound.
If you are however ten meters

403
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:54,64
away from me,
just past the cameras,

404
00:29:54,64 --> 00:29:58,213
then you have to move
thirty-eight centimeters to go

405
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,067
from loud sound to silence.
And if you're all the way in

406
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:05,64
the audience,
in the back of the

407
00:30:05,64 --> 00:30:09,41
audience, it's more like sixty
centimeters.

408
00:30:09,41 --> 00:30:13,629
And this is what we're going to
do now together.

409
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:19,104
I want you all to stand up and
I'm going to make you listen to

410
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:23,682
three thousand hertz.
And what I want you to do when

411
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:28,978
I turn on the two loudspeakers,
I want you to move your head

412
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:33,556
very slowly and try to find
locations where you hear

413
00:30:33,556 --> 00:30:37,777
silence.
The position of silence is

414
00:30:37,777 --> 00:30:41,73
extremely well-defined,
so don't go too fast,

415
00:30:41,73 --> 00:30:45,324
you miss it,
also keep in mind that there

416
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:49,187
are reflections of the sound
from the walls,

417
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:54,038
and from the blackboard,
and so the pattern that I have

418
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:59,249
calculated here is not perfect.
But you will see that there

419
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:04,01
will be locations where sound
plus sound will give you

420
00:31:04,01 --> 00:31:06,615
silence.
[tone]

421
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:12,125
[tone] You are a couple of
lousy scientists.

422
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:17,635
[tone] You are a couple of
lousy scientists.

423
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:25,707
If the separation between a lot
of sound and silence is nineteen

424
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:32,498
centimeters, that's about the
separation of your ears,

425
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:37,111
you dummies,
so one ear could be at a

426
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:42,749
maximum, the other ear could be
at a minimum,

427
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:49,284
so at least close one ear.
[laughter] [tone] Go very

428
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:53
slowly.
[tone]

429
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57,404
Who has found clear location
where [tone] the sound is nearly

430
00:31:57,404 --> 00:32:01,148
zero [tone] or practically zero?
[tone] Most of you.

431
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:05,038
And you certainly can hear if
you move that there's an

432
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,342
enormous difference [tone] in
sound intensity.

433
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:12,232
[tone] [tone] So again,
who has found locations [tone]

434
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:15,976
whereby you clearly say this is
practically silence?

435
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,426
[tone] Ah, you see them all the
way in the back,

436
00:32:19,426 --> 00:32:23,243
[tone] [tone] and the
separation, how far you have to

437
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:28,434
move, depends on
how far you are away from me.

438
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:32,539
Sit down again.
[audience noise] Young was a

439
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:38,076
sound engineer and as a sound
engineer he was very familiar

440
00:32:38,076 --> 00:32:43,709
with the interference of sound.
He knew that sound and sound

441
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:48,005
can make silence.
And so in eighteen oh one he

442
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:54,115
demonstrated in a convincing way
that light plus light can create

443
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:57,743
darkness.
That would be the nail in the

444
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:01,944
coffin
that would demonstrate uniquely

445
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:05,787
that light are indeed waves,
and there was still this

446
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:10,369
controversy between Huygens and
Newton as you perhaps remember.

447
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:14,286
Newton wanted light to be
particles but Huygens wanted

448
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:17,76
them to be waves.
And the way that Young did his

449
00:33:17,76 --> 00:33:20,79
experiment is as follows.
He had a screen,

450
00:33:20,79 --> 00:33:24,781
don't think of it as this big,
you're talking now about

451
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:28,624
extraordinarily small
dimensions, you will understand

452
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:32,888
shortly how
small, and in this screen are

453
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,923
two openings,
two pinholes,

454
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:39,617
and light is coming from the
left and think of light as being

455
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,825
plain waves.
They reach these two openings

456
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:47,832
and these two openings according
to Huygens will produce circular

457
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:51,979
waves, spherical waves of
course, three-dimensionally.

458
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:56,751
These openings become Huygens
sources and spherical waves will

459
00:33:56,751 --> 00:34:02,776
propagate out in this direction.
And so now we have exactly the

460
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:05,483
situation that we had with our
sound.

461
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:09,845
Now if all works well there
should be directions theta away

462
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:14,131
from this line where you see
darkness and other directions

463
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:18,418
where you see bright light.
And we are going to do it in a

464
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:23,005
way, we have the luxury of laser
beams, so we have very strong

465
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:25,938
light sources,
which Young did not have.

466
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,773
The way we are going to do it,
we have a -- a slide,

467
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:34,987
which is completely black,
but with a razor blade two

468
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:39,739
lines have been drawn on it.
And so I will draw these lines

469
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:43,262
as white lines.
But they're really openings.

470
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:47,85
And there is another one here.
And the separation between

471
00:34:47,85 --> 00:34:52,111
these lines D is oh point oh
eight eight millimeters,

472
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:54,815
less than a tenth of a
millimeter.

473
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:59,239
When you look at them you
cannot even see that they are

474
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:02,434
two lines.
Our laser beam has a diameter

475
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:07,911
of about three millimeters,
which is thirty times larger

476
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:10,631
than this distance,
thirty times larger.

477
00:35:10,631 --> 00:35:14,886
So what I'm going to show you
now that this is our laser beam,

478
00:35:14,886 --> 00:35:18,025
is not to scale,
the laser beam is much larger

479
00:35:18,025 --> 00:35:20,397
than that.
And so the light will go

480
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:24,443
through some parts of these
slots, as far as our laser beam

481
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:28,698
reaches, and we are now capable
of predicting when we're going

482
00:35:28,698 --> 00:35:32,046
to project it there,
here are the two slots which

483
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,882
are like so, and so you're going
to get

484
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:39,998
interference patterns in these
directions theta,

485
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:45,252
and we can calculate what the
position X is going to be there

486
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:49,367
between the maxima.
And so if that is the screen

487
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:54,446
and if this is X equals zero,
and if this is X one and this

488
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:58,999
is X two, and of course the
whole thing is symmetric,

489
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:02,764
you can always go in the
opposite direction,

490
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:08,28
you can now calculate,
and you have all the tools,

491
00:36:08,28 --> 00:36:11,543
I did it for you in great
detail using sound,

492
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:15,325
but you have all the tools to
do it now, you know D,

493
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:19,329
I'm going to tell you what
lambda is, it's six thousand

494
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:23,778
three hundred and twenty-eight
Angstroms, and one Angstrom is

495
00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:27,93
ten to the minus ten meters,
so you can calculate all the

496
00:36:27,93 --> 00:36:32,453
direction theta for which there
are maxima and for which there

497
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:35,419
are minima.
Minima means light plus light

498
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:37,941
gives darkness,
an amazing concept.

499
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:42,619
And you can then
if you know the distance from

500
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:45,544
here to the screen,
which is capital L,

501
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:49,777
you can calculate what the
separation is as we see it on

502
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:53,856
the screen, and L is roughly ten
meters, maybe eleven,

503
00:36:53,856 --> 00:36:57,551
but that's not so important.
And so I calculated,

504
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:02,399
and you can confirm that -- and
you should confirm that that the

505
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:05,709
angle theta one,
I will only calculate theta

506
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:10,25
one, which is the angle then to
this point, theta zero is of

507
00:37:10,25 --> 00:37:14,888
course always zero,
right, that's the easiest,

508
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:18,627
I find that theta one is oh
point four one degrees,

509
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:22,441
that is for maximum,
and that means that X one given

510
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:26,479
the distance of ten meters then
becomes seven point two

511
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:29,395
centimeters.
So from here to here on the

512
00:37:29,395 --> 00:37:33,957
screen, from maximum to maximum,
will be about seven point two

513
00:37:33,957 --> 00:37:38,518
centimeters, and from here to
here will then of course also be

514
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:42,631
about seven two centimeters,
and in between you will see

515
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:48,883
darkness.
The light from the two sources,

516
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:57,365
a hundred eighty degrees out of
phase, and that will give you

517
00:37:57,365 --> 00:38:02,172
darkness.
Let me turn on the laser.

518
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:09,24
And turn off the lights.
Make sure I have my -- OK.

519
00:38:09,24 --> 00:38:15,602
And there you see it.
There you see a maximum,

520
00:38:15,602 --> 00:38:21,257
darkness, a maximum,
darkness,

521
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,698
a maximum, darkness,
and so on.

522
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:28,255
And the separation if I didn't
make a mistake between the

523
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:31,51
maxima is indeed about seven
centimeters.

524
00:38:31,51 --> 00:38:35,904
Imagine what an incredible
moment this is in your life,

525
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:40,054
that you actually see that
light plus light can make

526
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:43,227
darkness.
So the waves go simultaneously

527
00:38:43,227 --> 00:38:47,296
through both openings,
and each opening acts like a

528
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,934
Huygens source,
and the net result is that

529
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:55,86
these two waves arrive there on
the screen a hundred eighty

530
00:38:55,86 --> 00:38:59,176
degrees out of phase at the
locations of darkness.

531
00:38:59,176 --> 00:39:02,83
The censor is of course that
they have exactly the same

532
00:39:02,83 --> 00:39:06,959
frequency which is what they do,
because we have one laser gun

533
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:10,207
going in and so the wave goes
through both slots.

534
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:13,185
So we're guaranteed,
and that was the secret,

535
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:17,042
that Young understood you're
guaranteed that the waves are

536
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:21,644
not only the same frequency but
they're even in phase

537
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:24,692
because they both go through to
both slots.

538
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:29,191
Now if you look very carefully
here you will see of course that

539
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:32,166
these maxima don't have the same
strength.

540
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:35,866
We will understand next lecture
why that's the case.

541
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:40,22
They would have very closely
the same strength if the opening

542
00:39:40,22 --> 00:39:44,428
where we scratched out the black
on the slide was much much

543
00:39:44,428 --> 00:39:47,984
smaller than the separation
between the two slots,

544
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:51,612
so to speak.
And that separation is

545
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:53,787
point oh eight eight
millimeter.

546
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:56,944
If we make the openings much
narrower, indeed,

547
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:59,961
the light intensities would be
more uniform,

548
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:03,68
each maximum would be
approximately the same strength,

549
00:40:03,68 --> 00:40:06,627
but then very little light will
go through.

550
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:10,275
And so it's a tradeoff.
And the moment you make these

551
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,31
two openings,
these two slots,

552
00:40:12,31 --> 00:40:15,678
larger and larger,
you will understand Friday why

553
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:18,695
then the light intensities are
not the same,

554
00:40:18,695 --> 00:40:22,765
why the light intensity is a
maximum at the center and then

555
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:26,283
falls off
near the edge.

556
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:29,412
As you see.
It's a maximum here,

557
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:33,954
and then the light intensities
become smaller.

558
00:40:33,954 --> 00:40:39,303
I've shown you now the
interference pattern with sound

559
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:44,754
and for red laser light,
but imagine now that I did the

560
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:49,699
same with white light.
The situation would be very

561
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:55,755
different, and maybe even
disappointing for you.

562
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:59,978
Let this be the location on the
screen.

563
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:04,757
So we -- we have X here,
and here X is zero.

564
00:41:04,757 --> 00:41:10,313
And I want to know where the
maxima are in the red,

565
00:41:10,313 --> 00:41:15,869
well that's very easy,
there will be a maximum here

566
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:21,314
when this position is L times
lambda divided by D.

567
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:28,034
This is when Nancy is one.
And there will also be a

568
00:41:28,034 --> 00:41:34,231
maximum here when we have two L
times lambda divided by D.

569
00:41:34,231 --> 00:41:40,536
And of course there will be one
on this side same distance.

570
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:45,971
And there will be one here,
this is when N is zero.

571
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,928
N is one.
N is two.

572
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:54,015
The red light will have maxima.
How about the blue light?

573
00:41:54,015 --> 00:42:00,972
The blue light will have maxima
here, where L lambda

574
00:42:00,972 --> 00:42:03,633
divided by D,
but lambda is different,

575
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:05,934
lambda for blue light is
smaller.

576
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:10,104
Substantially smaller than red
light, so the maximum of the

577
00:42:10,104 --> 00:42:13,555
blue will fall here,
the maximum of the blue will

578
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:16,863
always fall at N equals zero
together with red,

579
00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:20,386
and then Nancy equals two the
blue will fall here,

580
00:42:20,386 --> 00:42:23,478
so this is Nancy two,
Nancy one, Nancy zero.

581
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:26,426
And here Nancy zero,
Nancy one, Nancy two.

582
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:30,812
And so the red and the blue and
therefore all the other colors

583
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:36,252
live a life of their own.
They don't talk to each other.

584
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:40,501
They come in with their own
separation in terms of angles

585
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:44,827
and in terms of locations X.
That's the reason why I chose

586
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:47,938
one and only one frequency with
the sound.

587
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:52,339
Because if I had exposed you to
many different frequencies,

588
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:56,513
many different wavelengths,
then the location of silence

589
00:42:56,513 --> 00:43:00,762
for one wavelength is not the
location of silence for the

590
00:43:00,762 --> 00:43:05,627
other wavelength.
And so the experiment would not

591
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:08,788
have worked.
And that's why it worked so

592
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:11,544
well with the laser,
the red laser,

593
00:43:11,544 --> 00:43:15,84
which is practically one
wavelength, and so the minima

594
00:43:15,84 --> 00:43:19,164
and the maxima are extremely
well-defined.

595
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:22,892
If we had done the experiment
with white light,

596
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:27,026
it wouldn't have been so
impressive, and on the next

597
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:30,998
slide I show you what you w-
would have seen then.

598
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:35,132
This is what white light would
have

599
00:43:35,132 --> 00:43:38,295
done, this is a two-slit
interference pattern.

600
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:40,967
This is what red light would
have done.

601
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:44,201
Red light is a narrow bandwidth
of wavelengths,

602
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:48,138
well-defined black lines,
light plus light give darkness,

603
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:51,513
well-defined maxima,
and the blue notice that the

604
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:55,379
separation between the dark
lines and therefore also the

605
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:59,598
separation between the bright
lines is substantially smaller.

606
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:03,394
Because blue light has a
wavelength of about forty-five

607
00:44:03,394 --> 00:44:07,737
hundred
Angstroms and red light roughly

608
00:44:07,737 --> 00:44:11,764
sixty-five hundred.
So there's a big difference.

609
00:44:11,764 --> 00:44:16,732
And so white light would then
give you the superposition of

610
00:44:16,732 --> 00:44:20,673
all these colors,
and so you don't really get a

611
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:25,899
very nice interference pattern
of dark areas and bright areas,

612
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:31,21
because all the colors begin to
overlap and each live a life of

613
00:44:31,21 --> 00:44:34,466
their own.
What I can do with sound and

614
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:40,719
what I did with water and what I
have done with laser light

615
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,649
I can also do with radio
electromagnetic waves.

616
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:48,921
With radar we have a
ten-gigahertz transmitter here

617
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:52,338
that we have used earlier in
this course.

618
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:57,379
And so I will now show you that
with radar you can also show

619
00:44:57,379 --> 00:45:02,419
interference patterns and the
calculation that you see there

620
00:45:02,419 --> 00:45:07,203
are absolutely identical.
The only thing I want to remind

621
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:11,646
you of, that the approximation
when you

622
00:45:11,646 --> 00:45:15,841
know capital L that the tangent
theta is roughly the same as the

623
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:18,705
sine of theta is only true for
small angles.

624
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:21,435
Five degrees is fine,
ten degrees is fine,

625
00:45:21,435 --> 00:45:25,497
but by the time that you reach
fifty, sixty or seventy degrees

626
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:29,626
that approximation is not true.
So then you really have to take

627
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:32,956
the tangent of theta.
That's no problem because you

628
00:45:32,956 --> 00:45:36,552
first calculate what theta is,
because that equation is

629
00:45:36,552 --> 00:45:41,148
correct, and then you can
calculate always where X is,

630
00:45:41,148 --> 00:45:45,435
but then you use the tangent
and not the sine.

631
00:45:45,435 --> 00:45:50,676
So these are approximations
which hold for small angles.

632
00:45:50,676 --> 00:45:55,63
And so if now we look at a
ten-gigahertz transmitter,

633
00:45:55,63 --> 00:45:58,965
that means we have two
transmitters,

634
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:03,443
one here and one here.
And their separation D is

635
00:46:03,443 --> 00:46:07,54
twenty-three centimeters.
You see them here.

636
00:46:07,54 --> 00:46:13,447
This is where they are.
Here's one and here's the

637
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:16,77
other, twenty-three centimeters
apart.

638
00:46:16,77 --> 00:46:21,438
At ten gigahertz the wavelength
is three centimeters.

639
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:25,838
You can confirm that.
The speed is speed of light.

640
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:30,237
Lambda is the speed of light
divided by frequency.

641
00:46:30,237 --> 00:46:35,624
That gives you the wavelength.
And we have here at a distance

642
00:46:35,624 --> 00:46:40,832
L which is a hundred and twenty
centimeters, we have here a

643
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:46,237
receiver and a track,
so this is X equals zero and

644
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:51,531
here we can move it along X and
so you can calculate now at what

645
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:56,32
angles seen from this point
there will be a maximum there.

646
00:46:56,32 --> 00:47:00,353
Theta zero is obvious.
Right here there will be a

647
00:47:00,353 --> 00:47:02,202
maximum.
The two waves,

648
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:07,243
the distance between them is
zero, R two minus R one is zero.

649
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:10,352
So they will constructively
interfere.

650
00:47:10,352 --> 00:47:14,805
But there is another angle,
theta one, for which again

651
00:47:14,805 --> 00:47:18,196
there
will be constructive

652
00:47:18,196 --> 00:47:21,367
interference.
And you can confirm that I

653
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:25,107
found for these numbers that
theta one is about

654
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:29,01
seven-and-a-half degrees.
This is now for maxima.

655
00:47:29,01 --> 00:47:33,401
And so roughly at an angle
which is half that value you

656
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:36,979
will find silence.
Silence means that the two

657
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,581
radio waves will kill each
other.

658
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:44,541
Essential for the maximum to be
here is of course that the two

659
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:49,984
transmitters are in phase.
We could have rigged it up so

660
00:47:49,984 --> 00:47:54,177
that they were a hundred eighty
degrees out of phase in which

661
00:47:54,177 --> 00:47:56,414
case there would be silence
here.

662
00:47:56,414 --> 00:48:00,748
Silence in this case means that
the radar would kill the radar.

663
00:48:00,748 --> 00:48:04,033
But I do use the word silence
for a good reason,

664
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:08,087
because the way we rigged this
up is the same way we did it

665
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:10,673
before.
We modulate this ten-gigahertz

666
00:48:10,673 --> 00:48:13,539
signal with a thousand-hertz
audio signal.

667
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:15,846
We call that amplitude
modulation.

668
00:48:15,846 --> 00:48:20,261
And the receiver
which is here receives the

669
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:25,121
ten-gigahertz radiation which is
modulated at a thousand hertz.

670
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:29,51
We feed it to an amplifier.
We demodulate it and you will

671
00:48:29,51 --> 00:48:33,43
hear the thousand hertz.
And so we can also move it

672
00:48:33,43 --> 00:48:38,055
along this track here and find
the location X one whereby we

673
00:48:38,055 --> 00:48:41,347
have our first maximum apart
from the zero.

674
00:48:41,347 --> 00:48:45,893
And I found that that is very
roughly at fifteen point five

675
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:48,95
centimeters.
And you should confirm that

676
00:48:48,95 --> 00:48:52,102
using
those equations.

677
00:48:52,102 --> 00:48:57,091
Equations are the same.
Whether you deal with sound or

678
00:48:57,091 --> 00:49:02,55
with red laser light or with
gigahertz makes no difference.

679
00:49:02,55 --> 00:49:06,597
And so let's turn now to this
demonstration.

680
00:49:06,597 --> 00:49:11,962
I will turn on the -- the two
transmitters and here is the

681
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:16,198
receiver which is exactly at
angle theta zero.

682
00:49:16,198 --> 00:49:20,621
So there's a maximum.
I'm now going to close one

683
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:25,001
transmitter,
[tone] put my hand in front.

684
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:28,798
[tone] And you think about what
will be the reduction of

685
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:32,249
intensity of the sound here.
[tone] If I close one,

686
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:35,907
it's substantially down.
You may think that it is down

687
00:49:35,907 --> 00:49:38,875
by a factor of two.
Because we have only one

688
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,636
transmitter instead of two.
You're wrong.

689
00:49:41,636 --> 00:49:44,328
If you think that,
you do not understand

690
00:49:44,328 --> 00:49:47,227
interference.
It is four times lower when I

691
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:50,678
hold my hands over one.
Figure it out for yourself.

692
00:49:50,678 --> 00:49:54,199
I'll test you on the final to
see

693
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,646
whether you really understood
that.

694
00:49:56,646 --> 00:50:01,109
So now the sound is four times
larger than when I cover one up.

695
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:05,284
I'll cover the other one up.
It's down by a factor of four.

696
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:09,459
[tone] I can cover this one up
and then you hear nothing of

697
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:12,194
course.
[tone] Now I will move this one

698
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:16,153
[tone] to the location [tone]
where there is destructive

699
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:19,105
interference,
[tone] which should be about

700
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:21,768
half of fifteen point six
centimeters.

701
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:26,238
[tone] [cough]
Maybe you have good ears but I

702
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:29,893
hear nothing anymore.
Now I go through it and find

703
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:34,146
the maximum, which is about
fifteen point six centimeters.

704
00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:37,428
[tone] Here it is.
[tone] And the other side,

705
00:50:37,428 --> 00:50:41,532
[tone] here's the maximum at
center, so here should be a

706
00:50:41,532 --> 00:50:45,113
minimum, there it is,
and I go to the other side,

707
00:50:45,113 --> 00:50:48,768
there should be a maximum.
[tone] And there it is.

708
00:50:48,768 --> 00:50:54,215
[tone] So what I have shown you
today is I've shown you the

709
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:58,619
interference pattern of sound,
of water, of red laser light,

710
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:03,024
of radar, and at the very least
I hope I've convinced you as

711
00:51:03,024 --> 00:51:07,354
Young convinced the world in
eighteen oh one that light are

712
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:10,116
waves.
And that means that Huygens was

713
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:14,147
right and Newton was wrong.
Now that should perhaps not

714
00:51:14,147 --> 51:19
surprise you because Huygens was
Dutch.
