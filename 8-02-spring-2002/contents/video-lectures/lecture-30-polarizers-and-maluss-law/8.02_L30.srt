00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,84



2
00:00:00,84 --> 00:00:04,001
Earlier in this course,
we discussed linear

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:08,443
polarization of electromagnetic
radiation, and I demonstrate

4
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:12,282
this at seventy-five megaHertz
and at ten gigaHertz.

5
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:16,498
Today, I will concentrate
exclusively on the polarization

6
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:19,886
of light, which is at a much
higher frequency.

7
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,951
The light from the sun or light
from light bulbs is not

8
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:26,435
polarized.
So I can ask myself the

9
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:31,028
question, now,
what does it mean when light is

10
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:34,553
not polarized?
Let's think of individual light

11
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:38,626
photons as plane waves,
with a well-defined direction

12
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:41,682
of polarization.
So each one is linearly

13
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:44,737
polarized.
A beam is coming straight out

14
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:48,105
of the blackboard.
The first photon arrives,

15
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:51,317
it's linearly polarized in this
direction.

16
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:55,469
This second photon arrives,
linearly polarized in this

17
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,483
direction, so the electric field
vector is oscillating like that.

18
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:04,183
Another photon,
another photon,

19
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:07,445
and another photon.
And what you see here,

20
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:10,547
very clearly,
that there is no preferred

21
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:15,639
direction which you average over
time, and that's what we call --

22
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:19,219
call unpolarized light.
It was Edwin Land who,

23
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:23,515
in nineteen thirty eight,
developed a material that can

24
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:26,618
turn this into linearly
polarized light,

25
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:30,675
for which he became very
famous, in addition to this

26
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:35,29
demonstration that I showed you
last time.

27
00:01:35,29 --> 00:01:40,302
If I take one of Edwin Land's
sheets, which will turn light

28
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:45,142
into polarization in this
direction, and I first take one

29
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:47,735
photon, for instance,
this one.

30
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:51,97
That one comes in from the
blackboard towards you,

31
00:01:51,97 --> 00:01:56,032
and so here it is.
Oscillating the E vector like

32
00:01:56,032 --> 00:02:00,699
this, E zero is the maximum
value of the electric field

33
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:05,626
strength in that plane
electromagnetic wave.

34
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:11
And this is the direction of
the polarizer that I have

35
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16,475
through which this photon goes.
I can now make a simple

36
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:22,356
calculation, by projecting this
E-vector onto the preferred

37
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:27,831
direction of polarization,
and this new E-vector is now

38
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:33,003
down by the cosine of theta,
if this angle is theta,

39
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:40,101
this E-vector is now E -- E
zero times the cosine of theta.

40
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:43,887
If you ask me now,
whether the light is reduced in

41
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:48,677
intensity, I would have to say,
"Yes, of course," because light

42
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:51,768
intensity depends on the
pointing vector,

43
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:56,018
and the pointing vector is
always proportional to E zero

44
00:02:56,018 --> 00:03:00,345
squared, because the pointing
vector is the cross-product

45
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:03,126
between E and B.
And if E is reduced,

46
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:06,758
B is also reduced.
And so we get a cosine square

47
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:09,617
reduction.
If, now, I average over all

48
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:14,387
incoming photons --
so I take all of these,

49
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:19,489
which represent an unpolarized
beam -- so I get not only one

50
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,553
like so, but I get one like so,
and one like so,

51
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,925
and one like so,
and one like so -- then

52
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:31,94
clearly, I have to calculate,
now, the mean value of cosine

53
00:03:31,94 --> 00:03:35,485
square theta.
And the mean value of cosine

54
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:40,241
square theta is one-half,
and so if the intensity of the

55
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:43,526
unpolarized beam,
unpolarized light was

56
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:48,303
originally I
zero, once it comes through

57
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:53,538
this polarizer that Edwin Land
gave me, then I get one-half I

58
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:57,639
zero, but that is now hundred
percent polarized.

59
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,263
And it is hundred percent
polarized in this direction.

60
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:07,498
And the one-half is the result
of the average value of cosine

61
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,552
square theta.
If this were the case,

62
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:15,962
it would be an extremely ideal
polarizer, we would call this an

63
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:20,002
H N fifty
polarizer -- they don't exist,

64
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:23,866
it's only in your head -- and
the fifty refers to the fact

65
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:26,577
that fifty percent get through
polarized.

66
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:30,508
In the optic skits that we hand
out today that we will need

67
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:33,694
throughout this course,
you don't have H N fifty

68
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:37,625
polarizers, they don't exist.
I don't quite know what yours

69
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,014
is, I didn't measure it,
yours may be an H N twenty

70
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:45,014
five, or maybe an H N thirty,
which would then mean that the

71
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:48,538
I zero strength of an
unpolarized light of beam would

72
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:53,524
not be half of I zero,
but maybe only point two five,

73
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:55,874
or point three.
But in any case,

74
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:59,969
the light that will come
through your linear polarizers

75
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:03,76
will be very closely two hundred
percent polarized.

76
00:05:03,76 --> 00:05:07,702
So what I will do now,
I will take unpolarized light,

77
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:11,645
and I will have this light
coming straight out of the

78
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,663
blackboard perpendicular to you,
with strength I zero,

79
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:19,53
and here is one of my
polarizers, and the light that

80
00:05:19,53 --> 00:05:23,809
comes through
here is linearly polarized in

81
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:26,823
this direction.
And so we already know that

82
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:30,41
one-half I zero will come
through if it is an ideal

83
00:05:30,41 --> 00:05:33,854
polarizer, and it is polarized
in this direction.

84
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:36,652
I take a second sheet,
an identical one,

85
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,809
I put it also in the plane of
the blackboard,

86
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:42,32
but I rotate it over an angle
theta.

87
00:05:42,32 --> 00:05:46,697
So here is now a second sheet,
which has a preferred direction

88
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:50,715
of polarization in -- in this
direction, and the angle is

89
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:53,894
rotated over an
angle theta.

90
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:57,278
So between this one and this
one is an angle theta.

91
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:01,337
And so you can now immediately
tell what the intensity of the

92
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:04,653
light is that comes through this
second polarizer.

93
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:08,036
It must, of course,
be polarized in this direction,

94
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:11,961
because that is the allowed
direction polarization for that

95
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:15,682
second sheet -- and the
intensity must now be one-half I

96
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:19,877
zero, because that's what comes
in, and then I have to multiply

97
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:22,042
it by the cosine square of
theta.

98
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:27,086
I don't have to average it
now over all angles,

99
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:33,492
because there is only one value
of theta between this sheet and

100
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:38,038
this sheet, so this is now the
new intensity,

101
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,171
and it's all polarized in this
direction.

102
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:46,614
And this law,
whereby the light intensity is

103
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:50,85
reduced by the factor cosine
square theta,

104
00:06:50,85 --> 00:06:54,363
is known as Malus' Law.
Malus' Law.

105
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:57,359
If theta were thirty degrees,

106
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,632

107
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:04,103
the light intensity here would
be one-half I zero ties the

108
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:08,888
cosine square of thirty degrees,
which is oh point seven five.

109
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:13,28
If theta were zero degrees,
that means that this sheet is

110
00:07:13,28 --> 00:07:17,908
in the same direction as this
one, if everything were ideal,

111
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:21,829
one-half I zero would get
through the second sheet.

112
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:26,3
If theta is ninety degrees,
then nothing will get through,

113
00:07:26,3 --> 00:07:29,751
because the cosine of ninety
degrees is zero.

114
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:33,317
We call that crossed
polarizers.

115
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:37,344
If you cross them like this,
no light will get through.

116
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:41,818
Now, before I demonstrate this,
I have to be honest with you,

117
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:46,293
because the idea of reducing
the energy of individual photons

118
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:50,096
by reducing their electric field
strength, as I did,

119
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:52,408
is a cheat.
A light photon has a

120
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:55,988
well-defined energy which
depends uniquely on the

121
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:59,418
frequency of the light.
Blue light has a higher

122
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:03,222
frequency than red light,
so blue light has a higher

123
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,893
energy
than red light.

124
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,716
And when you send blue light
through a polarizer,

125
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,538
the way I did here,
it either comes through or it

126
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:14,419
doesn't come through.
But if it does come through,

127
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,359
it is still blue light,
there is no such thing as a

128
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,888
reduction in energy.
Whereas this reduction,

129
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:22,416
by cosine theta,
would imply that the energy

130
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,062
goes down, and that moo- would
imply, then, that there would be

131
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:28,473
a color change,
that it would no longer be

132
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,178
blue.
And that's not the case.

133
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:33,529
If you want to treat this
properly, you have to do it in a

134
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,356
quantum
mechanical way.

135
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:40,695
The interesting thing is that
if you use quantum mechanics,

136
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:44,809
you find exactly the same law,
you find also Malus' Law.

137
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:48,249
So the law is OK,
even though the derivation is

138
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:51,241
not kosher.
Now, I want you to get out of

139
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:55,43
your envelope one of your green
plates, which is a linear

140
00:08:55,43 --> 00:08:58,422
polarizer.
This is the kind of plate that

141
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:00,89
you have, you have three in
there.

142
00:09:00,89 --> 0.
Only take one out.

143
0. --> 00:09:02,311
If this light that comes in is
Ah, ready for this?
I want you to see two things.

144
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:08,09
These two lights shining
on me, unpolarized light.

145
00:09:08,09 --> 00:09:12,231
So the light that comes to you
now is unpolarized.

146
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:16,965
I'm now going to hold in front
of my face this polarizer.

147
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:22,036
So the light that comes through
is linearly polarized in this

148
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:25,333
direction.
And you are going to play the

149
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,968
role of the second polarizer.
Close one eye,

150
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:33,448
put the polarizer in front of
your eye, and rotate it.

151
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:38,265
And you will see a huge
difference in light

152
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:41,525
intensity.
If you cross-polarize with me,

153
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:45,68
then you can't see me.
That may make you very happy.

154
00:09:45,68 --> 00:09:48,695
But keep in mind,
if you can't see me,

155
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:50,977
then I can't see you,
either.

156
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:55,214
So rotate it around and
convince that this light that

157
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:58,962
reaches you is now,
indeed, linearly polarized,

158
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:03,688
and when you rotate around your
polarimeters -- we call the

159
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:07,192
polarimeters,
we call them polarizers -- you

160
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,953
can
see me either,

161
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:14,238
or you cannot see me at all,
and there is anything and

162
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,825
everything in between.
Very well.

163
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,352
There is a second way that we
can produce hundred percent

164
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:25,071
linearly polarized light,
and we can do that by

165
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:28,709
reflecting unpolarized light off
a dielectric.

166
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,972
For instance,
water or glass.

167
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:35,58
None of this follows from
Snell's Law, Snell's Law was two

168
00:10:35,58 --> 00:10:39,946
hundred fifty years before
Maxwell, polarization wasn't

169
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:43,708
even
known in the days of Snell.

170
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,675
But Maxwell's equations allow
you to properly deal with

171
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:51,568
refraction and reflection,
including the polarization.

172
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:55,902
And I will make no attempt to
derive this for you in detail,

173
00:10:55,902 --> 00:11:00,016
that's really part of eight oh
three if you ever take it,

174
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:04,276
but I will present you with
some results so that you can at

175
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:08,096
least appreciate the
far-reaching consequences of the

176
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:11,843
reflection in which we can
produce a hundred percent

177
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:16,257
polarized light.
Suppose I have unpolarized

178
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:20,383
light coming in here,
medium one, index of refraction

179
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:23,874
N one, medium two,
index of refraction N two.

180
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:27,683
It's coming in at an incident
angle of theta one,

181
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:31,413
it's unpolarized.
Some of it is reflected -- and

182
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:36,412
this angle is also theta one as
we discussed earlier -- and some

183
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:40,856
of it is refracted into this
medium, and this angle we'll

184
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:43,157
call theta two.
So this light,

185
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:47,998
unpolarized comes in,
reflects, and refracts.

186
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:52,177
If you want to use Maxwell's
equations, at the action,

187
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:56,435
where everything is happening
right here at the surface

188
00:11:56,435 --> 00:12:00,063
between the two,
you will have to decompose the

189
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:03,454
incoming light,
the electric field vector in

190
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:06,214
two directions.
And one direction is

191
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:10,63
perpendicular to the blackboard,
so this is the E-vector,

192
00:12:10,63 --> 00:12:14,099
and the other direction is in
the blackboard.

193
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:18,515
You will have to do the same
here, and you have to do the

194
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:22,307
same here.
And if you look at this

195
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,836
decomposition,
then notice that both

196
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:28,81
components -- this component,
as well as this component,

197
00:12:28,81 --> 00:12:32,279
is perpendicular to the
direction of propagation.

198
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,325
That is always a must with
traveling electric -- magnetic

199
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:38,349
waves.
You see the same here.

200
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:42,106
This component and this are
both perpendicular to the

201
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:45,141
reflected beam,
this component and this are

202
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:48,032
both perpendicular to the
refracted beam.

203
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:51,789
This one, the one perpendicular
to

204
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:54,615
the blackboard,
we normally give a symbol

205
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:57,44
perpendicular,
we call this the incidence

206
00:12:57,44 --> 00:13:01,537
plane, the plane through the
incident light and then normal

207
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:04,362
to the surface,
we call that the incident

208
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:08,6
plane, in this place -- in this
case, that is the blackboard.

209
00:13:08,6 --> 00:13:12,908
We call this the perpendicular
component, and we call this the

210
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,098
parallel component.
And this is,

211
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:18,771
of course, the incident beam.
So this one we call the

212
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:23,785
perpendicular component,
this one we call the parallel

213
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:27,562
component, and this is now of
the refracted beam.

214
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:31,969
This is the parallel component,
this is the perpendicular

215
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:36,454
component of the reflected beam.
The incident light is not

216
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:39,759
polarized in this sense.
So if you average,

217
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,929
there is no preferred direction
of the electric field.

218
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:47,47
That means, then,
that in this representation,

219
00:13:47,47 --> 00:13:51,719
the strength of this component
and the strength of this

220
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:58,006
component must be exactly equal,
because if one were stronger

221
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,385
than the other,
then it wouldn't be

222
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:03,463
unpolarized, then there would
be, on average,

223
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:07,102
a preferred direction.
So this component has the same

224
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:10,461
strength a that component for
the incoming light.

225
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:14,519
What Maxwell's equations now
can do for us -- it's a lot of

226
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,577
work, but you may see it in
eight oh three -- it can relate

227
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:22,286
the parallel component in
reflection with the parallel

228
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:25,644
component of incidence,
the parallel component of

229
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:29,761
refraction
with the parallel component of

230
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:34,005
incidence, it gives you two
relations, two -- two equations.

231
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:37,457
It can also relate the
perpendicular component of

232
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:40,621
reflection with this
perpendicular component,

233
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:44,505
and the perpendicular component
in refraction with this

234
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:47,095
component.
So you get four equations.

235
00:14:47,095 --> 0.

236
0. --> 00:14:49,324
If this light that comes in is
Ah, ready for this?
I want you to see two things.

237
00:14:49,324 --> 00:14:53,424
unpolarized, the strength of
this component is the same as

238
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:55,869
this one.
In general, you will see,

239
00:14:55,869 --> 00:15:00,113
if you apply these four
equations,

240
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:02,448
that that's no longer the case
here.

241
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:06,319
They're no longer the same
intensity, and they're no longer

242
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:09,989
the same intensity here.
That means this reflected light

243
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:13,86
and the refracted light has now
become partially polarized.

244
00:15:13,86 --> 00:15:17,263
I will only give you the
relation, one of those four

245
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:19,866
equations.
I will only address today the

246
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,468
parallel component of the
incident beam,

247
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:25,671
and the parallel component of
the reflected beam.

248
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:29,609
And I don't imagine that any
one of you will try to remember

249
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,922
that
equation.

250
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:35,9
I don't either,
I have to look it up every time

251
00:15:35,9 --> 00:15:39,791
that I deal with this.
So E zero, which always

252
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,769
represents, then,
the maximum possible value of

253
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:47,66
the electric field,
of the parallel component,

254
00:15:47,66 --> 00:15:52,157
of the reflected beam,
that's the one that I'm after,

255
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:56,221
I'm going to make polarized
light by reflecting,

256
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,805
is E zero, the parallel
component of the incident beam

257
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:06,08
times -- and this depends now on
the angle of

258
00:16:06,08 --> 00:16:11,665
incidence and on the indices of
refraction -- is going to be N

259
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:17,25
one times the cosine of theta
two minus N two times the cosine

260
00:16:17,25 --> 00:16:20,088
of theta one.
Believe it or not,

261
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:24,758
all of this follows from
Maxwell -- divided by N one

262
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:30,16
times the cosine of theta two
plus N two times the cosine of

263
00:16:30,16 --> 00:16:33,731
theta one.
And if you apply Snell's Law,

264
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:37,942
you can simplify this equation
--

265
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:43,537
in this case it will help us --
and so you get minus E zero

266
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:47,684
parallel incidence,
and now you get here the

267
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:51,253
tangent of theta one,
minus theta two,

268
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:56,076
divided by the tangent of theta
one plus theta two.

269
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:59,548
So these two equations are
identical.

270
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:05,528
Though that may not be obvious
to you, certainly not obvious to

271
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:09,094
me,
either, but if you substitute

272
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,651
Snell's Law in here,
you can show that these two are

273
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,161
the same.
Keep in mind if you're ever

274
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:19,485
interested in the intensity of
this light, then you must always

275
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:23,53
remember that the pointing
vector is proportional to E zero

276
00:17:23,53 --> 00:17:27,854
squared, so you always have to
square these numbers when you're

277
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:31,899
interested in light intensity.
This is just the strength of

278
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:34,968
the E-vector.
There is something very special

279
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:38,855
hidden in this equation,
and that is,

280
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:43,153
when theta one plus theta two
is ninety degrees,

281
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:47,177
then the downstairs here is
infinitely large.

282
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:52,482
And so that means that the
parallel component in reflection

283
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:56,049
is zero.
So E parallel in refection goes

284
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,432
to zero.
And if that one goes to zero,

285
00:17:59,432 --> 00:18:03,548
there is only this one left
which is not zero,

286
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:09,309
and that means the reflected
light is now hundred

287
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:13,182
percent polarized in this
direction, because I have killed

288
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:16,851
this component completely.
But it only works if this is

289
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:19,908
met, this condition.
If this condition is met,

290
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:23,101
that theta one plus theta two
is ninety degrees,

291
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,702
then it follows from high
school math that the sine of

292
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:29,487
theta two is then the cosine of
theta one.

293
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,729
That's immediately obvious,
right?

294
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:35,33
You remember the triangle,
theta one plus theta two is

295
00:18:35,33 --> 00:18:38,251
ninety degrees,
the sine of one angle is the

296
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,097
cosine
of the other.

297
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:46,569
And if now, I remember Snell's
Law, which says that the sine of

298
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:52,217
theta one divided by the sine of
theta two, if N two divided by N

299
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:56,63
one, I can replace now,
only for this special case,

300
00:18:56,63 --> 00:19:02,014
the sine of -- sine theta I can
replace by the cosine of theta

301
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:03,955
one.
And so I get here,

302
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:09,162
now, the tangent of theta one.
And so if this is the tangent

303
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:13,113
of
theta one, that is under these

304
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:18,189
conditions, then we have met the
condition that I was looking

305
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:23,011
for, that I end up with hundred
percent linearly polarized

306
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:25,887
light.
And so this is the secret to

307
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:29,186
getting hundred percent
polarized light.

308
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:32,824
And this angle is called the
Brewster angle.

309
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:35,024
And so if we,
for instance,

310
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:40,184
look at the transition from air
to glass, glass has a index of

311
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:44,414
refraction approximately one
point

312
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:49,144
five -- depends on the kind of
glass that you have -- if I go

313
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:52,848
from air to glass,
which is what I will do in my

314
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:56,317
demonstration,
then the tangent of this angle

315
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:59,47
is N two divided by N one,
this is glass,

316
00:19:59,47 --> 00:20:02,701
so this is one point five,
and one is one,

317
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,012
then you will find that the
Brewster angle,

318
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:10,268
theta Brewster turns out to be
about fifty six degrees.

319
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:14,131
I can also make linearly
polarized

320
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,641
light by going from glass to
air, by bouncing it off this

321
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:20,251
way.
Then, of course,

322
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:23,876
I have to invert this,
and then you will get a

323
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:28,789
Brewster angle which is smaller,
which is thirty-four degrees.

324
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,655
But since I will do it with --
from air to glass,

325
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:37,084
I want you to concentrate on
the fifty-six degree angle.

326
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:40,467
The way I'm going to do this
demonstration,

327
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:44,736
it's right set up here,
we have light,

328
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:48,684
a light beam that strikes a
piece of plane parallel glass.

329
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:51,871
That's all it is,
there's nothing special about

330
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:55,335
this piece of glass.
So the light comes in like so,

331
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:57,621
and here, I have a piece of
glass.

332
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,461
This is the angle of incidence,
theta one.

333
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:03,925
And so it's going to be
reflected in this direction

334
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:08,15
whereby this angle is also theta
one, and something will go in

335
00:21:08,15 --> 00:21:12,376
here, that is that angle theta
two, which I don't worry about,

336
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:15,979
because I want you to see that
this

337
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:18,348
can become hundred percent
polarized.

338
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:21,046
As this light comes in,
it is unpolarized,

339
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,535
this component and this
component have equal strength,

340
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:28,023
if theta one is fifty-six
degrees or somewhere in that

341
00:21:28,023 --> 00:21:31,511
vicinity, this light is now
hundred percent polarized.

342
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:34,473
And I'm going to project that
onto the screen,

343
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:37,632
and I'm going to convince you
that it is, indeed,

344
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:39,804
polarized.
You cannot use your own

345
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:43,292
polarizers to see that,
because the light in this beam

346
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:47,241
is going to be hundred percent
polarized.

347
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:51,233
However, once it reflects off
the screen, it no longer is,

348
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:55,015
so you cannot use your
polarimeter, so I have to use my

349
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,256
own polarimeter to show you
this.

350
00:21:57,256 --> 00:22:01,318
So if you can turn the light
off there, off the overhead --

351
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:05,45
thank you very much -- I will
turn on the -- the light of my

352
00:22:05,45 --> 00:22:09,162
light beam, there it is,
and I'm going to make it very

353
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:12,383
dark for you so that we can see
that very well.

354
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:16,025
So the light comes in this
direction, hits the glass,

355
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:19,946
and the angle of incidence is
now about

356
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:22,849
forty-five degrees.
I purposely didn't make it

357
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:25,429
fifty-six yet.
I have here a large set of

358
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,525
polarizer, one of Edwin Land's
polar- polarizers,

359
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:30,782
and I will rotate that in this
beam.

360
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,555
You will see that it is
partially polarized,

361
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:36,78
not yet hundred percent,
but it's already partially

362
00:22:36,78 --> 00:22:38,844
polarized.
So there is already an

363
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:42,133
imbalance between the
perpendicular and the parallel

364
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:44,584
component.
So if I hold it in the beam,

365
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:47,487
and I rotate it,
you will clearly see now that

366
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:51,747
it is much fainter than
-- than it is now.

367
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,987
And now I will go for the
fifty-six angle,

368
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:58,386
fifty-six degree angle,
roughly, and so now,

369
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:01,389
I rotate my polarizer,
and now, notice,

370
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:03,918
I can kill that light
completely.

371
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:06,605
Hundred percent linearly
polarized.

372
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:10,32
I may not have the angle
perfect, but that's OK,

373
00:23:10,32 --> 00:23:13,797
you get the idea.
It is very close to totally

374
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:15,931
dark.
Now you see the light,

375
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:19,962
it's polarized in this
direction, and now I can kill

376
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:22,412
it.
So that's quite a remarkable

377
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:27,133
thing,
that if we reflect light off a

378
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:32,066
dielectric, that we can -- at
one angle, and one angle only,

379
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:36,414
which is the Brewster angle,
that we can turn it into

380
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,759
hundred percent linearly
polarized light.

381
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,518
This does not apply to
conductors.

382
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:47,535
The behavior of conductors is
very different from dielectrics

383
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:50,378
such as -- such as water and
glass.

384
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:54,224
You can use Maxwell's
equations,

385
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,7
of course, to study the
reflection of electromagnetic

386
00:23:57,7 --> 00:24:00,708
waves off metals,
but you get a very different

387
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,914
result.
And so never expect to get

388
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:06,19
linearly polarized light which
bounces off metals.

389
00:24:06,19 --> 00:24:08,195
I have here,
for your pleasure,

390
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:10,936
a metal sphere,
and I have a glass sphere,

391
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:14,412
and if you still have your
linear polarizers at hand,

392
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:18,556
uh, you can now -- or a little
later -- just hold them in front

393
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:21,297
of your eyes,
and rotate them around -- of

394
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:26,176
course, you're not seeing light
at the Brewster angle,

395
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:30,47
the chances are that some of
the light that's reflected off

396
00:24:30,47 --> 00:24:34,541
this glass that you can clearly
see that it is partially

397
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:37,28
polarized.
You can see a difference in

398
00:24:37,28 --> 00:24:39,649
light intensity as you rotate
it.

399
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:42,832
You're not going to see that
off this metal.

400
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:45,942
Now, I come to a third way of
polarization.

401
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,791
There is a third way that we
can make hundred percent

402
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:53,788
polarized light by the
scattering of unpolarized light,

403
00:24:53,788 --> 00:24:58,609
and we have to scatter it off
very fine particles,

404
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:02,928
preferably a tenth of a micron.
Dust particles would work very

405
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,981
well.
Now, the theory of light

406
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:08,804
scattering is extremely
complicated, but I will be able

407
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:12,769
to convince you that if I
scatter the light over an angle

408
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:15,955
of ninety degrees -- so it comes
in like this,

409
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:19,99
and it scatters over an angle
of ninety degrees -- that it

410
00:25:19,99 --> 00:25:22,964
becomes hundred percent linearly
polarized.

411
00:25:22,964 --> 00:25:25,158
I will stay on the center
board.

412
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:28,911
Suppose I have light coming in
like

413
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:31,246
so.
And I have one light photon,

414
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:35,766
I concentrate on one to start
with, and it happens to be that

415
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:40,061
that light photon is linearly
polarized in this direction,

416
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:43,375
and so the E-vector is
oscillating like this.

417
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,368
Later, we're going to add all
directions that we want.

418
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:50,909
I just picked one now.
And here are my find dust

419
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:54,676
particles, and these dust
particles have electrons,

420
00:25:54,676 --> 00:25:58,292
and the electric field passes
by,

421
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,656
and these electrons,
which are charged,

422
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:03,144
are going to oscillate in this
direction.

423
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,818
They're going to experience an
acceleration,

424
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:09,301
which is the force that they
experience, divided by their

425
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,287
mass, and therefore,
that is the charge that they

426
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:15,583
have, times the electric field,
divided by their mass.

427
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:19,066
And so as this electric field
vector, this electric field

428
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,865
component, oscillating with
frequencies omega,

429
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:25,473
is passing by these electrons,
they themselves are going to

430
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:30,519
oscillate with frequency omega,
and this is the force that they

431
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:33,267
will experience.
Uh, this is the acceleration

432
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:36,452
they will experience.
Notice that the electrons will

433
00:26:36,452 --> 00:26:39,763
experience a way higher
acceleration than the protons,

434
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:43,385
because the protons have a mass
which is more than eighteen

435
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:45,759
hundred times larger than the
electron.

436
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,882
So whatever follows,
it's really the electrons that

437
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:52,629
do the job and not the protons.
So, we have charges that move

438
00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:56,502
up and down, and now comes the
question which we have discussed

439
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:59,959
earlier,
so this is just simply to

440
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:03,333
refresh your memory,
if you're here at point P,

441
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:07,66
in what direction will you now
see electromagnetic radiation

442
00:27:07,66 --> 00:27:11,621
that is produced by charges that
are being accelerated?

443
00:27:11,621 --> 00:27:15,655
We discussed that earlier,
and we even had a movie about

444
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:18,148
that.
And perhaps you will remember

445
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:22,109
that the electric field,
at point P, is now oscillating

446
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:25,336
in this direction.
A spherical wave goes out,

447
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:30,699
if I accelerate charges here.
And the rules about this

448
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:34,737
direction of the electric field
are very simple.

449
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:39,635
E is always perpendicular to
the direction of propagation,

450
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:44,962
which is the position vector --
I call this the position vector

451
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:50,031
R -- and the second rule is that
A R and E are in one plane,

452
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:53,125
and that happens to be,
in this case,

453
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,647
the plane of my blackboard.
But of course,

454
00:27:56,647 --> 00:28:01,892
that doesn't have to be
the plane of the blackboard,

455
00:28:01,892 --> 00:28:06,318
because I can choose my point P
in space here and these rules

456
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,679
still apply.
The incident photon,

457
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,408
which in this case,
I picked only one,

458
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:15,17
is completely destroyed.
It is absorbed by the dust.

459
00:28:15,17 --> 00:28:18,416
And the electrons which are
going to radiate,

460
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:21,957
reradiate a photon at exactly
the same frequency,

461
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:26,309
because if this is oscillating
with angular frequency omega,

462
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:31,915
then the acceleration would be
with angular frequency omega,

463
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:35,658
and so this E field will have
angular frequency omega.

464
00:28:35,658 --> 00:28:39,683
So it really is as if the
photon comes in and takes off in

465
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:42,861
a different direction,
that's why we call this

466
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:45,615
scattering.
So the frequency remains the

467
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:49,711
same, but the direction changes.
And the probably that that

468
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:53,807
photon will go in this direction
or this direction is zero,

469
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:57,408
because you remember that no
electromagnetic wave is

470
00:28:57,408 --> 00:29:00,727
propagated in the direction of
the acceleration,

471
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:04,328
there's a high probability that
it

472
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:07,814
goes out in this plane,
perpendicular to A,

473
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:12,047
and at this angle theta,
the probability is a little

474
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:14,702
lower.
We discussed that earlier.

475
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:19,516
Now, I'm going to convince you
why light that scatters over

476
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:24,329
ninety degrees that comes in
like this, and then [wssshhht]

477
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,649
comes to you,
why that is hundred percent

478
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:31,217
linearly polarized.
Here is a beam of light.

479
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:35,615
And this beam of light is
unpolarized.

480
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:39,564
That means, if I look down on
this beam, you have individual

481
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:43,512
photons, and I described through
those -- maybe a little bit

482
00:29:43,512 --> 00:29:45,653
artificially,
but I will do that,

483
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:49,668
it was successful with Malus'
Law -- I describe through them,

484
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:52,145
individual directions of
polarization.

485
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:54,888
So each photon,
on its own, has a uniquely

486
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:57,097
defined direction of
polarization.

487
00:29:57,097 --> 00:30:00,978
It is a picture that is not
kosher, you really need quantum

488
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:04,257
mechanics to do this right,
but on the other hand,

489
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:08,054
the result
that you find is probably

490
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:10,802
correct.
You will find the same result

491
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:13,847
if you did it in a quantum
mechanical way.

492
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:18,229
So here, you have these dust
particles, and so what is going

493
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:20,68
to happen is,
this light comes in,

494
00:30:20,68 --> 00:30:24,245
and then [wssshhht],
one may be scattered in this

495
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:28,107
direction, [wssshhht],
another one in this direction,

496
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:30,483
another one in forward
direction.

497
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:33,9
And you can go in all
directions as you please.

498
00:30:33,9 --> 00:30:37,761
I'm now going to look in the
plane

499
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:40,899
perpendicular to the
blackboard, because in the plane

500
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:44,699
perpendicular to the blackboard,
every photon that ends up there

501
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:47,715
is at ninety degrees angles.
It comes in like this,

502
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,491
that is ninety degrees,
this is ninety degrees,

503
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:53,567
this is also ninety degrees.
And here is that plane.

504
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:56,523
I just draw a circle,
but there is nothing special

505
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,178
about the circle.
And so the photons come now

506
00:30:59,178 --> 00:31:01,349
straight to you,
perpendicular to the

507
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:03,823
blackboard.
That's the picture that I have

508
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:07,08
now in mind.
And let's say you were

509
00:31:07,08 --> 00:31:09,557
looking here.
So you were sitting there,

510
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:13,303
so you have to lift this up,
so you're really sitting there.

511
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:16,796
So this is where you are.
And let's take one photon that

512
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:20,288
comes in, which happens to be
linearly polarized in this

513
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:22,13
direction.
We pick one photon,

514
00:31:22,13 --> 00:31:25,622
but it's unpolarized light
because we're going to add so

515
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:28,226
many photons that,
on average, there is no

516
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:31,337
preferred direction.
But I pick one to start with.

517
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:34,576
And now I ask myself the
question, if that photon is

518
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:37,497
scattered in your direction,
in this direction,

519
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:41,056
how is the E-vector
oscillating here?

520
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,175
So this is now the position
vector R, and this is the

521
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:47,354
direction A in which the
electrons are going to shake,

522
00:31:47,354 --> 00:31:50,712
because the photon comes in,
with an E field shaking like

523
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:53,771
this, so the electrons are going
to shake like this.

524
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:56,77
And you will immediately
conclude that the electric

525
00:31:56,77 --> 00:31:59,229
vector here must be oscillating
like this.

526
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:00,669
Why?
Because it has to be

527
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,528
perpendicular to R,
which it is,

528
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:04,927
and it has to be in the plane
of A and R.

529
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:08,166
There's only one solution,
and then this is the correct

530
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:11,224
solution.
Now there is a next

531
00:32:11,224 --> 00:32:14,314
photon coming in.
And the next photon -- I will

532
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:17,268
give it color,
just to distinguish the two --

533
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,156
happens to be oscillating in
this direction.

534
00:32:20,156 --> 00:32:24,185
And I ask myself the question,
if that photon is scattered in

535
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:26,805
your direction,
in what direction is the

536
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:30,162
E-field oscillating?
And you'll come to exactly the

537
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:32,446
same conclusion,
in this direction.

538
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:34,057
Why?
Because it has to be

539
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:36,139
perpendicular to R,
which it is,

540
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:40,37
and it has to be in the plane A
and R, that's the only solution.

541
00:32:40,37 --> 00:32:44,734
A little later,
there is another photon that

542
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:47,166
comes in.
How is that electric field

543
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,572
being observed here?
Of course, in this direction.

544
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:54,256
And so, no matter how they come
in, unpolarized light,

545
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:58,565
you will always see that if the
photon is scattered over ninety

546
00:32:58,565 --> 00:33:02,666
degrees, you will always see it
polarized in this direction,

547
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,377
and therefore,
you have created linearly

548
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:07,948
polarized light.
So if you watch here,

549
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:11,91
that is at ninety degrees angle
-- or if you watch here at

550
00:33:11,91 --> 00:33:15,795
ninety degrees angles --
but of course,

551
00:33:15,795 --> 00:33:19,725
it's a whole plane -- then you
end up with hundred percent

552
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:23,242
linearly polarized light.
If you go through the same

553
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:25,379
exercise, say,
at an angle here,

554
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,137
of forty five degrees,
and you look here,

555
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:32,275
it's only partially polarized.
Indeed, if you rotate in front

556
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:35,998
of your eye the polarimeter,
you will see clearly light

557
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:38,825
intensity changes.
But not hundred percent

558
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:41,238
polarized.
You couldn't turn it into

559
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:43,859
darkness.
And if you look from above --

560
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:47,276
and
you may want to go through that

561
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:50,171
exercise for yourself,
you will see that the light

562
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:53,833
remains completely unpolarized.
So it is only the ninety-degree

563
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:57,083
angle that is very special.
And that's what I'm going to

564
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,977
demonstrate to you.
But before I demonstrate this,

565
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:03,581
there is something that I have
to tell you, that I cannot hide

566
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:05,767
from you, I wish I could,
but I can't.

567
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:08,957
It's not something that is my
goal during this lecture,

568
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:11,202
it has nothing to do with
polarization.

569
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:13,624
But that's the fact,
that the probability,

570
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:17,077
when you
scatter light off very small

571
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:20,416
particles, a tenth of a micron
or so, dust particles,

572
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,691
that the probability of
scattering is way higher for

573
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:26,003
blue light than it is for blue
light.

574
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:29,47
The shorter the wavelength,
the higher the probability.

575
00:34:29,47 --> 00:34:32,874
If you ever take eight of
three, you're going to see a

576
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:35,764
derivation of that,
a quantitative derivation.

577
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:38,974
Blue light has a ten times
higher probability to be

578
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:42,571
scattered than red light.
And so whenever I'm going to do

579
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:46,681
my scatter experiments on very
fine particles,

580
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:49,99
you will see that that light is
going to be bluish.

581
00:34:49,99 --> 00:34:53,367
You can't miss that.
Now, if the particles off which

582
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:56,346
I scatter are larger than a
tenth of a micron,

583
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,861
say one micron,
this effect of color on

584
00:34:58,861 --> 00:35:01,708
probability of scattering is
highly reduced,

585
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:05,746
and if I scatter off very large
particles -- ten microns or so

586
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:08,791
-- then there is no dependence
any more at all.

587
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:12,763
And in this lies the secret why
the sky is blue -- I will get

588
00:35:12,763 --> 00:35:17,992
back to that later today -- the
reason why cigarette smoke can

589
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,918
be blue, if the smoke particles
are very small,

590
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,461
and it's the reason why clouds
are white.

591
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:27,022
Because the sunlight hits the
clouds, the light scatters,

592
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:30,392
but the water drops in the
clouds are not oh point one

593
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:33,953
microns, but they are much
larger, they are more like ten

594
00:35:33,953 --> 00:35:36,688
microns and up,
and so there is no preferred

595
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:40,121
wavelength that scatters,
and so the clouds look white.

596
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:43,937
And so the first demonstration
that I want to do is very much

597
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:47,243
like what you see here.
I'm going to send unpolarized

598
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:50,168
light up here,
straight up.

599
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:53,926
We have bright spotlights,
and the light goes straight up.

600
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:57,289
In here, I'm going to put very
small dust particles.

601
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:01,179
And I have decided to do that
smoke, simply cigarette smoke.

602
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:04,541
So I'm going to hold cigarette
smoke in these beams,

603
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:08,497
and the light that will come to
you, no matter where you sit,

604
00:36:08,497 --> 00:36:11,596
must have scattered closely
over ninety degrees,

605
00:36:11,596 --> 00:36:13,442
right?
It comes up like this,

606
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:16,343
but if you see it,
almost for everyone in the

607
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:20,166
audience, ninety degree angle
scattering.

608
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:27,689
So with your linear polarizers,
you will be able to see that

609
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:34,574
that light is polarized,
and it's going to be polarized

610
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:40,567
in this direction,
which is the direction that I

611
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:45,667
have here.
And that's the first thing I'm

612
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:50,129
going to do with this
demonstration.

613
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:55,484
And so I need cigarettes,
and I need smoke.

614
00:36:55,484 --> 0.
As much as I hate this.

615
0. --> 00:36:58,544
If this light that comes in is
Ah, ready for this?
I want you to see two things.

616
00:36:58,544 --> 00:37:00,329
[laughter].
OK.

617
00:37:00,329 --> 0.
That should do.

618
0. --> 00:37:06,449
If this light that comes in is
Ah, ready for this?
I want you to see two things.

619
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:10,191
[laughter].
OK.

620
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:22,754
So, you need a lot of light,
and as light comes,

621
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:32,911
presumably from here  yes,
there it is.

622
00:37:32,911 --> 0.

623
0. --> 00:37:44,137
If this light that comes in is
Ah, ready for this?
I want you to see two things.

624
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,27
OK, so have your polarizers
ready.

625
00:37:48,27 --> 0.

626
0. --> 00:37:52,027
If this light that comes in is
Ah, ready for this?
I want you to see two things.

627
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:58,539
Number one, that the light is
bluish, and number two,

628
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:04,175
that it is polarized.
Take your time for that.

629
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:11,064
If you don't see it as blue,
then the reason for that is

630
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:19,565
that at low-light intensities,
your eyes are not very

631
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:26,016
sensitive for color any more.
It looks quite bluish to me,

632
00:38:26,016 --> 0.
though.

633
0. --> 00:38:26,922
If this light that comes in is
Ah, ready for this?
I want you to see two things.

634
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:31,223
Now I want to do something in
addition.

635
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:36,429
I mentioned that if the
particles grow in size,

636
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:42,54
that the scattering is no
longer preferred in the blue.

637
00:38:42,54 --> 00:38:50,424
And I can demonstrate that.
I can kill two birds with one

638
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:53,84
stone.
What I can do is I can hold the

639
00:38:53,84 --> 00:38:58,365
smoke in my lungs for a while,
and when I do that,

640
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:03,72
the  the water vapor in my
lungs  will precipitate on these

641
00:39:03,72 --> 00:39:07,875
dust particles,
and they will form small water

642
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,737
drops.
And when I puff that out,

643
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:15,815
you will see a distinct
difference in color between what

644
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:21,686
you see now, and
the smoke that comes out of my

645
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:25,061
lungs when the particles are ten
microns and even larger.

646
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:27,23
You will see,
then, that the light is

647
00:39:27,23 --> 00:39:29,581
whitish.
So this is -- this comes extra,

648
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:31,57
over and above,
it comes for free.

649
00:39:31,57 --> 00:39:34,945
In order to make you see the
difference, shortly before I

650
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:38,139
puff out the smoke in here,
I will again show you this

651
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:41,092
smoke as it is now,
so you can compare the colors,

652
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:43,684
and you will see that there is
a difference.

653
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:47,24
Even though this doesn't --
this may not look very bluish to

654
00:39:47,24 --> 00:39:50,494
you, for reasons that I
mentioned,

655
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:57,54
in darkness,
you don't have a very good

656
00:39:57,54 --> 00:40:06,996
sensitive for color.
So I'm going to hold this smoke

657
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:16,637
now -- as much as I hate it,
this is one of the worst

658
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:28,133
demonstrations that I have to do
-- I hold it in my lungs for a

659
00:40:28,133 --> 0.
while.

660
0. --> 00:40:32,583
If this light that comes in is
Ah, ready for this?
I want you to see two things.

661
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:37,605
I see a huge difference,
but I'm very close.

662
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:44,263
The second puff [huh] [whew]
was very wide compared to the

663
00:40:44,263 --> 00:40:48,702
first one.
So we were able to catch two

664
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:55,36
birds with one stone here.
The sky is blue because of this

665
00:40:55,36 --> 00:40:59,215
phenomenon.
Here, you are standing

666
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:06,139
innocently on the Earth.
And sunlight is coming in,

667
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:09,43
onto the Earth's atmosphere.
The sun is there.

668
00:41:09,43 --> 00:41:12,428
Sunlight comes in,
and the light scatters.

669
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:16,377
And the light that reaches you,
that scatters off these

670
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:20,618
extremely fine dust particles,
and it also scatters off the

671
00:41:20,618 --> 00:41:24,64
air molecules themselves.
There are thermal fluctuations

672
00:41:24,64 --> 00:41:27,858
that go on all the time,
which causes density

673
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:31,807
fluctuations in the air,
and they are sufficient to act

674
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:36,062
as scatterers.
And so if light from here comes

675
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:40,253
to you, the chances are that it
is blue, because it has a higher

676
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:43,578
probability than red.
And this is also likely to be

677
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:45,707
blue.
And so when you look at the

678
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:48,5
sky, the sky looks blue,
that's the reason,

679
00:41:48,5 --> 00:41:52,158
it has to do with this strong
preference for color to be

680
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:56,348
scattered when it is blue light.
If you look in the direction of

681
00:41:56,348 --> 00:42:00,339
the sky at an angle of ninety
degrees to the direction of the

682
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:04,263
sun, the sky is also linearly
polarized for the reasons that

683
00:42:04,263 --> 00:42:07,603
we now
understand, because there is

684
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:11,151
scattering over ninety degrees.
And so when the sun is out

685
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:14,948
there, there is always a whole
plane, great circle in the sky,

686
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:17,501
which is ninety degrees away
from the sun.

687
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,426
So when you come out with your
linear polarizes,

688
00:42:20,426 --> 00:42:23,29
as soon as the weather clears,
look at the sky,

689
00:42:23,29 --> 00:42:26,029
at the blue sky,
and look ninety degrees away

690
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:28,644
from the sun,
and you will see that the sky

691
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:32,254
is very strongly polarized.
If you look at angles different

692
00:42:32,254 --> 00:42:36,239
from ninety degrees,
it's partially polarized.

693
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,093
But not as strongly polarized
as it is at ninety degrees.

694
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:42,778
So this explains,
in a very natural way,

695
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:44,567
why the sun,
when it rises,

696
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:46,563
and why the sun,
when it sets,

697
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:50,005
why the sun is red.
Because if the sun rises or the

698
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:52,552
sun sets, the sun is near the
horizon.

699
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:55,168
So now the sunlight comes in
like this.

700
00:42:55,168 --> 00:42:58,747
Imagine how much atmosphere it
has to travel through,

701
00:42:58,747 --> 00:43:02,739
how many scattering particles
it will encounter on the way.

702
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,731
And so, right here there is
scattering.

703
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:08,77
That is blue light,
that is blue light,

704
00:43:08,77 --> 00:43:10,809
that is blue light,
that is blue light,

705
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:13,438
that has a higher probability,
that is blue light.

706
00:43:13,438 --> 00:43:15,638
So what do you think is left
over for you?

707
00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:17,301
There isn't very much left
over.

708
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:19,179
What is left over,
the blue is gone,

709
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,593
the green is gone,
so if there's anything left

710
00:43:21,593 --> 00:43:24,007
over, it is red.
And it is that red light that

711
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:25,939
you see.
That's why the sun looks red

712
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,3
when it sets,
and it looks red when it rises,

713
00:43:28,3 --> 00:43:30,768
the same is true for planets,
and bright stars,

714
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:32,914
and the moon.
When they're just above the

715
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:36,347
horizon, they look very reddish.
And if

716
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:39,288
there happens to be a cloud
here in the sky,

717
00:43:39,288 --> 00:43:42,296
well, the cloud will also see
that red light,

718
00:43:42,296 --> 00:43:45,989
so you get a red cloud.
And that's exactly what you see

719
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:48,45
at sunset, all these clouds turn
red.

720
00:43:48,45 --> 00:43:51,459
And so that is,
again, the consequence of the

721
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:55,493
fact that the probability for
light scattering of blue light

722
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:58,775
is ten times larger,
roughly, that the scattering

723
00:43:58,775 --> 00:44:01,647
for red light.
So it explains both the blue

724
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:05,613
skies and the reason why the sky
-- why the sunrise and the

725
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:10,331
sunsets are -- are red.
I can show you two slides,

726
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:14,424
whereby you do see this
phenomenon, that light that

727
00:44:14,424 --> 00:44:19,172
scatters to you becomes bluish.
We can see it in astronomy,

728
00:44:19,172 --> 00:44:23,101
and the first slide is a
picture of the Pleiades,

729
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:26,375
called the Seven Sisters,
very hot stars,

730
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:29,977
they are surrounded by very
small, fine dust,

731
00:44:29,977 --> 00:44:34,889
and the light that reaches you
is not only polarized -- which

732
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:38,573
you cannot see,
of course, on the slide -- but

733
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:42,903
it's also bluish.
And so let's take a look at

734
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:45,437
that first.
So here you see the Pleiades,

735
00:44:45,437 --> 00:44:49,175
it's called the Seven Sisters
-- some people think there are

736
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:52,659
only seven stars in there,
but there are hundreds -- and

737
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:56,587
you see here these very bright
stars, and here you see the dust

738
00:44:56,587 --> 00:44:59,881
surrounding these stars,
and this is distinctly blue.

739
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:02,985
That's the effect,
the fact that short wavelengths

740
00:45:02,985 --> 00:45:06,976
have a higher probability to be
scattered than long wavelengths.

741
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:10,081
So the blue has a higher
probability than the red.

742
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:14,199
And the next slide shows you a
man on the moon.

743
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:18,844
And this person is walking on
the moon, but as he walks on the

744
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:21,814
moon, he produces dust,
by just walking,

745
00:45:21,814 --> 00:45:26,003
very fine dust particles that
come from the soil that he

746
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:28,364
brings up.
And what he is doing,

747
00:45:28,364 --> 00:45:32,552
he is creating around himself
sort of a blue atmosphere,

748
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:36,589
a blue sky, because the
sunlight comes from the right,

749
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:41,158
and so the light that you see
that comes in your direction is

750
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:43,138
being scattered,
of course.

751
00:45:43,138 --> 00:45:47,175
Because there is no air on the
moon,

752
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:50,812
so that can only be the dust
that he has produced,

753
00:45:50,812 --> 00:45:53,336
and you see that that dust is
blue.

754
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:56,603
It would probably also be
strongly polarized,

755
00:45:56,603 --> 00:45:59,721
because if it changes ninety
degrees angle,

756
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:02,765
then, of course,
it would also be strongly

757
00:46:02,765 --> 00:46:04,843
polarized.
Now I want to do a

758
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:06,848
demonstration,
the last one,

759
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,411
which catches more than two
birds with one stone,

760
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:14,123
it's going to kill three.
I have here a bucket with

761
00:46:14,123 --> 00:46:17,241
thiosulfate.
And we have lights coming from

762
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:22,006
this side which we s-
shine through that bucket.

763
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:25,869
And we're going to put a little
bit of sulfuric acid in there,

764
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:28,655
and when we do that,
sulfur will precipitate,

765
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:32,264
small particles of sulfur.
These small particles of sulfur

766
00:46:32,264 --> 00:46:35,114
will become the scatterers,
and so this light,

767
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:38,597
which is unpolarized white
light, will begin to scatter.

768
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:41,953
And you're going to see it.
If you're sitting at right

769
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:45,246
angles, then you will see that
that light is linearly

770
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:48,665
polarized, you can enjoy that.
If you're sitting there,

771
00:46:48,665 --> 00:46:52,973
you're not so well off,
because then the light is not

772
00:46:52,973 --> 00:46:55,746
at ninety degrees.
But you will see it partially

773
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,752
polarized.
If you're sitting there,

774
00:46:57,752 --> 00:47:00,643
it's not at ninety degrees
either, you will see it

775
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:03,593
partially polarized.
But you will also see it blue,

776
00:47:03,593 --> 00:47:07,016
because the probability that
blue light scattered is higher

777
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:09,258
than red light.
So you're going to see,

778
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:12,739
slowly in front of your eye,
a blue sky is going to develop.

779
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:16,338
It's going to be polarized in
the vertical direction for those

780
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:19,996
people who are sitting at right
angles, partially polarized for

781
00:47:19,996 --> 00:47:23,03
the rest of
the audience,

782
00:47:23,03 --> 00:47:28,867
and then we're going to look at
the light that remains after the

783
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:32,11
light had penetrated the
atmosphere.

784
00:47:32,11 --> 00:47:35,817
After the blue light is slowly
exhausted.

785
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:39,338
All right.
I will also take a polarizer

786
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:44,434
with me, so I can also show you,
then, the polarization.

787
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:47,955
Let me first put that sulfuric
acid in.

788
00:47:47,955 --> 00:47:54,163
I will do that now,
so that I know that I  OK.

789
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:58,57
So very slowly am I creating,
now, my own atmosphere.

790
00:47:58,57 --> 00:48:01,961
And I'm going to make it
completely dark.

791
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:06,623
And so you see white light,
keep an eye on the -- on the

792
00:48:06,623 --> 00:48:11,2
bucket, the bucket cannot be
seen by all of us so well,

793
00:48:11,2 --> 00:48:14,93
depending upon where you sit in
the audience,

794
00:48:14,93 --> 00:48:20,1
but I can already begin to see
that it turned slightly bluish.

795
00:48:20,1 --> 00:48:24,253
Of course, I have -- I'm very
close.

796
00:48:24,253 --> 00:48:27,393
I admit I'm very close,
which is very good.

797
00:48:27,393 --> 00:48:31,132
It's slightly bluish,
more and more sulfur is going

798
00:48:31,132 --> 00:48:35,094
to precipitate as time goes on,
we have to be patient.

799
00:48:35,094 --> 00:48:38,533
Oh, boy, it's bluish.
I will show you that it's

800
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:41,523
polarized.
I will rotate in front of it a

801
00:48:41,523 --> 00:48:45,71
polarimeter, and you see,
there's a distinct polarization

802
00:48:45,71 --> 00:48:48,626
of this light,
if it comes out at ninety

803
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,943
degrees.
More and more sulfur is

804
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:54,158
precipitating,
and look at the sun -- if you

805
00:48:54,158 --> 00:48:58,504
think of this as the sun.
The sun is, um,

806
00:48:58,504 --> 00:49:02,518
is getting a little yellowish,
it's not so white any more.

807
00:49:02,518 --> 00:49:05,757
And you wonder why.
Well, you should be able to

808
00:49:05,757 --> 00:49:08,714
answer that, now.
Because the light that is

809
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:13,08
scattered in the atmosphere -- I
call this the atmosphere -- is

810
00:49:13,08 --> 00:49:15,333
blue.
It has a higher probability

811
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:18,15
than red.
And so what is left over in the

812
00:49:18,15 --> 00:49:22,234
direction that you see on the
screen there is the remaining

813
00:49:22,234 --> 00:49:24,417
light.
And the more blue leaves,

814
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:29,671
and the more green leaves,
the redder the sun is going to

815
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:31,754
be.
And if we're going to be a

816
00:49:31,754 --> 00:49:36,064
little bit more patient -- and
we certainly have the time for

817
00:49:36,064 --> 00:49:40,303
that -- you're going to see the
sun getting pretty -- pretty

818
00:49:40,303 --> 00:49:42,602
bloody red.
So keep an eye on it,

819
00:49:42,602 --> 00:49:46,337
also have your linear
polarizers, and try to see that

820
00:49:46,337 --> 00:49:50,863
the light that comes to you from
the atmosphere -- if you are at

821
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:54,527
ninety degree angles,
I will once more do it with my

822
00:49:54,527 --> 00:49:58,813
polarizers -- that that's
strongly polarized.

823
00:49:58,813 --> 00:50:01,987
Oh, boy, look at the sun.
We're getting close,

824
00:50:01,987 --> 00:50:03,75
we're getting close.
Whew.

825
00:50:03,75 --> 00:50:06,994
Imagine you're now on the
beach, very romantic,

826
00:50:06,994 --> 00:50:09,957
and there is the sun,
you're with a friend,

827
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:13,131
you don't have your polari-
well, from now on,

828
00:50:13,131 --> 00:50:16,375
you should always have your
polarizer with you,

829
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,985
of course.
You can really impress your

830
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:21,313
friend, believe me.
For one thing,

831
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:25,686
you can point out that the sky
at ninety-degree angles from the

832
00:50:25,686 --> 00:50:29,365
sun is
nearly a hundred percent

833
00:50:29,365 --> 00:50:32,364
polarized.
You can even tell your friend

834
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:35,901
why the sky is blue.
And as you experience this

835
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:39,284
romantic sunset,
you can also explain why the

836
00:50:39,284 --> 00:50:43,052
sun is getting red,
because all that blue light --

837
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:46,897
and the green light -- gets out
first, and this is,

838
00:50:46,897 --> 00:50:51,126
then, what is left over.
And the sun is really beautiful

839
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:55,047
now, I already feel these
butterflies in my stomach,

840
00:50:55,047 --> 00:50:58,584
and ants in my pants,
this is sunset all right?

841
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:01,766
[sniffles]
This is very,

842
00:51:01,766 --> 00:51:03,745
very nice sunset.
Oh, man.

843
00:51:03,745 --> 00:51:06,594
What a beautiful sunset.
Yes, indeed,

844
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:09,205
indeed!
We are approaching sunset!

845
00:51:09,205 --> 51:14
OK, see you Wednesday.
[applause]
