00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,641



2
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:05,285
All of you have looked at
rainbows, but very few of you

3
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:09,327
have ever seen one.
Looking at something is very

4
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:13,971
different from seeing it.
And today I will make you see

5
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:19,046
the rainbow in a way that goes
way beyond the beauty that we

6
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:22,916
can all experience,
a way that you will always

7
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,84
remember.
And I would like to start

8
00:00:25,84 --> 00:00:30,312
asking you fifteen perhaps
simple questions about the

9
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:34,308
rainbow.
The first question then is

10
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:39,041
would any one of you remember if
you see a bow whether the red

11
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:43,541
color is outside or whether the
-- the red color is inside?

12
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,033
And then I wonder about the
radius of the bow.

13
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:50,757
If this is a bow in the sky,
something like this,

14
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:54,637
here is the horizon,
it's clearly a perfect circle,

15
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:58,361
and so the perfect circle has
somewhere a center.

16
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:01,62
And so that means there must be
a radius R.

17
00:01:01,62 --> 00:01:06,14
You can measure that
radius in terms of how many

18
00:01:06,14 --> 00:01:08,825
degrees and so what is roughly
that radius.

19
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:11,765
You've never measured it but is
it ten degrees,

20
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:13,491
is it twenty,
thirty, fifty,

21
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,281
sixty?
The length of the bow.

22
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:18,414
Is there a difference,
do you sometimes see a very

23
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,715
long bow, sometimes a very short
one?

24
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:23,848
What is the width of the bow?
You see colors here.

25
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:26,597
How wide is that strip of
colors in degrees?

26
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:29,601
Perhaps some of you have
noticed that there is a

27
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:33,117
difference in light intensity
between inside the bow and

28
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:37,337
outside the bow.
Maybe you've never seen it,

29
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:40,366
and if there is a difference
where is it brighter,

30
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,406
inside the bow or outside the
bow?

31
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,817
What time of the day would you
see bows?

32
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:48,279
Would you see rainbows in the
north, east, south or west?

33
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:50,752
Is there perhaps a second bow
in the sky?

34
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:54,338
And if there is a second one,
where should you look for the

35
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:56,749
second bow?
And if there is a second one

36
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,469
what is the color sequence of
the second bow?

37
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,746
Is the red on the outside or is
the red on the inside?

38
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:06,208
And then you can ask the same
question, what would be the

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,074
radius
of the second bow?

40
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:12,065
And what would be the width of
the second bow?

41
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,256
All these first twelve
questions in principle you

42
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:18,979
should have been able to answer
if you really have seen a

43
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,973
rainbow.
The last three is more

44
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,499
difficult.
The question is are the bows

45
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:25,892
polarized?
In what direction are they

46
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,484
polarized?
And are they weakly polarized

47
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:32,539
or are they strongly polarized?
Who knows the answer to twelve

48
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,198
questions, to the first twelve
questions?

49
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:38,722
Who knows the answer to more
than

50
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:42,569
ten?
Who knows the answer to nine?

51
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,967
Eight?
Seven?

52
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,017
Six?
Five?

53
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:48,397
Four?
Do I see a hand at four?

54
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:52,011
Good for you.
Five, four, three?

55
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:55,742
Three, good,
that's already good.

56
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,674
Two?
One?

57
00:02:56,674 --> 00:03:00,405
And who knows the answer to
zero?

58
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,503
Most of you,
right?

59
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:09,032
I haven't seen a lot of hands
though.

60
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:11,59
All right.
So I've made my point.

61
00:03:11,59 --> 00:03:16,307
You've looked at rainbows but
you've really never seen them.

62
00:03:16,307 --> 00:03:19,505
And I'm going to make you see
them today.

63
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:23,983
What you see here on the
blackboard is one drop of water.

64
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:27,421
I put the sun for simplicity at
the horizon.

65
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:31,418
Later I will put it a little
bit higher in the sky.

66
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:34,377
Light from the sun hits this
raindrop.

67
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:39,174
I've only drawn one narrow beam
which hits the raindrop right

68
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:43,412
there.
And you see here the angle of

69
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:47,16
incidence, which with Snell's
law we call theta one.

70
00:03:47,16 --> 00:03:50,247
I call it I here because it's
nicer for me,

71
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:53,335
more descriptive,
it means incidence angle.

72
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:57,745
Right at that point A some of
the light will be reflected and

73
00:03:57,745 --> 00:04:00,685
some of the light will go into
the water.

74
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:04,508
We call that refraction.
And Snell's law will tell me

75
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:07,668
this angle R.
Whatever goes in there reaches

76
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:11,564
point B where there is a
transition back to air and so

77
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:17,591
some of that light will come out
here and some of that light will

78
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,161
be reflected inside.
And then when it reaches point

79
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,517
C again there is a transition
from water to air.

80
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:28,301
Some of that light will be
reflected inside the water.

81
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,443
And some of it will come out.
And as far as the geometry is

82
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:36,441
concerned, if this angle is R,
then this angle is also R,

83
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:38,868
this is also R,
and this is also R.

84
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:42,724
And the angle here is I.
That follows from Snell's law,

85
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:46,865
and I'll leave you with that.
Notice that the light came in

86
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:51,269
like
this but it comes back like

87
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,819
this.
So the direction has changed

88
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:59,983
over the angle delta.
And the angle delta is very

89
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:03,963
easy to calculate in terms of I
and R.

90
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:10,095
Delta is a hundred eighty
degrees plus two I minus four R.

91
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:13,537
I want you to check that at
home.

92
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:17,948
The four Rs come in here.
One, two, three,

93
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:23,541
four, and the two I's come in
here and

94
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,245
there.
If now I think of all possible

95
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:30,074
narrow beams of light that can
strike this raindrop,

96
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:34,654
one that would strike it here
would have an I of zero degrees.

97
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:38,859
And then here would be ten
degrees and twenty degrees and

98
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:42,388
thirty and forty.
And the largest value for I is

99
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:46,292
when the light strikes here,
would be ninety degrees.

100
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:49,896
And so I can calculate for all
these values of I,

101
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:55,339
which obviously all of them
occur, sunlight strikes this

102
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,264
raindrop, and all these angles
for I are present.

103
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:04,333
So I can calculate now for all
these angles of I what the value

104
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,176
is for R and then I can
calculate what delta is.

105
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:12,51
R follows from Snell's law and
delta follows from this

106
00:06:12,51 --> 00:06:16,925
geometric relationship.
And what you will find now very

107
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:21,095
much to your surprise,
that there is a minimum value

108
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:26,983
for delta which is about hundred
and thirty-eight degrees.

109
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:31,971
That means this angle phi here
has a maximum value which is

110
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:35,068
very roughly about forty-two
degrees.

111
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:37,82
And I will show you some
numbers.

112
00:06:37,82 --> 00:06:42,378
You can download this,
by the way, this is on the Web,

113
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:47,281
under lecture supplements.
Here all I have done I've taken

114
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:52,098
I to be from zero to ninety
degrees, all these angles are

115
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:57,086
possible, with Snell's law,
using an index of refraction of

116
00:06:57,086 --> 00:07:00,641
one point
three three six,

117
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:05,858
that you see at the bottom,
I calculate R and then in the

118
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:10,796
last column using that
relationship I calculate delta.

119
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:15,92
And indeed you see that delta
starts at a hundred eighty

120
00:07:15,92 --> 00:07:20,764
degrees when I is zero.
And then goes to a minimum of

121
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:26,54
roughly a hundred thirty-eight,
after which it increases again.

122
00:07:26,54 --> 00:07:30,826
And this now is crucial,
is key to

123
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,655
an understanding of the
rainbow.

124
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,338
Imagine now that I have one
drop of water here.

125
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:47,38
And sunlight comes in at all
angles of I, not just at one,

126
00:07:47,38 --> 00:07:53,311
but all angles of I.
Whatever you see here has of

127
00:07:53,311 --> 00:08:00,105
course axial symmetry.
It is a spherical drop.

128
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,75
And the light comes in like
this.

129
00:08:02,75 --> 00:08:07,047
So light can go this way but it
can also go this way.

130
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:12,005
And it can also go this way and
this way, so there's complete

131
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:15,641
axial symmetry,
so this whole drawing you can

132
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:20,268
rotate about this line here.
And everything holds then in

133
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:23,821
axial symmetry.
So therefore if phi maximum,

134
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:27,622
if this angle phi maximum is
forty-two degrees,

135
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:32,167
then the light that will go
back in the direction of the

136
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:36,394
sun,
the light that goes through the

137
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:40,251
journey A B C and then comes out
of the raindrop,

138
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:45,072
that's all I'm talking about,
now, I'm not talking about this

139
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:48,769
light that sneaks out here,
it is this journey,

140
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,582
A, refraction at A,
reflection at B,

141
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:55,76
and then coming out at C.
That light comes out in the

142
00:08:55,76 --> 00:08:59,216
form of a cone.
And the half -- top angle of

143
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:02,591
the cone must be roughly
forty-two degrees.

144
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:08,661
And so I will go --
I'm going to draw that cone for

145
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:09,921
you.
Like so.

146
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:14,229
And like so.
And you have to think of this

147
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:18,011
as a cone.
It's completely symmetric,

148
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:21,374
axial symmetric,
about this line.

149
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:26,942
And this angle here then is
roughly forty-two degrees.

150
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:32,09
No light can go here.
Because that would mean that

151
00:09:32,09 --> 00:09:37,134
phi would be larger than
forty-two

152
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:42,017
degrees and that's not allowed.
Now comes something very

153
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:45,569
important.
The index of refraction of red

154
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:50,009
light for water is about one
point three three one.

155
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,981
And that translates into an
angle for phi max which I can

156
00:09:54,981 --> 00:10:00,309
calculate now -- it translates
into an angle of phi max which

157
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,594
is about forty-two point four
degrees.

158
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:09,01
But blue light has a slightly
different index of

159
00:10:09,01 --> 00:10:13,919
refraction, therefore has a
slightly different angle for phi

160
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,076
max, and the blue light has an
index of refraction of something

161
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:24,234
like one point three four three.
Notice I have blue light and I

162
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:28,477
don't use violet light.
Violet is much harder to see

163
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:32,221
with our eyes.
So I always refer to it as blue

164
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,049
light.
And that has a value for phi

165
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:40,539
max which is approximately forty
point seven degrees.

166
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,722
A different index of refraction
means of course that if you know

167
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:47,975
I that R is slightly different,
using Snell's law,

168
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:50,763
so you get slightly different
values for R,

169
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:54,083
and so you get slightly
different values for delta,

170
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,734
so you get a slightly different
value for delta minimum,

171
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:00,788
you get a slightly different
value for phi max.

172
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:04,373
What does this mean now?
That means if you look at this

173
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:08,223
cone of light that goes back
into the direction of the sun,

174
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:11,344
that the outer edge,
the outer

175
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:14,936
surface of that cone,
which has the largest possible

176
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:18,669
angle, this angle is now
forty-two point four degrees,

177
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:22,051
must be red light,
because blue light cannot come

178
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,643
out in that direction.
Because the maximum angle for

179
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,447
blue is forty point seven,
is not forty-two point four.

180
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:33,744
So it's only red light that can
come out when the angle -- the

181
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:37,548
half angle of the cone is
forty-two point four degrees.

182
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:42,337
And the blue light is not going
to make it until this

183
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:47,144
angle here -- I'll put it in
here -- is forty point seven

184
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:50,148
degrees.
If you look inside the cone

185
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:55,384
with an half top angle of forty
point seven degrees all colors

186
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:59,16
can come back.
All this is saying is that for

187
00:11:59,16 --> 00:12:03,023
red light phi maximum is
forty-two point four.

188
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:06,628
It can also therefore be forty
point seven.

189
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:09,546
It can be thirty.
It can be twenty.

190
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,035
It can be ten.
It can be zero.

191
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:17,009
Light that comes
in here at I equals zero

192
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,22
reaches point P,
comes straight back.

193
00:12:20,22 --> 00:12:23,61
That's allowed.
Phi would be zero then.

194
00:12:23,61 --> 00:12:28,695
If all the colors can make it
back inside this cone that I

195
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:33,512
have given here a blue color,
that would mean that your

196
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:37,348
brains will tell you that it is
white light.

197
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:41,362
Because you see red light,
you see blue light,

198
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:45,927
you see green light,
you see yellow light,

199
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:50,086
and so your brains will tell
you that that is white light.

200
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:53,952
If I had a screen here with a
small opening to let the

201
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:58,329
sunlight in and I asked you what
would you see on this screen

202
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:01,903
having only one water drop,
then you would see the

203
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:05,624
intersection of this cone of
light with this screen.

204
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:08,834
And it would look as follows.
The outer edge,

205
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:12,116
the outer circle,
which is the intersection of

206
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:16,201
the cone with your screen,
would be red.

207
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:21,121
And then there would be an
inner portion whereby all colors

208
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:24,768
can come back.
So that would be white light.

209
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:28,33
And then as you go further in
from the red,

210
00:13:28,33 --> 00:13:32,911
until you reach that white
portion, then the last color

211
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:38
that will be added is the blue.
And you can already of course

212
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42,665
sense that all the action about
the rainbow occurs here.

213
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:46,481
And here there is no light.
It's

214
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:51,066
going to be dark because there
is no way that phi can be larger

215
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:53,506
than forty-two point four
degrees.

216
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:57,721
And if light would appear on
the screen outside the red it

217
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:01,787
means that phi would be larger
than forty-two point four

218
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:05,41
degrees and that's not allowed.
So it's dark here.

219
00:14:05,41 --> 00:14:08,516
It's white light here.
It's red light here.

220
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:12,583
Then as you go further in you
will finally see the other

221
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,319
colors.
And this really is now the key

222
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:19,359
to
the geometry of the -- of the

223
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,449
rainbow.
I'm going to put you here,

224
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:27,266
so here you're standing,
and let the sun again be near

225
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,083
the horizon.
It's always nice when you make

226
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,446
a picture.
The easy reference that you

227
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:36,809
have.
You're standing here.

228
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,354
Sunlight is coming in in this
direction.

229
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:45,08
And there is rain here.
If it's also raining here you

230
00:14:45,08 --> 00:14:48,128
won't
see a rainbow.

231
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:52,603
Because the sun will not be
able to hit these raindrops.

232
00:14:52,603 --> 00:14:57,16
So it's essential that it's
raining in the direction away

233
00:14:57,16 --> 00:15:00,985
from the sun but that you can
still see the sun.

234
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:04,077
So here are these raindrops.
All right.

235
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:07,576
You're looking in this
direction in the sky.

236
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:10,505
You're looking up in the sky
like so.

237
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:14,818
And I pick here one raindrop
and only one but what I'm

238
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:20,84
telling you holds for all the
raindrops in that direction.

239
00:15:20,84 --> 00:15:26,351
What will that raindrop do?
That raindrop will produce a

240
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:32,765
cone of light which goes back in
the direction of the sun whereby

241
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:37,775
the edge of the cone is red
light and this angle is

242
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:41,684
forty-two degrees,
forty-two point four,

243
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:44,189
whatever.
What do you see?

244
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:47,997
Nothing.
Because there is no light that

245
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:52,185
can come from
this raindrop in your

246
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,2
direction.
There is no light because that

247
00:15:55,2 --> 00:15:59,346
would mean that phi is larger
than forty-two degrees and

248
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:03,115
that's not allowed.
So you look high up in the sky,

249
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:07,411
you will not see any light
coming back from that raindrop.

250
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:10,954
And think of the whole thing as
axial symmetric,

251
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,537
right?
Not only there,

252
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:16,004
but there and there you will
not see any light.

253
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:19,999
Now I am looking say at some
raindrops which are here.

254
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:24,603
I pick one.
It holds for any one in that

255
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:27,798
direction.
And so now I draw a line to

256
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:30,907
this point.
This is what I'm looking.

257
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,879
I look in this direction.
I take this raindrop.

258
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,729
I could have picked this
raindrop.

259
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:42,824
I could have picked this one.
Would have made no difference.

260
00:16:42,824 --> 00:16:47,919
What is that raindrop doing?
Well, that raindrop is throwing

261
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,014
back at the sun light in the
form of a cone and the cone has

262
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:58,151
this angle forty-two degrees,
forty-two degrees.

263
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,887
What do you see now?
Look.

264
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:02,526
You're looking straight into
that cone.

265
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:06,137
You're nowhere near the edge.
So you see white light.

266
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:10,373
Because green light comes back
at you, red light comes back at

267
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,665
you, everything comes back at
you.

268
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,235
So you will say ha,
I see white light.

269
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,596
Not only there,
low on the horizon,

270
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:21,763
but the whole thing is axial
symmetric, also there and there.

271
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:24,055
So you haven't seen a rainbow
yet.

272
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:27,736
But now suppose I ask you to
look

273
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:32,681
up in the sky at a very
specific angle and we'll make

274
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:36,294
the angle forty-two point four
degrees.

275
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:42
So you're looking at the sky in
the direction somewhere here,

276
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46,85
I'm not quite sure that I have
the angle just right.

277
00:17:46,85 --> 00:17:51,51
So I'm looking in the sky here.
Pick one raindrop.

278
00:17:51,51 --> 00:17:55,979
But you could pick any one,
any other other one.

279
00:17:55,979 --> 00:18:00,924
There's nothing special about
that one.

280
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:03,757
So the sunlight comes in like
so.

281
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:08,803
What is that raindrop doing?
Well, it's throwing a cone of

282
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:13,494
light back to the sun.
And it just so happens that you

283
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:18,717
are only looking at the outer
surface of the cone where only

284
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:24,117
red light can go because this is
the famous angle of forty-two

285
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:28,011
point four degrees.
And so you see red light.

286
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:33,323
And since the whole problem is
axial symmetric,

287
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:37,651
you would see red light if you
look forty-two point four

288
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:42,295
degrees in this direction but
also forty-two degrees in this

289
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:45,916
direction, away from this
direction to the sun.

290
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,717
And so now you see how the bow
is being formed by zillions and

291
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:55,439
zillions of small water drops
which each of them in their own

292
00:18:55,439 --> 00:19:00,004
way contribute to your rainbow.
And we'll now put the sun a

293
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:03,94
little higher in the sky.
So I'll put you here now.

294
00:19:03,94 --> 00:19:07,718
And let's say the sun is now
like

295
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:10,262
so.
So, you look at your shadow

296
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:13,315
here on the ground.
The sun is there.

297
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:16,623
There's your shadow.
Here's your shadow.

298
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,253
Here's your head -- your
shadow.

299
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:23,918
And this is the reference line
that we're talking about.

300
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:27,056
That is this line.
That was this line.

301
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:30,109
And so where would you see a
rainbow?

302
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:35,029
You have to look now forty-two
degrees away from that line.

303
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:39,693
Forty-two degrees away from
that line.

304
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:43,881
That would be red then and a
little lower would be your your

305
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,436
blue.
And so if I sketch in there the

306
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:50,694
bow, it would be sort of like
this and then the blue would be

307
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:55,165
on the inside and here you would
have white light and this would

308
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:58,288
then be the red.
It's always relative to this

309
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:01,553
reference line.
This would be roughly -- I call

310
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:04,391
it forty-two degrees,
but according to my

311
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:08,224
calculation, there it would be
be forty-two point four.

312
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:12,791
So whenever you know where
the sun is, you look at the

313
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,272
shadow of your own head and you
have to go forty-two point four

314
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:19,64
degrees away from that direction
from your eye to the shadow.

315
00:20:19,64 --> 00:20:23,064
And so what you're seeing now
is that if the sun is low in the

316
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:26,376
horizon then the bow will be
high above the horizon and when

317
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:29,856
the sun is rising then the bow
goes down and goes down and goes

318
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:33,168
down and by the time that the
sun is forty-two degrees above

319
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:36,761
the horizon, you're not going to
see a rainbow anymore unless the

320
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:41,028
water is right where you are.
If the water is at a distance,

321
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:45,239
you won't see a rainbow.
So the higher the sun in the

322
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:50,018
sky, the less likely it is that
you will ever see a rainbow.

323
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:55,04
Before I show you some -- some
slides and before we're going to

324
00:20:55,04 --> 00:20:59,656
answer some of the questions,
uh, I want to mention to you

325
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:03,544
that what I went through here is
refraction at A,

326
00:21:03,544 --> 00:21:07,918
reflection at B -- reflection
at B and coming out at C.

327
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:13,75
You can go through the same
geometry and allow for one more

328
00:21:13,75 --> 00:21:17,785
reflection at C and then let
the light come out,

329
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:22,164
so it would come out at point D
and if you did that,

330
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:27,487
you can convince yourself that
there is indeed a second rainbow

331
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:32,296
and we call that the secondary.
We call this the primary.

332
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:37,19
And the secondary has a radius
-- this one of course has a

333
00:21:37,19 --> 00:21:42,513
radius of forty-two point four
degrees for the red and the blue

334
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:45,737
would have a
smaller radius.

335
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:49,833
The secondary has a radius for
the red of fifty point four

336
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,414
degrees.
So in the red,

337
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:54,719
it's fifty point four degrees,
and in the blue,

338
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:57,162
it's larger.
So the blue is outside

339
00:21:57,162 --> 00:22:00,61
fifty-two point five degrees.
Is that what it is?

340
00:22:00,61 --> 00:22:04,275
Fifty-three point five.
The secondary bow is fainter

341
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:08,801
and it is also wider because you
see this separation in terms of

342
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,747
angle is larger than the
separation there.

343
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,556
That's only one point seven
degrees

344
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:18,217
and this is,
uh, more than three degrees.

345
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:22,209
And so there is a secondary bow
and the secondary bow is only

346
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:25,07
about roughly ten degrees above
the primary.

347
00:22:25,07 --> 00:22:28,862
So if you see your primary at
forty-two degree angles away

348
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:32,655
from your shadow there and there
and there, go another ten

349
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:35,249
degrees and you should see a
second bow.

350
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,778
And you should see the colors
reversed.

351
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:41,304
Red is there on the outside and
blue is on the inside.

352
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:45,628
Red is on the outside and blue
is on the inside.

353
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:48,788
Red is on the outside and blue
is on the inside,

354
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:51,611
but here it is reversed.
The secondary bow,

355
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:55,308
the red is on the inside and
the blue is on the outside.

356
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,593
So let's answer some questions
now.

357
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:01,76
We'll put the questions back up
again and you will see that you

358
00:23:01,76 --> 00:23:05,928
can now without any difficulty
already answer twelve questions.

359
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,079
The first twelve.
Red is outside.

360
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,028
That is non-negotiable,
right?

361
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:13,523
That follows immediately from
what we'd talked about,

362
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,607
but that's not an issue
anymore.

363
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:20,696
The radius is about forty-two
degrees and the length of the

364
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:24,451
bow, well that depends on if the
sun is high in the sky then the

365
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:27,729
length will be very small
because this whole s- arc will

366
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:30,888
then go down and there will only
be a little bit left.

367
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:34,225
It could also be that it's only
raining here and it's not

368
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:36,788
raining there.
So depending upon where there

369
00:23:36,788 --> 00:23:40,483
is rain and how high the sun is
in the sky, that will determine

370
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:43,046
the length of the bow.
The width of the bow,

371
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,953
you would think,
perhaps naively,

372
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:48,053
that if you subtract the
forty-two

373
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:51,298
from the forty -- forty point
seven from the forty two point

374
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:54,654
four that that would give you
the width of the bow which would

375
00:23:54,654 --> 00:23:56,855
then be one point seven degrees
in angle.

376
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:59,771
However, you would overlook
then that the sun is not a

377
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,017
point, but that the sun in the
sky has a dimension of half a

378
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:05,382
degree and each point of the
sun, of course,

379
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:08,353
makes its own little rainbow,
so you really have to add

380
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:11,049
roughly half a degree.
So, the width of the bow is

381
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,13
more like, something like two
degrees rather than the one

382
00:24:14,13 --> 00:24:16,715
point seven, maybe two -- two
point two degrees.

383
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:20,402
It's a little wider than what
you would think.

384
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:22,929
It has to do with the finite
size of the sun.

385
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,456
A comparison of the light
inside and outside,

386
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:28,385
clearly inside the bow,
there must be a lot of white

387
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,085
light which you don't see
outside the bow -- big

388
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:33,382
difference.
You will see a slide shortly.

389
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:36,943
The time of the day -- well the
sun has to be a little bit low,

390
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:39,93
so you don't expect it at
midday and you want rain as

391
00:24:39,93 --> 00:24:42,917
well, so late afternoon,
early morning would be ideal

392
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,846
and you can figure out uh in
what direction to look.

393
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:48,603
If it's early morning,
the sun rises in the east,

394
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:52,452
you would see the bows in the
west and late in

395
00:24:52,452 --> 00:24:56,81
the afternoon when the sun is
in the west, you would see the

396
00:24:56,81 --> 00:24:59,987
bows in the east.
Yes there is a second bow.

397
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:04,272
It is about ten degrees higher
in the sky than the primary.

398
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:08,631
And the colors are reversed.
The blue is outside and the red

399
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:11,069
is inside.
And the radius is about

400
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:14,393
fifty-two degrees.
And the width of the bow is

401
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:18,826
again the difference between
these two numbers which you have

402
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:23,111
to add about half a degree.
So you would think on the basis

403
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:27,322
of this that it is more like
three degrees and you have to

404
00:25:27,322 --> 00:25:32,642
add roughly the half a degree,
so it's about three --

405
00:25:32,642 --> 00:25:37,884
three-and-a-half degrees.
So let's now look at some

406
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:41,553
slides.
And the first slide that you

407
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:45,851
will see is a -- is a drawing
that I made.

408
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:51,198
Which uh is meant to repeat
some of what I told you.

409
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:56,86
So you see a person standing
there and here you see the

410
00:25:56,86 --> 00:26:02,941
direction to the sun.
Your shadow would be this

411
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:04,984
long.
This would be your head of the

412
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:08,488
shadow, here would be your feet.
And if there are water drops

413
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:11,175
here and if there's no
interference between the

414
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:14,678
sunlight and the water drops
then in this direction forty-two

415
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:17,073
degrees you would see this water
drop red.

416
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:20,518
And then the water drops which
were here you would see white

417
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:24,08
light from those water drops and
maybe from this one you would

418
00:26:24,08 --> 00:26:27,292
see red as well as blue.
And if you have water near your

419
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:30,621
feet there's no reason why you
can't see the rainbow there

420
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:34,534
either but of course you would
have to lead some

421
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:36,798
garden hose to produce water
there.

422
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,062
The next slide then.
This is a drawing made by the

423
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:42,993
maestro himself,
Newton, who was the first to

424
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:45,924
fully understand the workings of
the rainbow.

425
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:49,654
You see here the primary bow
and for those of you who are

426
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:53,65
sitting close you can see the
direction of the sunlight going

427
00:26:53,65 --> 00:26:56,248
in at A, reflects at B,
coming out at C.

428
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,713
Which he calls E,
but that's a detail.

429
00:26:58,713 --> 00:27:02,176
And here you see then the
secondary whereby the light

430
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:06,24
comes in, one reflection,
two reflections,

431
00:27:06,24 --> 00:27:09,178
and now it comes back at you
and that gives you the

432
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:11,529
secondary.
And so this is red and this is

433
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,232
blue whereas here this is blue
and this is red.

434
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,76
The next slide.
So if the sun is high in the

435
00:27:16,76 --> 00:27:19,992
sky, I've done this many times
when I was uh watering my

436
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:23,283
garden, you get this for free,
you might as well do this,

437
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:25,458
it's great fun,
you're standing there,

438
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:29,102
gives you an immense feeling of
power, and is completely clear,

439
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:32,334
there's not a -- not a cloud in
the sky, there's no rain

440
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:35,449
anywhere, but you spray water
around you and you see a

441
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:39,003
beautiful rainbow
encircling your feet.

442
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:42,903
And always what matters is this
forty-two degree angle relative

443
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:46,929
to the direction from the sun to
you and this is where the shadow

444
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:49,885
of my head would be.
Very easy to do and I would

445
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,967
recommend that you try that when
you get a chance.

446
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:56,238
The next slide is a painting
from the eighth century,

447
00:27:56,238 --> 00:27:59,949
Turkey, I see a hand here --
probably makes reference to the

448
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:03,849
Bible, but I think it reads in
the Bible I do set my bow in the

449
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,748
clouds, it's very nice and very
dandy, the fact that the colors

450
00:28:07,748 --> 00:28:11,242
are wrong,
the sequence of the colors,

451
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:13,552
that's a detail,
it's a nice picture,

452
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:16,953
but red has to be on the
outside and blue has to be on

453
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:18,492
the inside.
Small detail.

454
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:19,712
Next slide.
Ah yeah.

455
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:22,984
A -- a few years ago,
actually it's more than a few,

456
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:26,385
when I was first lecturing
eight oh three I knew I was

457
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:30,042
going to talk about the rainbow,
ideal for eight oh three.

458
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,763
And so I wanted to make some
rainbows myself in my backyard

459
00:28:33,763 --> 00:28:36,458
in Winchester.
And so there is water coming

460
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:40,821
out of a um water hose and the
sun was behind me

461
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:44,148
and I took this picture and you
see indeed all the ingredients

462
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:46,711
that we just discussed.
Notice the red is on the

463
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:48,728
outside and the blue is on the
inside.

464
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:51,891
You see all this white light.
That is that light that comes

465
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:55,217
back from the water drop but if
you go here where the angle of

466
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:57,507
phi would be larger than
forty-two degrees,

467
00:28:57,507 --> 00:29:00,288
which is not allowed,
you don't see any light coming

468
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,124
back at you, so you look
straight through and see the

469
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:06,45
forest without any white light.
So you really see already here

470
00:29:06,45 --> 00:29:10,104
sky so to speak is bright here
and darker there.

471
00:29:10,104 --> 00:29:13,596
I needed help from my daughter.
And the next slide will show

472
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:15,905
you that.
The poor darling was suffering

473
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:17,148
badly.
It was January,

474
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:19,279
it was freezing cold,
she was crying.

475
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,535
She was really crying and I
felt guilty but I said look,

476
00:29:22,535 --> 00:29:25,851
you know I really need these
slides for my eight oh three

477
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,515
class, it'll only take you
half-an-hour or so,

478
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:31,83
and she still remembers it,
I had email exchange with her

479
00:29:31,83 --> 00:29:35,441
yesterday and she said dad I was
crying, it was an awful thing

480
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,691
what you did to me.
But look, but look.

481
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:40,591
You know, you got to do
something, and when you're

482
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:44,421
daughter of a
scientist occasionally you have

483
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:47,271
to suffer a little bit.
And so she's holding here the

484
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:50,559
-- the water hose and you see
the same thing red outside blue

485
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,628
inside, and clearly the white
light, you see this is that

486
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:56,094
white light that I discussed
with you earlier.

487
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,218
The next slide will show you
then a real rainbow -- oh no,

488
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:02,397
this is the um this is the
artificial one I made uh over my

489
00:30:02,397 --> 00:30:05,849
driveway, if you want to see the
secondary, you need a real dark

490
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:08,48
background, because the
secondary is quite faint.

491
00:30:08,48 --> 00:30:12,973
And so that's why I did it over
my driveway and you see here the

492
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:16,056
primary, red on the outside,
blue on the inside,

493
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:18,417
and here you see the colors
reversed.

494
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:21,631
You can also see perhaps that
it's a little wider.

495
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,32
But it's always much s- it's
much fainter,

496
00:30:24,32 --> 00:30:28,19
so it's -- it's hard to tell.
And then the next slide is one

497
00:30:28,19 --> 00:30:32,06
that's a wonderful slide made by
Doug Johnson in New Mexico,

498
00:30:32,06 --> 00:30:35,011
Socorro, it is where the radio
telescopes are,

499
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:38,291
the very large array,
now look, red on the outside,

500
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:41,439
blue on the inside.
The sky you got to admit is a

501
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,885
hell
of a lot brighter here than it

502
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,404
is there.
And you may never have noticed

503
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:51,474
that, you've -- you've looked at
it but you've never seen it and

504
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:55,349
then here you see the secondary
red on the inside blue on the

505
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:57,739
outside.
There is a phenomenon that we

506
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:01,615
have never discussed uh in eight
oh two yet, it's coming up I

507
00:31:01,615 --> 00:31:04,392
think next week.
And that phenomenon we call

508
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:06,976
diffraction.
Snell's law cannot deal with

509
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,56
diffraction.
That occurs when water drops

510
00:31:09,56 --> 00:31:14,017
are very very small,
say, smaller than a tenth of a

511
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:16,462
millimeter.
What you then get over and

512
00:31:16,462 --> 00:31:20,361
above the bow you get areas in
the bow whereby you get as we

513
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,609
call that destructive
interference,

514
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:26,574
the waves begin to kill each
other and you get dark bands and

515
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:29,945
you can actually see that here.
With a little bit of

516
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:32,324
imagination you see here a dark
band.

517
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:36,29
And when that is the case the
water is always extremely small

518
00:31:36,29 --> 00:31:40,123
in size and we give this a name,
we call this supernumerary

519
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:41,841
bows.
It's not so uncommon.

520
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:46,043
If the water drops become
exceedingly small,

521
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:49,062
let's say, smaller even than
fifty microns,

522
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:52,799
then this diffraction
phenomenon becomes so important

523
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,537
that in addition to the dark
bands all the colors are

524
00:31:56,537 --> 00:32:00,921
beginning to wash out over each
other, and that creates then a

525
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:03,365
white rainbow.
Plus the dark bands.

526
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:07,461
And a student of mine who was
in my eight oh three lecture

527
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:11,558
sent me years later the next
slide when he was -- his name

528
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,367
was Carl Wales,
this picture he took,

529
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,645
it's three hundred forty miles
from the North Pole,

530
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,579
he was at Fletcher Island at
the time, this picture was taken

531
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:26,512
at two AM at night in July when
the sun is above the horizon.

532
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:30,445
And so this must be the result
of very fine water drops which

533
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:32,74
somehow are there in the
atmosphere.

534
00:32:32,74 --> 00:32:36,673
Doesn't look like it's raining
but there must have been small

535
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:38,902
water drops.
Fifty microns or less.

536
00:32:38,902 --> 00:32:42,115
And here you see the
white-colored rainbow and you

537
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:46,114
also see beautifully the
supernumerary bows,

538
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:50,669
you see the -- the dark bands
in there and the next slide is a

539
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,806
close-up of that.
So you see here the white

540
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:57,84
rainbow plus the dark bands
which is the phenomenon the

541
00:32:57,84 --> 00:33:02,097
result of uh of diffraction.
Now before I will discuss the

542
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:06,279
polarization of the bows,
because I still owe you answers

543
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:09,79
to the last three questions,
now that I'm at it,

544
00:33:09,79 --> 00:33:13,449
I want to show you some
phenomenon which are quite

545
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:17,259
common which you may never have
seen

546
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:20,453
even though they're quite
common and they're rather

547
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:23,136
spectacular.
The first slide that comes now

548
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:26,266
shows you what we call the
twenty-two degree halo.

549
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:30,035
It's very common around the
sun, it's very common around the

550
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:31,504
moon.
The red is inside.

551
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:33,485
It has nothing to do with
water.

552
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:36,36
It is the result of ice
crystals way up in the

553
00:33:36,36 --> 00:33:38,723
atmosphere.
You can see it both in the

554
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:42,556
summer as well as in the winter
because it's very cold way up

555
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:45,431
there also in the summer.
This is very common.

556
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:48,944
The reason why you and I don't
see

557
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,595
it that often,
because who wants to look in

558
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:55,003
the direction of the sun.
This angle is only twenty-two

559
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:58,348
degrees, it's not so far.
But I would advise you to at

560
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:02,135
least keep an eye on the moon.
Because the moon also has this

561
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:05,48
twenty-two degree halo.
And of course it's much easier

562
00:34:05,48 --> 00:34:07,752
to look in the direction of the
moon.

563
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:10,781
That doesn't uh -- any no
problems for your eyes.

564
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:14,379
This is very common that I see
this at least three or four

565
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:18,166
times per month and I always
look for it of

566
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,342
course.
The next um slide shows you

567
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:24,311
both the twenty-two degree halo
as well as the forty-six degree

568
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:27,192
halo which is way more -- way
way less common,

569
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:30,84
it's very rare to see the
forty-six degree -- I've seen it

570
00:34:30,84 --> 00:34:32,889
only a few times.
It's very rare.

571
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,602
In addition to the twenty-two
degree halo and the forty-six

572
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:39,61
degree halo you sometimes see
bright spots here.

573
00:34:39,61 --> 00:34:42,107
You see them here and you see
them here.

574
00:34:42,107 --> 00:34:44,732
They're really not circles.
They are arcs.

575
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:49,021
And they have names,
they call them uh sun dogs,

576
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,696
mock suns, they have various
names.

577
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:55,945
I've seen this often in in
Boston, the forty-six degree

578
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:59,171
halo is rare.
All of this as the result by

579
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:03,342
the way of um ice crystals.
Ice crystals way up in the

580
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:07,04
earth atmosphere.
And there is a phenomenon that

581
00:35:07,04 --> 00:35:10,345
many of you may have seen from
an airplane.

582
00:35:10,345 --> 00:35:14,752
Uh if your airplane flies over
clouds and you look at the

583
00:35:14,752 --> 00:35:19,316
shadow of your airplane onto the
cloud you may have noticed

584
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:23,375
colorful rings
around the shadow of your

585
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,837
airplane.
And the next slide is such an

586
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:28,104
example.
I took this picture several

587
00:35:28,104 --> 00:35:30,501
years ago.
You are always right at the

588
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:33,481
center of the circle.
So you can see that I was

589
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:36,785
sitting just behind the wings.
This is the result of

590
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:39,506
diffraction.
Got nothing to do with Snell's

591
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,773
law.
It is the result though of very

592
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:45,595
very fine water drops but not in
the sense of refraction and

593
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:49,223
reflection the way that we
discussed it with the rainbow.

594
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:52,722
This is the result of
diffraction.

595
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:56,146
It's extremely difficult,
the explanation of the glory.

596
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:59,253
And even ten years ago,
I read an enormous article

597
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:02,233
about it, I think it was in
Scientific American.

598
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:06,037
Which made an utter attempt to
be very quantitative about the

599
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:09,462
explanation, which is not easy.
The radius of this bow,

600
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:12,949
if you want to call it a bow,
depends on the size of the

601
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:15,422
water drops.
If the water drops are very

602
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:17,958
small the radius is
substantially larger.

603
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:22,777
So as you fly over clouds you
may fly over different clouds

604
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:27,093
with different size of water
drops and on a very short time

605
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:30,812
scale will you see the radius of
this glory change.

606
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:34,755
It can be very rapidly.
It could be on a time scale of

607
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:37,583
seconds to minutes.
It's very dramatic.

608
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:40,782
It's very clear.
And these rings can extend,

609
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:45,022
there's just not one ring,
but you can have several rings.

610
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:48,965
And so this is the result of
what we call diffraction.

611
00:36:48,965 --> 00:36:54,667
Now I want to mention to you
another phenomenon which is um

612
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:59,838
also the result of diffraction.
And that you can see when there

613
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,008
is fog.
If you have fog fog consists of

614
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:07,762
extremely small water drops,
just like the ones in clouds.

615
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:10,765
I mean fog is a cloud,
let's face it.

616
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:15,352
Then if you for instance had
the headlights of a car you

617
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:20,44
could see your own shadow onto
the fog away from the direction

618
00:37:20,44 --> 00:37:23,693
of the car.
And that means you could see

619
00:37:23,693 --> 00:37:27,591
then
around your head the same kind

620
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:30,191
of stuff that you saw here.
A glory.

621
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:33,238
We call this a fogbow.
That's just a name.

622
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:36,507
The Germans have a much better
name for that,

623
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:40,742
they call it Heiligenschein.
And heilige person is someone

624
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:44,532
who is a saint and so you see
this around your head,

625
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:48,841
so it is sort of the -- the
radiation that you would expect

626
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,813
from a saint.
Quite a few years ago I was

627
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:55,529
invited to visit the Soviet
Union.

628
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:58,65
And they took me to the
Caucasus, to show me the

629
00:37:58,65 --> 00:38:02,767
six-meter telescope which was at
the time the largest telescope

630
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:05,091
on earth.
And I went there for a few

631
00:38:05,091 --> 00:38:07,017
days.
And I noticed much to my

632
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:10,935
surprise that every night at
five o'clock there would be fog

633
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,587
coming out of the valley
overtaking the telescope so you

634
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:18,571
could make no observations at
night but that was a detail and

635
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:21,56
what I realized is that the fog
was coming up,

636
00:38:21,56 --> 00:38:23,95
the sun was there,
that was the west,

637
00:38:23,95 --> 00:38:29,104
and the valley was at the east,
and so I said to myself my

638
00:38:29,104 --> 00:38:33,266
goodness if only at the right
moment of time I am there then

639
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:37,639
the sun is my light beam and my
shadow will fall onto this wall

640
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:41,307
of fog coming towards me,
this is my chance to make a

641
00:38:41,307 --> 00:38:44,129
wonderful picture of this
Heiligenschein.

642
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:46,527
And I'll show you that I
succeeded.

643
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:50,689
I will first show you a picture
of this bizarre observatory.

644
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:54,004
This is the six-meter telescope
in the Caucasus.

645
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:58,095
And this is indeed you could
every night around five-thirty

646
00:38:58,095 --> 00:39:02,192
really like a wall
the fog will just coming

647
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:05,633
towards you overtake you.
You can see the timing of my

648
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:09,398
picture was extremely crucial.
If you wait a little bit too

649
00:39:09,398 --> 00:39:13,488
long then the fog overtakes you
and then the sun would obviously

650
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:17,123
not be effective anymore.
I wouldn't see my shadow on the

651
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:19,071
fog.
So I only had a small time

652
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:22,057
window, maybe thirty seconds,
maybe one minute.

653
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:25,822
But I succeeded and you will
see w- Saint Walter coming up.

654
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,262
There is Saint Walter.
You can see here my arm and you

655
00:39:29,262 --> 00:39:32,191
can see here my
camera.

656
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:38,146
The camera must be exactly at
the center of the glory.

657
00:39:38,146 --> 00:39:43,877
And that's where it is.
I have the camera right here

658
00:39:43,877 --> 00:39:50,281
and here you see the rest of my
body, isn't that terrific?

659
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:54,888
This can be used as proof
sooner or later.

660
00:39:54,888 --> 00:39:57,697
OK.
Back to our last three

661
00:39:57,697 --> 00:40:02,079
questions.
The last three questions deal

662
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,859
with
the polarization of the bow.

663
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:11,29
Are the bows polarized?
And the answer is yes,

664
00:40:11,29 --> 00:40:16,509
they are enormously polarized.
Why are they polarized?

665
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:22,221
You can answer that question.
But I will answer it for you.

666
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:28,228
The light that contributes to
the rainbow is the light whereby

667
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:33,94
the minimum angle for delta is
about a hundred thirty-eight

668
00:40:33,94 --> 00:40:38,469
degrees and if you go back to
that

669
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:43,81
first transparency you will see
that that's the case when the

670
00:40:43,81 --> 00:40:47,459
angle of incidence is about
sixty degrees.

671
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:52,532
You can download that again.
And that means that the angle

672
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:55,736
of refraction is about forty
degrees.

673
00:40:55,736 --> 00:41:00,097
Forty degrees is very close to
the Brewster angle.

674
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:05,348
The Brewster angle if you go
from water to air you -- medium

675
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:11,371
where you are is water and
you bounce it off this medium,

676
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:16,049
so you go from water to air,
the tangent of the Brewster

677
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:21,152
angle is N two divided by N one.
N two is where you're going.

678
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,364
That's air.
So this is one.

679
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:26,766
N one is where you are.
That's the water.

680
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:31,784
Let's just call that the index
of refraction one point three

681
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:34,761
three.
If you calculate now what the

682
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:39,864
Brewster angle is you will find
that the Brewster angle theta

683
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:44,447
Brewster
is about thirty-seven degrees.

684
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:49,275
That is only three degrees
different from this angle which

685
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:53,596
is the crucial one which
contributes to the rainbow.

686
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:58,424
So you're only three degrees
away from the Brewster angle.

687
00:41:58,424 --> 00:42:02,914
So what happens as this light
comes in i will make a a

688
00:42:02,914 --> 42:08
separate drawing
