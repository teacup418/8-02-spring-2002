00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,5



2
00:00:00,5 --> 00:00:04,441
I'm Walter Lewin.
My lectures will in general not

3
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:09,122
be a repeat of your book but
they will be complementary to

4
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:11,832
the book.
The book will support my

5
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:14,871
lectures.
My lectures will support the

6
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:17,581
book.
You will not see any tedious

7
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:21,934
derivations in my lectures.
For that we have the book.

8
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:26,861
But I will stress the concepts
and I will make you see beyond

9
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,653
the equations,
beyond the concepts.

10
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:33,924
I will show you whether you
like it

11
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:36,515
or not that physics is
beautiful.

12
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:39,187
And you may even start to like
it.

13
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:42,912
I suggest you do not slip up,
not even one day,

14
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:47,446
eight oh two is not easy.
We have new concepts every week

15
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:51,09
and before you know you may be
too far behind.

16
00:00:51,09 --> 00:00:54,491
Electricity and magnetism is
all around us.

17
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:57,73
We have electric lights.
Electric clocks.

18
00:00:57,73 --> 00:01:00,321
We have microphones,
calculators,

19
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,264
televisions,
VCRs, radio,

20
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:05,099
computers.
Light

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,795
itself is an electromagnetic
phenomenon as radio waves are.

22
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:14,491
The colors of the rainbow in
the blue sky are there because

23
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,216
of electricity.
And I will teach you about that

24
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,483
in this course.
Cars, planes,

25
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:23,884
trains can only run because of
electricity.

26
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:28,58
Horses need electricity because
muscle contractions require

27
00:01:28,58 --> 00:01:31,981
electricity.
Your nerve system is driven by

28
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:35,544
electricity.
Atoms, molecule,

29
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:40,199
all chemical reactions exist
because of electricity.

30
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,576
You could not see without
electricity.

31
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:47,683
Your heart would not beat
without electricity.

32
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:52,065
And you could not even think
without electricity,

33
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:57,815
though I realize that even with
electricity some of you may have

34
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:02,288
a problem with that.
The modern picture of an atom

35
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:07,673
is a nucleus which is very small
compared to the size of the

36
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:13,029
atom.
The nucleus has protons which

37
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:19,725
are positively charged and it
has neutrons which have no

38
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:23,62
charge.
The mass of the proton is

39
00:02:23,62 --> 00:02:29,586
approximately the same as the
mass of the neutron.

40
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:35,429
It's about six point seven
times ten to the minus

41
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:41,759
twenty-seventh kilograms.
One point seven.

42
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,447
The positive charges here with
the nucleons,

43
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:49,648
with the neutrons,
and then we have electrons in a

44
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:53,592
cloud around it.
And if the atom is neutral the

45
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:58,48
number of electrons and the
number of protons is the same.

46
00:02:58,48 --> 00:03:02,853
If you take one electron off
you get a positive ion.

47
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:07,14
If you add an electron then you
get a negative ion.

48
00:03:07,14 --> 00:03:11,085
The charge of the electron is
the

49
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:13,45
same as the charge of the
proton.

50
00:03:13,45 --> 00:03:17,221
That's why the number is the
same for neutral atoms.

51
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:21,361
The mass of the electron is
about eighteen hundred thirty

52
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:24,392
times smaller than the mass of
the proton.

53
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:27,718
It's therefore negligibly small
in most cases.

54
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:30,75
All the mass of an atom is in
the nucleus.

55
00:03:30,75 --> 00:03:34,52
If I take six billion atoms
lined up touching other,

56
00:03:34,52 --> 00:03:38,808
I take six billion because
that's about about the number of

57
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:43,244
people on earth.
Then you would only have a

58
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:48,797
length of sixty centimeters.
Gives you an idea of how small

59
00:03:48,797 --> 00:03:53,106
the atoms are.
The nucleus has a size of about

60
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:56,553
ten to the minus twelfth
centimeters.

61
00:03:56,553 --> 00:04:01,724
And the atom itself is about
ten thousand times larger.

62
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:06,894
The cloud of electrons.
Which is about ten to the minus

63
00:04:06,894 --> 00:04:11,491
eight centimeters.
And if you line six billion of

64
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:17,989
those up you only get this much.
Already in six hundred BC,

65
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:23,043
it was known that if you rub
amber that it can attract pieces

66
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:26,833
of dry leaves.
And the Greek word for amber is

67
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,201
electron.
So that's where electricity got

68
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:33,823
its name from.
In the sev- sixteenth century

69
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:37,444
there were more substances known
to do this.

70
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:42,077
For instance glass and sulfur.
And it was also known and

71
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:47,13
written that when people were
bored at parties that the women

72
00:04:47,13 --> 00:04:51,462
would rub
their amber jewelry and would

73
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:55,762
touch frogs which then would
start jumping of desperation

74
00:04:55,762 --> 00:05:00,062
which people considered to be
fun, not understanding what

75
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:04,668
actually was happening to the
amber nor what was happening to

76
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,586
the frogs.
In the eighteenth century it

77
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:11,732
was discovered that there are
two types of electricity.

78
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:15,725
One if you rub glass and
another if you rub rubber or

79
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:19,717
amber for that matter.
Let's call one A and the other

80
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:23,454
B.
It was known that A repels A

81
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:28,498
and B repels B but A attracts B.
And it was Benjamin Franklin

82
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:32,618
without any knowledge of
electrons and protons who

83
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:37,495
introduced the idea that all
substances are penetrated with

84
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:41,194
what he called electric fluid,
electric fire.

85
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:45,903
And he stated if you get too
much of the fire then you're

86
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:50,864
positively charged and if you
have a deficiency of that fire

87
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:54,288
then you're
negatively charged.

88
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,907
He introduced the sign
convention and he decided that

89
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:02,083
if you rub glass that that is an
excess of fire and he called

90
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,563
that therefore positive.
You will see later in this

91
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:09,182
course why this choice he had
fifty percent chance is

92
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:12,592
extremely unfortunate but we
have to live with it.

93
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:16,42
So if you take this fluid
according to Benjamin Franklin

94
00:06:16,42 --> 00:06:20,666
and bring it from one substance
to the other then the one that

95
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,728
gets an excess becomes
positively charged but

96
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:27,881
automatically
as a consequence of that the

97
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:31,515
one from which you take the
fluid becomes negatively

98
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,081
charged.
And so that's the whole idea

99
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,432
behind the conservation of
charge.

100
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:40,138
You cannot create charge.
If you create plus then you

101
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:44,271
automatically create minus.
Plus and plus repel each other.

102
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,552
Minus and minus repel each
other.

103
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:50,542
And plus and minus attract.
And Benjamin Franklin who did

104
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:54,462
experiments also noticed that
the more fire you have the

105
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:57,274
stronger the
forces.

106
00:06:57,274 --> 00:07:02,863
The closer these objects are to
each other the stronger the

107
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:06,332
forces.
And there are some substances

108
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:12,018
that he noticed which conduct
this fluid, which conduct this

109
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:15,487
fire, and they are called
conductors.

110
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:21,365
If I have a glass rod as I have
here and I rub it then it gets

111
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:25,509
this positive charge that we
just discussed.

112
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:29,942
So here is this rod and I rub
it

113
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:34,026
with some silk and it will get
positively charged.

114
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:38,943
What happens now to an object
that I bring close to this rod

115
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:42,611
and I will start off with taking
a conductor.

116
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:47,362
And the reason why I choose a
conductor is that conductors

117
00:07:47,362 --> 00:07:52,529
have a small fraction of their
electrons which are not bound to

118
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:57,113
atoms but which can freely move
around in the conductor.

119
00:07:57,113 --> 00:08:02,365
That's characteristic for a
conductor, for metals.

120
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:05,016
That's not the case with
nonconductors.

121
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:08,714
There the all electrons are
fixed to individual atoms.

122
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:12,551
So here we have a certain
fraction of electrons that can

123
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:15,412
wander around.
What's going to happen that

124
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,319
electrons want to be attracted
by these positive charges.

125
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,622
Plus and minus attract each
other.

126
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:25,878
And so some of these electrons
which can freely move will move

127
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:29,018
in this direction and so the
plus stay behind.

128
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:34,6
This process we call induction.
You get sort of a polarization.

129
00:08:34,6 --> 00:08:38,063
You get a charge division.
It's a very small effect,

130
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:41,933
perhaps only one in ten to the
thirteen electrons that was

131
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:45,736
originally here will end up here
but that's all it takes.

132
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:49,878
So we get a polarization and we
get a little bit more negative

133
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:53,545
charge on the right side than we
have on the left side.

134
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:57,619
And so what's going to happen
is since the attraction between

135
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:01,557
these two will be stronger than
the repelling force between

136
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:05,428
these two because the distance
is smaller and Franklin had

137
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:09,695
already noticed the
shorter the distance the

138
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:13,189
stronger the force.
What will happen is that if

139
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:17,518
this object is free to move it
will move towards this rod.

140
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:21,772
And this is the first thing
that I would like you to see.

141
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:25,949
I have here a conductor that is
a balloon, helium-filled

142
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:28,683
balloon.
And I will rub this rod with

143
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:31,341
silk.
And as I approach that balloon

144
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:34,835
you will see that the balloon
comes to the rod.

145
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:40,456
I will then try to rub with
that rod several times on that

146
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:43,467
balloon.
It will take a while perhaps

147
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:47,65
because the rod itself is a very
good nonconductor.

148
00:09:47,65 --> 00:09:52,25
It's not so easy to get charge
exchange between the two.

149
00:09:52,25 --> 00:09:57,186
But if I do it long enough I
can certainly make that balloon

150
00:09:57,186 --> 00:10:00,197
positive.
Then they're both positive.

151
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:03,125
And then they will repel each
other.

152
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:08,144
But first the induction part
whereby you will see the balloon

153
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:13,673
come to the glass rod.
These experiments work best

154
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:16,287
when it is dry.
In the winter.

155
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:21,875
They don't work so well when it
is humid so it's a good time to

156
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,759
teach eight oh two in the
winter.

157
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,446
OK there we go this should be
positively charged now.

158
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:33,232
And the balloon wants to come
to the glass.

159
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,575
You see that?
Very clearly.

160
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:37,018
Come on baby.
OK.

161
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:43,528
So now I will try to get this
balloon charged a little so

162
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:49,073
there is a change of electrons
that go from the balloon to the

163
00:10:49,073 --> 00:10:52,346
glass.
And the glass doesn't it's not

164
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:57,709
a conductor itself so it is not
always so easy to get charge

165
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:01,073
exchanges.
OK let's see whether I have

166
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:06,163
succeeded now in making the
balloon positively charged as

167
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:10,618
well as the glass rod.
If that's the case then the

168
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:16,269
balloon is not going to like me.
The balloon will now be

169
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:18,762
repelled.
And you see that very clearly.

170
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,533
To show you now that there are
indeed two different kinds of

171
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:26,368
electricity if I now rub with
cat fur by tradition we do that

172
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:30,266
with cat fur I don't know why by
tradition we use silk for the

173
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,503
glass.
So if we do this with cat fur

174
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:35,06
now then this becomes negatively
charged.

175
00:11:35,06 --> 00:11:37,872
Remember there were two types
of electricity.

176
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:41,132
And since that balloon is
positively charged now the

177
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:43,688
balloon will come to me.
And there it is.

178
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:47,139
Now it comes to me.
So you've seen

179
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,24
for the first time now clearly
that there are two different

180
00:11:52,24 --> 00:11:56,636
kinds of electricity.
The positive charge is chosen

181
00:11:56,636 --> 00:12:01,737
by Franklin on the glass rod and
the negative charge on the

182
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:04,99
rubber.
So now you may think that if I

183
00:12:04,99 --> 00:12:10,354
approach a nonconducting balloon
with a glass rod and I have a

184
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:15,718
nonconducting balloon here you
may think now that this balloon

185
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:21,652
will not come to the glass rod
because there are no free

186
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:24,666
electrons.
So these electrons cannot

187
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:28,971
freely move and so you don't get
this polarization.

188
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:33,621
You don't get this induction.
But that is not the case.

189
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:36,463
And this is actually quite
subtle.

190
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:39,907
You have to look now at the
atomic scale.

191
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:43,007
If I take an atom like you have
here.

192
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:48,173
You have positive charge and
you have the electrons here in a

193
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:52,25
cloud
around the positive nucleus.

194
00:12:52,25 --> 00:12:56,463
If I bring a glass rod
positively charged nearby then

195
00:12:56,463 --> 00:13:00,028
these electrons which are stuck
to the atoms,

196
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:05,133
they cannot freely move like in
conductors, however will spend a

197
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:10,156
little bit more time on the side
where the glass rod is because

198
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,855
they feel attracted by the glass
rod, whereas the nuclei if

199
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:18,339
anything want to go away from
the glass rod,

200
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,309
so what you're going to see is
that

201
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:26,438
in a way if I started off with
a spherical atom let's suppose

202
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:30,499
this were a spherical atom or a
spherical molecule then what

203
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:34,628
will happen is that you get sort
of a shape like this and the

204
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:38,619
electrons spend a little bit
more time here than they spend

205
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:42,748
here and that means that I have
actually polarized that atom.

206
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:46,602
If the electrons spend more
time on this side of the atom

207
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:50,318
than on this side I have also
created the phenomenon of

208
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:54,585
induction and I therefore expect
that this side

209
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:59,144
becomes more negative than that
side.

210
00:13:59,144 --> 00:14:06,238
And I can show you that in a
nice way with a transparency

211
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:13,965
whereby I have plus and minus
signs and I have equal number of

212
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:19,791
plus and minus signs.
So they represent neutral

213
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,958
atoms.
There you see them.

214
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,138
Boy.
It's a little dirty but maybe

215
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:31,325
see I can
clean it a little.

216
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:31,792
OK.
OK.

217
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,827
So here we go.
So notice there are equal

218
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:39,262
amount of pluses and minuses,
so think of the plus and the

219
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:43,152
minuses as one neutral atom.
Just a representation.

220
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:47,743
Now I'm holding a glass rod on
this side which is positively

221
00:14:47,743 --> 00:14:50,7
charged.
And so each atom the electrons

222
00:14:50,7 --> 00:14:55,369
want to go a little bit to this
side and so the nucleus stays

223
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,326
behind.
And if each atom does that this

224
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:03,914
is what's going to happen.
And now notice what you end up

225
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:06,439
with.
In the middle of the substance

226
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,614
plus and minuses cancel each
other out again.

227
00:15:09,614 --> 00:15:13,799
But on the right side you have
created a negatively charged

228
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,767
layer and on the left side you
have created a positively

229
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,942
charged layer.
And so in a way you have again

230
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,683
induction.
So even in the nonconducting

231
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:27,94
objects this side will turn
negative and this side will turn

232
00:15:27,94 --> 00:15:32,197
positive and therefore if I
approach a nonconducting balloon

233
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:36,784
with a glass
rod I will also see the balloon

234
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:39,832
come to me.
And so I can easily show you

235
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:42,567
that.
It doesn't make any difference

236
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:46,396
whether I choose glass or
whether I choose rubber.

237
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:50,382
I can do it with both.
Nonconducting balloons always

238
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,602
have a potential problem.
The potential problem is that

239
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:58,665
they can be charged by
themselves just like the metal

240
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:01,557
balloons can be charged by
themselves.

241
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:07,316
However, if I touch the metal
balloon then any charges there

242
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:12,026
will immediately flow through me
to the earth we will understand

243
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:14,942
that later.
Because this is a conductor.

244
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:19,053
That remember the electric
fluid is conducted by a metal

245
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:22,642
but not by a nonconductor.
So with this it's more

246
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:25,632
difficult.
Even if I kiss it and touch it

247
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:29,295
it's not clear that I can take
all the charge off.

248
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:32,734
In fact by doing that I may
even make it worse.

249
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:36,398
Let's hope that it is not
charged

250
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:41,899
too much and let's approach it
with this glass rod and see

251
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:47,69
whether I can convince you that
indeed it's coming to the rod

252
00:16:47,69 --> 00:16:52,709
not because of the free
electrons but because of that

253
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:54,157
process.
Oh boy.

254
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:57,342
Ho.
And it should also do the same

255
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:01,975
with rubber I hope.
If it were negatively it'd go

256
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:05,063
away.
Ha it does go away so it is

257
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:12,349
negatively charged you see that.
By touching it I actually

258
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:18,73
probably charged it and there's
not much I can do about it.

259
00:17:18,73 --> 00:17:22,25
Very difficult to get charge
off.

260
00:17:22,25 --> 00:17:28,849
I already had a suspicion when
I approached it with the glass

261
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:32,92
it was too eager to come to the
glass.

262
00:17:32,92 --> 00:17:38,2
Still negatively charged.
That's the way it goes.

263
00:17:38,2 --> 00:17:43,259
It's not because the
demonstration

264
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,962
failed but it's because the
balloon is charged and doesn't

265
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:52,417
want to give it up because it's
a it is a nonconductor.

266
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:57,12
Friction can cause electric
charge and that's exactly what

267
00:17:57,12 --> 00:18:01,905
happened when I touched this
balloon and tried to discharge

268
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:04,71
it.
Through friction I may actually

269
00:18:04,71 --> 00:18:08,505
have charged it.
If I take these party balloons

270
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:13,29
that all of you may have seen
and you just rub them on your

271
00:18:13,29 --> 00:18:18,24
shirt on your trousers they
stick to my hand.

272
00:18:18,24 --> 00:18:21,577
They have charge on them.
Whether it's positive or

273
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:24,572
negative I don't know,
I don't even remember.

274
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:27,908
It's not important.
And so when I bring them to my

275
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:31,925
hand, my hand is not a good
conductor but you get induction,

276
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:36,011
this phenomenon that we just
discussed and so the two attract

277
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:38,734
each other.
The positive and the negative

278
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:42,342
side attract each other.
And you can stick them on the

279
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,793
ceiling.
Or you can stick them on the

280
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:47,313
board.
You can decorate your room that

281
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:50,932
way.
Very pretty isn't it.

282
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:55,528
All that you can do now because
of eight oh two.

283
00:18:55,528 --> 00:19:01,297
Now these heavy balloons may be
a little bit more difficult.

284
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:06,577
Also I'm wearing cotton.
If you wear nylon or polyester

285
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:10,781
it's much better.
It's much easier to get oh

286
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:16,453
that's good, that's a nice one,
I think we need a blue one.

287
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:20,702
There we go.
So you see friction causes

288
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,702
electricity.
That's of course why the silk

289
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:28,238
when we rubbed the glass and the
cat fur we rub the rubber then

290
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:32,263
we create charge on one.
Of course if you make the glass

291
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:36,653
positively charged your silk
will be automatically negatively

292
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,507
charged.
When you comb your hair you may

293
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:43,604
have noticed with dry weather
that you hear some cracking

294
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:46,092
noise.
Cracking noise means sparks.

295
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:49,824
And you will learn all about
sparks

296
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:53,568
in this course though not
today.

297
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:58,4
But you can hear it if you're
very quiet.

298
00:19:58,4 --> 00:20:02,991
And as you do that you charge
the comb.

299
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:07,34
I can hear the cracking.
Interesting.

300
00:20:07,34 --> 00:20:14,105
So the comb is now charged.
Probably so am I and there it

301
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:15,313
comes.
See.

302
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:22,199
It's not as good as the glass
but same idea.

303
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:27,98
If you take your shirt off and
you make it and you make it dark

304
00:20:27,98 --> 00:20:33,762
in your dormitory and you stand
in front of a mirror an amazing

305
00:20:33,762 --> 00:20:37,493
experience.
And I'd be happy to do it for

306
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:42,435
you because but I told you I
really wear cotton and it

307
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:45,419
doesn't work with cotton so
well.

308
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,429
You really have to do it with a
nylon shirt.

309
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:53,813
And when you take that nylon
shirt

310
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:58,667
off not only do you hear the
cracking but you actually see

311
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:02,33
the glow of these teeny weeny
little sparks.

312
00:21:02,33 --> 00:21:05,225
You actually are like a light
bulb.

313
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:08,632
It is an experiment that you
cannot miss.

314
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:12,465
And I would suggest you try
that this weekend.

315
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:15,957
Do it with a friend.
That's even more fun.

316
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:20,386
We'll all perhaps remember when
you just walk around.

317
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:23,452
Do your normal things during
the day.

318
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:29,531
There are rugs in rooms and
you want to leave the room and

319
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:32,796
you touch the doorknob and you
get a shock.

320
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:36,371
It's a spark that flies over.
It's electricity.

321
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:40,879
Even when you touch a person
you sometimes feel this shock.

322
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:45,232
When you cook and you take
saran wrap off these rolls the

323
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:50,051
damn stuff just doesn't want to
come off because as you roll it

324
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:54,559
off there is friction and it
gets charged and it often gets

325
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,232
crumpled up and it's very bad,
very difficult to handle it.

326
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:05,017
You've all experienced that.
Also cellophane around boxes

327
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:08,178
with chocolate the same thing
happens.

328
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:13,305
As you take it off you charge
it, whether you like it or not.

329
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:17,833
I now want to do an experiment
and I need a volunteer.

330
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:22,789
I need a student who actually
is wearing preferably not all

331
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:27,915
cotton but I think Simon you
have a beautiful wonderful nylon

332
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:30,478
parka.
So if you are willing to

333
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:35,922
sacrifice a
little bit for the sake of

334
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:41,376
science and come over here and
sit down here.

335
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:46,21
Just relax.
Make sure that your feet are

336
00:22:46,21 --> 00:22:48,442
off the ground.
OK.

337
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:55,755
So what I'm going to do now
Simon I'm going to beat you with

338
00:22:55,755 --> 00:23:00,465
cat fur.
And as I beat you with cat fur

339
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:04,721
you
will get charged and since I

340
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:09,684
don't want you to be the only
person who suffers under this

341
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:14,733
experiment I will also stand on
an insulated stool so if you

342
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:19,697
become for instance positively
charged I don't know whether

343
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:24,489
it's positive or negative I
would get the other amount of

344
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:27,313
charge.
So we share in the charge.

345
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:32,02
And as I beat you you will
charge up more and more and I

346
00:23:32,02 --> 00:23:37,373
will charge
up more and more and then we

347
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:44,375
will have to convince the class
that that we are both charged.

348
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:50,917
And we will do that in a way
that will be hopefully rather

349
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:55,738
convincing.
I let me just start beating you

350
00:23:55,738 --> 00:24:00,099
a little bit.
To make you feel at home.

351
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:03,313
We know each other right.
OK.

352
00:24:03,313 --> 00:24:12,194
Now of course as I mentioned to
you these experiments work well

353
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:19,066
when it is dry and so if you are
too wet it won't work.

354
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:26,066
But let's see if you sweat a
little bit too much then it

355
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:30,393
doesn't work too well.
So we ready?

356
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:35,484
I have here in my hand a neon
flash tube.

357
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:42,582
And although we don't know
yet what voltage is because we

358
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:47,614
will learn about that in this
course, to get a good flash out

359
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:51,304
of these you need about a few
thousand volts.

360
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:56,253
And so we will see and we'll
make it dark shortly and I will

361
00:24:56,253 --> 00:25:00,195
hold the flashlight,
the flashlight in one hand,

362
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:04,808
the neon discharge tube,
and then Simon will touch it on

363
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:08,666
the other side.
And if we've succeeded then you

364
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:13,699
may see some light.
So Simon look at me first,

365
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:19,691
don't touch it yet,
because we're going to make it

366
00:25:19,691 --> 00:25:24,339
all the way dark.
You know where it is,

367
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:28,864
it's there, OK,
make it darker Marcos.

368
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:31,066
Touch it.
Touch it.

369
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:34,979
OK, try it again,
touch it again.

370
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,569
OK.
Thank you.

371
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:43,174
Can we have some light.
[applause] Thank you very much.

372
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:49,981
Equal charges repel each other.
I've shown that,

373
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,566
the demonstration with the
balloons.

374
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:56,85
Here we have an instrument
which is called the Vandegraaff.

375
00:25:56,85 --> 00:26:00,913
It's named after Professor
Vandegraaff, who invented it.

376
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:04,162
It was an MIT professor.
And this instrument,

377
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,372
which I will not discuss in any
detail though but you will

378
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:12,804
understand it later on in the
course, I'll tell you all about

379
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,611
it later.
Just think of this instrument

380
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:20,912
as a super amber rod.
And although we don't know yet

381
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,851
what voltage is,
I mentioned already the twenty

382
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:30,245
thousand volts between Simon and
me, in this instrument you have

383
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:34,612
to think in terms of several
hundred thousand volts.

384
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:38,037
So this instrument is not
without danger.

385
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:42,918
But that of course makes it
more exciting to work with it.

386
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:49,083
So it's a super amber rod and
what I will do first now is to

387
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:55,946
put some confetti on top and
when we turn on the Vandegraaff

388
00:26:55,946 --> 00:27:01,529
the confetti may at first go to
the charged dome,

389
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:07,927
it is already on top of it,
and when it picks up some of

390
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:14,79
the charge it will then spread
out because it it will repel.

391
00:27:14,79 --> 00:27:21,42
So let's get some some light on
there which will make it a

392
00:27:21,42 --> 00:27:28,4
little bit better to see.
Let me put some of this

393
00:27:28,4 --> 00:27:37,95
on top.
It's just regular confetti,

394
00:27:37,95 --> 00:27:50,029
pieces of paper.
All right now all I have to

395
00:27:50,029 --> 00:28:06,031
remember is how to start the
most of the action has already

396
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:14,332
occurred.
I will put a little bit more

397
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:21,288
on.
[laughter] If you see sparks

398
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:31,16
don't worry yet.
[laughter] Put some more on.

399
00:28:31,16 --> 00:28:41,032
More and nothing left for the
second

400
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:45,6
class.
[laughter] Make it perhaps a

401
00:28:45,6 --> 00:28:50,033
little darker.
Ah that's too dark.

402
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:55,944
[laughter] OK.
We'll try it once more give it

403
00:28:55,944 --> 00:29:00,78
a zap so look at the confetti on
top.

404
00:29:00,78 --> 00:29:05,214
And I think it's quite
convincing.

405
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:10,05
Some of the confetti will stay
there.

406
00:29:10,05 --> 00:29:19,46
Well that's the reason that
it's not a good conductor and

407
00:29:19,46 --> 00:29:28,23
so it get it first sucked in and
if it doesn't get charge of the

408
00:29:28,23 --> 00:29:33,66
Vandegraaff then it will not
spread out.

409
00:29:33,66 --> 00:29:39,228
All right.
So now let's try for the first

410
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:44,935
time to be a little bit more
quantitative.

411
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:51,2
If I take two charges and we
use in

412
00:29:51,2 --> 00:29:56,646
general we use for charge the
symbol Q.

413
00:29:56,646 --> 00:30:03,095
So here we have Q one.
And here we have Q two.

414
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:09,831
And let's say they're separated
by a distance R.

415
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:18,143
And the unit vector in the
direction from one to two I call

416
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:24,604
that R roof one-two.
The roof stands for unit

417
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:27,58
vector.
These charges are equal,

418
00:30:27,58 --> 00:30:32,861
both minus or both plus,
then they will repel each other

419
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:37,757
and so here there is a force F
which I call one-two.

420
00:30:37,757 --> 00:30:43,134
It is the force on two due to
number one and since action

421
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:49,279
equals minus reaction force here
is to one equal in magnitude but

422
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,695
a hundred eighty degrees in
opposite direction.

423
00:30:53,695 --> 00:31:00,748
Coulomb, the French physicist,
who did a lot of research on

424
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:05,798
this in the nineteenth
eighteenth century actually.

425
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,838
Coulomb found the following
relationship.

426
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:15,394
That the force is proportional
to the product of the two

427
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:18,828
charges.
So it's Q one times Q two.

428
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:24,686
Times a constant which nowadays
we call Coulomb's constant,

429
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:29,333
K.
Divided by the distance between

430
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:33,218
these charges squared.
And it is in direction of the

431
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:36,036
unit vector that goes from one
to two.

432
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:39,236
This is the force on number two
due to one.

433
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:42,816
And notice that this equation
is sign sensitive.

434
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:47,387
Because if Q one and Q two are
both negative the source is in

435
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:51,5
the the force is in this
direction and if they are both

436
00:31:51,5 --> 00:31:55,233
positive it's also in this
direction as I have it.

437
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:59,499
However if the if one is
positive and one is negative you

438
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:04,102
get minus
this direction so this force

439
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:09,16
flips over and that one then
obviously also flips over.

440
00:32:09,16 --> 00:32:14,499
In the SI units in this course
we will use for the unit of

441
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:18,714
charge the coulomb named after
this great man.

442
00:32:18,714 --> 00:32:23,491
One coulomb charge is a
horrendous amount of charge.

443
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:27,612
More than you will ever see in
your lifetime.

444
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,89
We normally work with
microcoulombs,

445
00:32:30,89 --> 00:32:37,428
sometimes even less than that.
The charge of one proton,

446
00:32:37,428 --> 00:32:42,745
which is exactly the same as
the charge of one electron,

447
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:48,642
is approximately one point six
times ten to the minus nineteen

448
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:52,025
coulomb.
So one coulomb is something

449
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:57,535
like six times ten to the
eighteen protons or electrons if

450
00:32:57,535 --> 00:33:02,658
the charge is negative.
This constant K in SI units is

451
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:06,428
nine times ten to the
ninth.

452
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:12,034
And the unit you can find out
because you know that this is

453
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:17,64
newtons, this is coulomb squared
and this is square meters.

454
00:33:17,64 --> 00:33:23,052
So the unit is newton square
meters newtons square meters

455
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:28,368
divided by square coulombs.
But that's not so important.

456
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:31,557
No one ever thinks of it that
way.

457
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:36,099
For historical reasons which
may at

458
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:41,506
times be a pain in the neck for
you we write for K one divided

459
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:46,115
by four pi epsilon zero.
There is nothing magic about

460
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:49,217
that.
It's just a historical reason.

461
00:33:49,217 --> 00:33:54,446
And so one divided by four pi
epsilon zero is nine times ten

462
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:57,725
to the ninth.
That's all that matters.

463
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:02,955
This epsilon zero has a name
it's called the permittivity of

464
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:06,588
free space.
But you can forget about that.

465
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:12,818
It's not important the name.
Notice that there is a clear

466
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:17,138
parallel with gravity.
Newton's law of gravity that

467
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,457
the force, which in that case is
always attracting,

468
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:25,69
gravity never repels,
is the product of two masses

469
00:34:25,69 --> 00:34:30,701
and then you have here the
gravitational constant and again

470
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:35,279
you have the distance squared.
So there is an enormous

471
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:39,771
parallel between the two.
There's a great beauty that

472
00:34:39,771 --> 00:34:43,831
electricity acts in a way that
is

473
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:47,983
very parallel to the way that
gravity works.

474
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:52,23
If I added a third charge,
for instance here,

475
00:34:52,23 --> 00:34:58,119
Q three, and if now I want to
know what the force is on Q two,

476
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:03,815
then I use the superposition
principle which we've used many

477
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:08,835
times in eight oh one,
and we say OK the net force on

478
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:15,786
number two is the force due to
number one plus the force from

479
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:19,619
number three.
If number three if this is

480
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:25,616
positive and this is positive
and this were negative then this

481
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:29,449
force would be in this
direction, F one,

482
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:35,347
F three two and then the net
force on number two would be the

483
00:35:35,347 --> 00:35:40,164
vectorial sum of these two.
Is it obvious that the

484
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:44,194
superposition principal works?
Not at all.

485
00:35:44,194 --> 00:35:49,594
It's not at all obvious.
Do we believe in it?

486
00:35:49,594 --> 00:35:52,591
Yes we do.
Why do we believe in it?

487
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:57,528
Because it's consistent with
all experiments that we have

488
00:35:57,528 --> 00:36:00,701
done.
But the superposition principle

489
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:05,549
which is very powerful is really
not a matter of course.

490
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:08,546
But it works.
We can always use it.

491
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:11,983
And we will.
If you compare eight oh one

492
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:16,479
with eight oh two thereby
comparing electricity with

493
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:22,518
gravity you will
see that electric forces are

494
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:27,461
way more powerful than
gravitational forces.

495
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:34,358
And the way I can best show you
that is by taking two protons

496
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:41,14
which are a distance D apart.
Here is a proton and here is a

497
00:36:41,14 --> 00:36:46,887
pro- proton and they are
separated by a distance D.

498
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:52,874
They repel each other.
And the force by which they

499
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:57,747
repel each other is of course
extremely easy to calculate.

500
00:36:57,747 --> 00:37:01,68
We know Coulomb's law.
That law is called after

501
00:37:01,68 --> 00:37:03,818
Coulomb.
And so the force,

502
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:08,178
the electric force with which
they repel each other,

503
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:11,854
this is just the magnitude now
of the force,

504
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:16,899
is the charge of the proton
which is one point six times ten

505
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:22,199
to the minus nineteen but I have
to square that,

506
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,5
I have to multiply it by
Coulomb's constant,

507
00:37:25,5 --> 00:37:29,875
which is nine times ten to the
ninth, and I divide it by D

508
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,485
squared.
That's the electric force.

509
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:35,632
If I want to know the
gravitational force,

510
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:39,7
which is the force with which
they attract each other,

511
00:37:39,7 --> 00:37:43,768
these are repelling forces,
but I just want magnitudes

512
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:47,453
here, then I have to take the
mass of the proton,

513
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:52,135
which is one point seven times
ten to the minus twenty-seven I

514
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:56,05
have to square that remember M
one

515
00:37:56,05 --> 00:38:00,026
times M two times the
gravitational constant.

516
00:38:00,026 --> 00:38:05,087
The gravitational constant in
SI units is six point seven

517
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:10,51
times ten to the minus eleven
and I divide that by D squared.

518
00:38:10,51 --> 00:38:15,661
If now I compare the electric
force with the gravitational

519
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:20,451
force, so I divide one by the
other, notice that the D

520
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,343
cancels.
They both have D squared

521
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:27,048
downstairs.
And so you will easily be able

522
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:31,691
to
show that this ratio is roughly

523
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:36,3
ten to the thirty-six.
So the electric force is

524
00:38:36,3 --> 00:38:41,31
thirty-six orders of magnitude
more potent than the

525
00:38:41,31 --> 00:38:46,721
gravitational attraction.
This teaches you some respect

526
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:52,132
perhaps for eight oh two.
If these were the only forces

527
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:57,944
that acted on the protons and
you bring them in the nucleus

528
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:02,88
which has a size
of only ten to the minus

529
00:39:02,88 --> 00:39:07,85
twelfth centimeters then the
acceleration that the proton

530
00:39:07,85 --> 00:39:13,442
will experience is the electric
force divided by the mass of the

531
00:39:13,442 --> 00:39:15,128
proton.
F equals MA.

532
00:39:15,128 --> 00:39:19,655
Basis of eight oh one.
And if you take this electric

533
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:25,246
force when you make D ten to the
minus twelfth centimeters which

534
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:30,306
is ten to the minus fourteen
meters and you calculate this

535
00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:35,431
ratio you will find
that it is twenty-six orders of

536
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:39,257
magnitude higher than the
gravitational acceleration on

537
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:41,807
earth.
Twenty-six orders of magnitude

538
00:39:41,807 --> 00:39:44,216
higher.
So you wonder what the hell

539
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:48,184
holds the nucleus together.
If there is such a tremendous

540
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:51,655
force on these protons.
Well, what is holding them

541
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:55,41
together are the nuclear forces,
which we do not fully

542
00:39:55,41 --> 00:39:59,732
understand, but thank goodness
the nuclear forces are not part

543
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:03,274
of eight oh two so I will leave
that alone for now.

544
00:40:03,274 --> 00:40:06,887
So what holds our world
together?

545
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:11,377
Well on the nuclear scale ten
to the minus twelve centimeters

546
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:14,145
very important are the nuclear
forces.

547
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,736
On an atomic scale up to
thousands of kilometers,

548
00:40:17,736 --> 00:40:21,926
it's really electric forces
that hold our world together.

549
00:40:21,926 --> 00:40:25,817
But on a much larger scale,
planets and stars and the

550
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:29,632
galaxy, it is gravity that holds
our world together.

551
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:34,122
And now you may say ah that's
very inconsistent with what you

552
00:40:34,122 --> 00:40:38,686
just told us because didn't you
tell us that D

553
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:43
cancels if you compare gravity
with electricity.

554
00:40:43 --> 00:40:46,672
Yes, however,
most objects are neutral or

555
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:52,18
very close to neutral and so if
you take the earth it is very

556
00:40:52,18 --> 00:40:57,78
unlikely even that the earth as
a whole would have a charge of

557
00:40:57,78 --> 00:41:02,37
more than ten coulombs.
That probably is already an

558
00:41:02,37 --> 00:41:06,134
exaggeration.
So if I take the earth and I

559
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:11,641
take the moon and I put on both
a charge of ten

560
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:15,446
coulombs, here's the earth and
here's the moon,

561
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:20,326
and I put say just arbitrarily
ten coulombs here and that is

562
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:23,965
put on here either minus,
minus ten coulombs,

563
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:28,679
so they will attract each
other, but given their distance,

564
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:32,814
it's almost nothing.
The force is negligibly small.

565
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:37,446
But of course the force of
gravity, which is proportional

566
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:41,002
to their masses,
wins and in this particular

567
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:45,054
case if you take the earth and
the

568
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:50,427
moon the gravitational force
wins over the electric force by

569
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:55,891
twenty-five orders of magnitude.
So even though our immediate

570
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:59,988
surroundings are dominated by
electric forces,

571
00:41:59,988 --> 00:42:05,361
including your own body for
that matter, the behavior of the

572
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:09,732
universe on a large scale is
dictated by gravity.

573
00:42:09,732 --> 00:42:14,558
We will use various instruments
to measure charge in a

574
00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:20,906
quantitative way
and one of the instruments that

575
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:27,723
you will see we will use it
often in the lectures that are

576
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:31,789
to come, is called an
electroscope.

577
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:38,127
It's a very simple instrument.
In general it is just a

578
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:42,433
conducting rod.
It could be aluminum,

579
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:49,25
metal, and at the end are two
pieces of tinsel,

580
00:42:49,25 --> 00:42:53,956
two pieces of aluminum foil,
and often there is a nice knob

581
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:57,77
here, and if I touch this with a
charged object,

582
00:42:57,77 --> 00:43:02,476
then because this can conduct
electricity, this can conduct

583
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:07,588
the fire, as defined by Benjamin
Franklin, if I touch it with an

584
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:12,132
object which is positively
charged, then this object will

585
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:16,514
become positively charged.
If I touch it with an object

586
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:22,599
which is negatively charged it
will become negatively charged.

587
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,336
And you see now here these two
very light pieces of aluminum

588
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:31,832
foil will repel each other.
And so you will see that this

589
00:43:31,832 --> 00:43:35,847
shows a certain angle,
and the more charge there is

590
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:40,102
the larger that angle.
Sort of gives us a way of doing

591
00:43:40,102 --> 00:43:44,919
some quantitative measurements.
There are other electroscopes

592
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:49,334
which are not too different.
There's one central rod and

593
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:54,312
they would have one leaf hanging
there and when you charge that

594
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:59,286
one up then
this leaf will go out and if

595
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:04,028
the charge is more it will go
out even further.

596
00:44:04,028 --> 00:44:07,843
I don't have an electroscope
now here.

597
00:44:07,843 --> 00:44:14,338
But what I want you to see that
if I charge myself up and I hold

598
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:20,832
in my hands these Christmas tree
tinsels, that in a way if I get

599
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:26,4
enough charge on me,
then these tinsels will

600
00:44:26,4 --> 00:44:29,439
spread out.
It's an idea that immediately

601
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:34,074
follows from the fact that you
get a certain amount of charge,

602
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:37,949
whether it's negative charge
from me, or whether I'm

603
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:40,988
positively charged,
that doesn't make any

604
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:44,103
difference, these tinsels will
spread out.

605
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:48,206
And of course the best way I
can do that is if I charge

606
00:44:48,206 --> 00:44:51,929
myself with the Vandegraaff.
And as I said earlier

607
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:57,4
experiments of this nature are
not entirely without risk.

608
00:44:57,4 --> 00:45:02,182
And so there's always the
possibility of course that I

609
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:05,069
don't survive this
demonstration.

610
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:10,212
[laughter] But don't worry
because in that case there will

611
00:45:10,212 --> 00:45:15,716
be someone else who will lecture
eight oh two except he is not

612
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:19,235
likely to show this
demonstration again.

613
00:45:19,235 --> 00:45:24,739
[laughter] So you might as well
take a close look because this

614
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:28,439
may be the only time you will
ever see it.

615
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:33,492
So I will give you some nice
light on the Vandegraaff and

616
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:39,121
it's always a
scary moment for me,

617
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:44,673
sleepless nights about the
Vandegraaff.

618
00:45:44,673 --> 00:45:52,855
Am I going to turn it on,
Marcos, or you have the courage

619
00:45:52,855 --> 00:45:57,822
to turn it on?
You will turn it on?

620
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:04,982
OK, hold it Marcos,
this is too close for comfort.

621
00:46:04,982 --> 00:46:08,78
You ready?
Are you nervous?

622
00:46:08,78 --> 00:46:13,164
Feel.
[laughter] So look at the

623
00:46:13,164 --> 00:46:21,199
tinsels and try not to look at
me please.

624
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:28,207
Go ahead.
I am now a living electroscope.

625
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:38,018
[laughter] If the if the
weather is cooperating today and

626
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:47,654
if I had long hair you might
even see that my hair would

627
00:46:47,654 --> 00:46:59,066
start to act like
an electroscope.

628
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:18,437
We can try that too.
Why don't you throw it.

629
00:47:18,437 --> 00:47:36,029
[laughter] [applause]
Is it working?

630
00:47:36,029 --> 00:48:01,799
OK, well, this weekend make
sure you take this nylon shirt

631
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:29,377
off in front of the mirror and
enjoy your enjoy the experiment

632
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:42,036
at home.
Don't try this ever.

633
00:48:42,036 --> 48:47
See you Friday.
[applause]
