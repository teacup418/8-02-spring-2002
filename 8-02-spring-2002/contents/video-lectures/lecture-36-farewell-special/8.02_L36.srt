00:00:00 --> 00:00:01,333



2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:06,374
Today I would like to talk to
you about some of the research

3
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:09,622
that I did during my early days
at MIT.

4
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:12,442
It's a long time ago.
I got my Ph.

5
00:00:12,442 --> 0.

6
0. --> 00:00:15,006
in the Netherlands on nuclear
work and so the tension during

7
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:19,449
physics and I came over to MIT
in nineteen sixty-six.

8
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:23,124
I was supposed to be here only
for one year.

9
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,944
I had a one-year postdoc
position.

10
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:28,935
But I loved it so much I never
left.

11
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:33,88
I changed fields.
I joined the research group of

12
00:00:33,88 --> 00:00:37,143
Professor Bruno Rossi.
Here at MIT I changed from

13
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:39,454
nuclear physics to x-ray
astronomy.

14
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:41,698
X-ray astronomy speaks for
itself.

15
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:44,349
You're trying to do astronomy
in x-rays.

16
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:48,292
You cannot see any x-rays from
the ground because the earth

17
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:50,603
atmosphere absorbs them
completely.

18
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:54,275
So you have to go outside the
atmosphere unlike optical

19
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:57,946
astronomy and radio astronomy
which you can do from the

20
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:01,753
ground.
When I use the word x-rays I'm

21
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:06,111
thinking of the kind of x-rays
that your dentist would be

22
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:09,77
using, medical purposes,
about one to fifty kilo

23
00:01:09,77 --> 00:01:13,35
electron-volts.
And since all of you took eight

24
00:01:13,35 --> 00:01:17,709
oh two you should know by now
what a kilo electron-volts.

25
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:20,667
Uh optical light is two
electron volts,

26
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:24,092
where x-rays,
way more energetic than optical

27
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:26,894
light.
Uh during the Second World War

28
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:31,564
Werner von Braun in Peenemunde
developed under Hitler Germany

29
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:36,939
destructive rockets.
They were used to destroy the

30
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,433
Allies.
To destroy you and me.

31
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,39
And after the war,
around nineteen forty-eight,

32
00:01:43,39 --> 00:01:47,346
the Americans used these
rockets to do science.

33
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:52,335
They also got Werner von Braun
over to this country and for

34
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:55,603
reasons unknown to me he became
a hero.

35
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:59,904
They tried to observe x-rays
from the solar system.

36
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:04,033
And they found indeed that the
sun

37
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,653
emits x-rays.
The sun is very close.

38
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:09,722
So you may say well that's not
a surprise.

39
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:13,914
But it's really very unusual
because to create x-rays you

40
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:16,31
need extremely high
temperatures,

41
00:02:16,31 --> 00:02:19,304
which we didn't think existed
on the sun.

42
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:23,571
And if you take the power that
the sun puts out in x-rays,

43
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:27,763
this is joules per second now,
and you divide that by the

44
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:31,806
power in the optical and the
infrared light of the sun,

45
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:36,073
this symbol stands for sun,
that ratio is about ten to the

46
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,312
minus
seven.

47
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:42,741
So you must conclude that the
sun emits largely optical light

48
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:47,465
and infrared and that the amount
of x-rays is a modest byproduct.

49
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:49,975
Interesting as it is all by
itself.

50
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:54,256
In nineteen sixty-two several
scientists here in Cambridge,

51
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:57,209
Massachusetts,
among them Bruno Rossi and

52
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,047
Riccardo Giacconi and Herb
Gursky, made an attempt to

53
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,738
observe x-rays from stars
outside our solar system.

54
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:08,576
The odds were strongly against
them.

55
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:11,424
The detectors were not
sensitive enough.

56
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,439
If you take the sun and you
bring the sun to the nearest

57
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,017
stars, which is a distance say
of ten light-years,

58
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:23,324
then there would be no hope
that you would be able to detect

59
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:25,807
x-rays from an object like the
sun.

60
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:30,333
In fact the detectors were too
insensitive by about a factor of

61
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,473
one billion.
They tried anyhow and they were

62
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:35,955
successful.
They did indeed find to

63
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:40,555
everyone's surprise and joy,
they found x-rays

64
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:44,768
from at least one object
outside the solar system.

65
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,036
This object was later called
SCO X one.

66
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:52,336
SCO stands for the
constellation Scorpio in the sky

67
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:57,582
and X for x-rays and one for the
first source observed in that

68
00:03:57,582 --> 00:04:01,452
constellation.
We now know that this object is

69
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:05,494
a faint blue star.
And what is extremely special

70
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:10,74
about the object SCO X one is
that if you take the ratio x-ray

71
00:04:10,74 --> 00:04:15,728
power over optical power then
that ratio is

72
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:19,65
about ten to the third.
Compare that with the sun.

73
00:04:19,65 --> 00:04:22,932
This object,
we had no clue what it was in

74
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:27,575
those days, primarily emit
x-rays, and the optical emission

75
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:30,857
is a byproduct.
Whereas with the sun it is

76
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:34,059
reversed.
And so the burning question was

77
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:37,342
in those days what kind of
animal is this?

78
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:40,223
It must be a totally different
beast.

79
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:43,185
Something very different from
our sun.

80
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:47,727
And when I came to MIT in
nineteen sixty-six,

81
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:51,015
there were six sources known
outside our solar system.

82
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:53,56
And they were all discovered
with rockets.

83
00:04:53,56 --> 00:04:57,345
The rockets in those days could
spend about five minutes above

84
00:04:57,345 --> 00:05:01,006
the earth atmosphere and they
would quickly make a scan over

85
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:03,613
the sky, five minutes,
that's all they had.

86
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:06,157
And I joined the group of uh
George Clark,

87
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:09,322
who is still at MIT,
uh he was doing x-ray astronomy

88
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:12,983
from very high-flying balloons,
very close to the top of the

89
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:16,644
atmosphere, and the advantage of
balloons was that you could

90
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:20,055
observe the sky for
many many hours,

91
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:22,779
if you're lucky sometimes even
a day or more.

92
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,998
But on the other hand,
since there is always a little

93
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:29,527
bit of atmosphere left above
you, even though there's very

94
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:33,056
little, there is still some
left, the x-rays are absorbed,

95
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:36,647
almost all x-rays below twenty
kilo electron-volts would be

96
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:39,495
absorbed, and we would not be
able to see them.

97
00:05:39,495 --> 00:05:43,147
But of course the compensation
was that we could look at the

98
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:46,8
sky for many many many hours.
Nowadays no one is doing these

99
00:05:46,8 --> 00:05:51,721
balloon observations anymore.
No more rocket observations.

100
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:54,883
Everything is done of course
from satellites.

101
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:58,403
So when I came to MIT,
together with George Clark,

102
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:02,858
I developed new x-ray detectors
for these balloon observations.

103
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,444
Many graduate students were
involved.

104
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:08,965
Many undergraduates.
It would take about two years

105
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:12,413
to build a telescope.
To give you a rough idea it

106
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,58
would take a million dollars in
terms of nineteen sixty-six

107
00:06:16,58 --> 00:06:20,819
dollars, and the weight of such
a telescope

108
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,13
would be roughly a thousand
kilograms.

109
00:06:23,13 --> 00:06:26,377
The balloons in those days
would cost about a hundred

110
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:29,686
thousand dollars to get us up to
these high altitudes,

111
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:33,245
and we would need about eighty
thousand dollars of helium,

112
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:35,493
and you will see some slides of
that.

113
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:39,177
We have to go to altitudes of
about a hundred forty thousand

114
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:41,362
feet.
We had huge balloons for that.

115
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:44,172
You will see one.
They have diameters of about

116
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:46,483
six hundred feet.
And the material was

117
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,98
polyethylene.
Extremely thin to make them

118
00:06:48,98 --> 00:06:52,572
light-weight so that they can go
high.

119
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:55,454
The thickness of that
polyethylene was about half of

120
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:58,675
one-thousandth of an inch.
Which is thinner than the saran

121
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,539
wrap that you have in the
kitchen.

122
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,46
It is thinner than cigarette
paper.

123
00:07:02,46 --> 00:07:04,89
A very risky business to fly
these balloons.

124
00:07:04,89 --> 00:07:07,32
No guarantee of course that
they would work.

125
00:07:07,32 --> 00:07:09,863
You pay your money.
If they work that's great.

126
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,179
If they don't work that's just
tough luck.

127
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:15,626
There is a good chance that you
have a failure when you launch

128
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,491
the balloon.
They're very fragile.

129
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:19,808
There could be damage right at
the launch.

130
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:23,198
But even if they make it up in
the atmosphere they have to go

131
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:26,08
through
the tropopause,

132
00:07:26,08 --> 00:07:30,148
near about a hundred thousand
feet where it's very very cold,

133
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:33,471
the balloons get brittle,
and then they can burst.

134
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:37,743
And that of course would be the
end then of that balloon flight.

135
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:40,456
And that could also be the end
of a Ph.D.

136
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,965
thesis.
Because that all these flights

137
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:47,033
of course were connected with
research and therefore with Ph.

138
00:07:47,033 --> 0.

139
0. --> 00:07:49,135
in the Netherlands on nuclear
work and so the tension during

140
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,136
these early phases of the launch
were always extremely high.

141
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:57,002
Sometimes even unbearable.
So now I would like to show you

142
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:04,132
some slides.
Which will give you a good idea

143
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:09,732
of what these expeditions were
like.

144
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:19,012
Oh, yeah, a classic problem.
This is nice that these -- ah,

145
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:26,212
now they work.
All right, so if I can have the

146
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:32,369
first slide,
you see here Jim and Pat who at

147
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:37,519
the time were undergraduates,
they are now both Ph.D.s,

148
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,811
and they are working there,
very tedious work,

149
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:45,435
trying to put the electronics
together.

150
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:49,918
You may think that science is
not very romantic.

151
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:54,21
But I can assure you it is.
They fell in love.

152
00:08:54,21 --> 00:08:56,88
They married.
They have kids.

153
00:08:56,88 --> 00:09:02,508
And that's the way it sometimes
goes in life.

154
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,288
And so here you see the plant
in Texas where these huge

155
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:09,579
balloons were made.
Uh balloons are put together

156
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:13,92
sort of like the -- the way that
the tangerine is put together.

157
00:09:13,92 --> 00:09:17,351
At the surface you see these
gores of the balloon.

158
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:21,553
And the sealing of these gores
to make up the balloon were --

159
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:25,333
was only done by women.
Only women were allowed to work

160
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,574
there.
Has nothing to do with sex

161
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:31,495
discrimination of any kind.
It just turned out that women

162
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:33,973
were
more patient.

163
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:38,081
They did the work better.
They make way fewer mistakes

164
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,793
than men did.
That's the way it goes

165
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:44,591
sometimes in life.
Here you see balloon coming out

166
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:46,76
of the box.
Nicely protected.

167
00:09:46,76 --> 00:09:50,171
Plastic cover.
And we also have here cloth on

168
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:55,053
the -- on the grass because the
balloon is so thin that it would

169
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,541
certainly get damaged if it
touches the grass,

170
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:03,346
it's enormously thin.
This was not my balloon.

171
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:06,881
Uh we were worried that there
was something wrong with it.

172
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:10,54
You can see here the concern.
They thought it was a -- there

173
00:10:10,54 --> 00:10:14,013
was a hole in the balloon.
And that if there is a hole in

174
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,735
the balloon there's just nothing
you can do about it anymore.

175
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:21,394
You can't patch it because the
hole is almost always through

176
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:24,309
many many layers.
What you're looking at here is

177
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:27,658
hundreds of layers of balloon
that are folded together.

178
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:30,263
But as I said,
since it wasn't my balloon I

179
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,24
wasn't too worried,
but of course it's never nice

180
00:10:33,24 --> 00:10:36,899
if you see a failure of your
colleagues.

181
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,323
Now I bring you to the desert
town Alice Springs in uh

182
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,326
Australia.
Right at the heart of

183
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:44,845
Australia.
And now you get a pretty good

184
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:48,268
idea of what it's like.
Here you see the launch truck.

185
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:51,111
The telescope is there.
And then you see this

186
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:54,599
enormously big balloon.
All of it is empty now and most

187
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,958
of this will stay empty.
This is the roller arm which

188
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,317
holds this part down.
This is the only part that will

189
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,836
be inflated.
And here you see the helium

190
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:07,453
truck.
And here you see the inflation

191
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:09,671
tubes.
And we will let helium in from

192
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:13,243
both sides which will then
gradually begin to fill this top

193
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:16,384
part of the balloon.
And you see here the roller arm

194
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,354
in detail.
The roller arm is very

195
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:22,173
important because when this part
of the balloon is being filled

196
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:24,328
it wants to lift,
it wants to go up,

197
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:27,9
and of course you have to keep
it down, you have to keep it

198
00:11:27,9 --> 00:11:30,672
under control.
And so this roller arm and this

199
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:33,135
-- this car is loaded down with
concrete.

200
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:37,261
It's very heavy.
And then just before the launch

201
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:41,19
this roller arm by command is
fweet flipped over and then as

202
00:11:41,19 --> 00:11:44,586
you will see later then the
balloon will make it up.

203
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:47,782
And here you see the early part
of the inflation.

204
00:11:47,782 --> 00:11:49,846
Helium comes in from both
sides.

205
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:53,375
And so we -- we fly these
balloons almost always early

206
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,305
morning because then the winds
are very calm.

207
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:58,503
You need extremely reliable
winds.

208
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:01,166
You need to know the direction
very well.

209
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,095
And the winds should be uh no
more than something like three

210
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:08,624
or four miles per hour.
If they are stronger you would

211
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:11,239
lose
the balloon.

212
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:15,677
You see here these gores that I
mentioned to you earlier.

213
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:18,451
Where the sun is behind the
balloon.

214
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:21,937
Here the bubble is nearly fully
inflated now.

215
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:25,107
Here it's still going on.
Still going on,

216
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:28,435
the inflation.
But we are very close to the

217
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:32,556
end of the inflation.
Here is the roller arm and then

218
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:37,073
in this direction here five
hundred feet or so down is the

219
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:41,738
payload with the truck.
We're now very close to a

220
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:44,005
launch.
We're still in Alice Springs.

221
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:47,532
This is -- was my graduate
student Jeff McClintock at the

222
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,548
time.
He's now Doctor McClintock.

223
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:53,201
Here you see radar reflectors
which allows us to follow the

224
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:55,909
balloon -- radar.
Here you see the telescope

225
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,121
hanging on the launch truck.
Here is the roller arm.

226
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:02,207
All this is empty.
And here you see the parachute.

227
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,608
We have here a connection
between the parachute and the

228
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:08,631
bottom of the balloon.
And we can control that on

229
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:12,831
radio command.
We can separate that so that

230
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,773
the telescope safely comes back
to earth.

231
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:18,199
At least that's the idea on
paper.

232
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,435
And so now you see the release
of the bubble.

233
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:25,332
So the roller arm is up and
this bubble now takes off.

234
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:28,126
This is an incredibly fantastic
moment.

235
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:32,391
This is really butterflies in
your stomach and ants in your

236
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:35,112
pants.
This is the moment that balloon

237
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,686
can easily fail.
Very thin material,

238
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:41,991
the helium goes up,
reflects against the top,

239
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:45,222
is pushed back again,
you get this peculiar mushroom

240
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:48,137
shape, it makes an enormous
sound like a storm.

241
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:51,369
The idea now is that this
balloon will go higher and

242
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:54,22
higher in the sky.
Will pick up all this empty

243
00:13:54,22 --> 00:13:55,868
part.
This is not inflated.

244
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,353
As the balloon goes up in the
atmosphere the atmospheric

245
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:02,648
pressure will go down.
And the helium will expand and

246
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:06,007
will fill the balloon.
And the -- the trick now is for

247
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:09,428
this truck to manipulate,
to maneuver itself under what

248
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,977
we
call the bubble.

249
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:16,379
And therefore the wind has to
be in this direction so that the

250
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,564
balloon comes to the truck.
And then the truck tries to get

251
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:24,532
straight under the balloon.
And then the payload will be

252
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,78
released here.
Here you see a close-up of this

253
00:14:27,78 --> 00:14:30,233
mushroom.
You can actually see this

254
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:33,769
reflection of the helium going
up and coming back.

255
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,727
You can also see these gores
very clearly.

256
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:41,49
It's tedious work.
By these women who have to seal

257
00:14:41,49 --> 00:14:44,678
these balloons.
Enormous amount of labor goes

258
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:47,141
into it.
Amount of helium as I said

259
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,04
earlier is about eighty thousand
dollars.

260
00:14:50,04 --> 00:14:52,576
About the same price of the
balloon.

261
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:55,981
And here it goes higher.
We're in Alice Springs.

262
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:59,242
The cover is falling off.
Balloon is going up.

263
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:01,633
See the engine is already
running.

264
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:05,546
The truck cannot move yet
because if it started to move

265
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:09,241
this part of the balloon would
slide over the cloth.

266
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,154
There would be friction and
there would be holes in the

267
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:17,716
balloon.
So this truck has to wait until

268
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,128
all of this is off the ground.
Going higher.

269
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:25,811
And I'm now so close to the
balloon that I couldn't continue

270
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:28,668
my picture-taking from Alice
Springs.

271
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:32,874
So I will jump back to an
earlier flight in the United

272
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:35,731
States.
We flew these balloons in the

273
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:39,62
United States from a town called
Palestine, Texas.

274
00:15:39,62 --> 00:15:44,064
And so you will see then the
remaining part of the flight

275
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,923
from Palestine,
Texas.

276
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:50,044
So the balloon is now
completely off the ground.

277
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:53,232
See a little bit of gas,
well it's not so little,

278
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:56,685
but it looks very little
compared to the size of this

279
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:59,209
balloon.
You see the parachute here and

280
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,927
here then is the connection
which on radio command we can

281
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:05,451
separate.
So now this is a very crucial

282
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:07,775
moment.
The person in charge on this

283
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:11,959
launch truck has probably driven
the truck to get straight under

284
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,615
the balloon.
And when it's straight under

285
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:18,313
there
they will allow the payload to

286
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:20,963
go free.
The payload is attached to this

287
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,476
truck.
If the balloon is too far ahead

288
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:27,552
and the payload is released it
will pendulum into the ground.

289
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:31,764
And if you release it too early
then of course the payload will

290
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:34,142
pendulum back into the launch
truck.

291
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:37,81
Both would be a disaster.
If the pull of the balloon is

292
00:16:37,81 --> 00:16:41,479
not enough, for instance if a
hole developed during the

293
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:44,604
launch, so if the tension is not
strong enough,

294
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:49,241
you would release the payload,
it would go bang,

295
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,289
back to the ground.
So all these factors have to be

296
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:57,257
taken into account,
and then finally the person in

297
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:01,305
charge commits to a launch.
And then there it goes.

298
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:04,706
All the way empty.
Here you see the helium.

299
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:08,35
The parachute.
And you see the -- the payload.

300
00:17:08,35 --> 00:17:13,289
And here you see the balloon at
a hundred fifty thousand feet,

301
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:16,285
forty-five kilometers high in
the sky.

302
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:21,887
The helium has now expanded.
The balloon is fully inflated.

303
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,335
And you can look straight
through it.

304
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,395
It's only half of
one-thousandth of an inch of

305
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:30,319
polyethylene.
And these are huge ducts which

306
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,903
have openings of about ten
meters each.

307
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:36,575
And they are there because the
balloon cannot stand any

308
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:39,499
over-pressure.
If there is any over-pressure

309
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:43,375
the balloon would pop and so
when the balloon keeps rising

310
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,387
and rising and rising when it
reaches -- reaches its maximum

311
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:51,671
volume the helium would escape
at the bottom.

312
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:55,343
That's the idea of these ducts.
Here you see George Ricker who

313
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:58,173
was graduate student,
my graduate student at the

314
00:17:58,173 --> 00:17:59,738
time.
This is in Australia.

315
00:17:59,738 --> 00:18:02,267
He is now Doctor Ricker.
He's still at MIT.

316
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,855
He's a staff member.
And this is the kind of

317
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,444
equipment that we built,
at least partially.

318
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:11,057
And he is checking the early
results during the ascent of the

319
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,164
balloon.
The balloon will go up with

320
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:16,054
about a thousand feet a minute.
If all goes well,

321
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,101
there's no leak,
it will take about

322
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:20,509
two-and-a-half,
three hours to make it to

323
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,288
altitude.
You see me here sitting on the

324
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:26,757
plane that we used to follow the
balloon.

325
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:29,226
We fly of course at much lower
altitudes.

326
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:31,202
Five thousand,
ten thousand feet.

327
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:34,288
We stay as close to the balloon
as we possibly can.

328
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:37,622
It's not always so -- not
always easy, certainly not in

329
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,153
Australia.
And so we keep an eye on things

330
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,487
and if necessary we can
terminate the balloon flight by

331
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:46,882
giving a radio command so that
the parachute comes down.

332
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:50,401
Certainly when we get close to
the ocean of course that is

333
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:54,135
necessary if
you don't want to lose the

334
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:56,706
payload.
The data -- data come back via

335
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:59,547
radio, so we wouldn't lose the
-- the data.

336
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:02,591
You get very sick,
by the way in these planes.

337
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:06,786
If you're sitting for eight or
ten or twelve hours or longer in

338
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:10,439
these planes as I have,
I learned actually a little bit

339
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:13,956
of flying which is quite easy
with a plane like this.

340
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:16,053
Here you see a map of
Australia.

341
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:19,503
Here's Alice Springs.
Uh we fly pro-balloons weather

342
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:23,901
balloons at a hundred forty
thousand feet every

343
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,9
day to find out in what
direction the balloon would be

344
00:19:26,9 --> 00:19:28,768
drifting.
And we had all reason to

345
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,767
believe that the balloon would
drift somewhere in this

346
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,804
direction.
And we alerted these radar

347
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,898
stations.
These circles here are radar

348
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,105
stations.
Because there are no airfields

349
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:40,596
here in Australia.
And so we knew we couldn't

350
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,142
follow the balloon.
We would probably lose it.

351
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,689
And therefore we alerted these
radar stations.

352
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:48,688
They could tell us then when
the balloon was in sight.

353
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,348
And that would allow us then to
cut the balloon,

354
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:55,543
cut the payload loose and --
and make the recovery.

355
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:57,923
Instead, the balloon went
straight south.

356
00:19:57,923 --> 00:20:01,136
So the predictions by the
weather balloons were not too

357
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:03,159
accurate.
The balloon went straight

358
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,242
south.
And here there was sunset and

359
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:08,455
then we don't know too precisely
where the balloon was.

360
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:11,013
Remember this was in the
nineteen seventies.

361
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:14,345
And so we were uncertain.
But here about twenty-six hours

362
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:18,034
later when we were getting close
to Melbourne which we were not

363
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:21,187
allowed to enter the air space
here between Sydney and

364
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,46
Melbourne we cut the balloon
loose.

365
00:20:24,46 --> 00:20:27,746
That means we separate the
payload from the balloon.

366
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:31,419
The balloon is very brittle.
It's extremely cold up there.

367
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,414
The balloon then fractures and
comes down in many pieces and if

368
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:39,087
everything worked well then
parachute opens and brings the

369
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:42,889
payload safely back to earth.
And then comes the big problem

370
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:45,466
how are you going to recover the
payload.

371
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:47,464
You're in the middle of
nowhere.

372
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:50,815
This balloon came down,
this payload came down in the

373
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,941
desert.
And there are no airports.

374
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:56,192
At
least the chances are that you

375
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:59,796
are a few hundred miles away
from the nearest airport with

376
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:02,262
your payload.
So what you do then is the

377
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,728
following.
You try to find a house close

378
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:08,143
to where the payload is located.
We locate the payload.

379
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,684
We see the stuff come down.
Radio beacons on the payload.

380
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:15,288
And then you fly over that
house many many times in a very

381
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:18,007
obnoxious way.
You make a -- a lot of noise.

382
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:21,295
You fly over very low.
And so the people who -- whose

383
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:26,228
next neigh- neighbor is probably
se- seventy miles away from

384
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:28,531
them know what you're trying to
tell them.

385
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:30,609
You're trying to draw their
attention.

386
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:33,867
And they know what that means
is that they want you -- they

387
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:35,889
want you to meet them at the
airport.

388
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:38,867
Whatever airport means.
It's sometimes just a strip in

389
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:41,114
the desert.
You can't land there at night

390
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:43,192
but you can land there during
the day.

391
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:45,046
And so that's exactly what we
did.

392
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,686
We drew attention to the house
of this guy Jack.

393
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:50,607
He was -- he was a complete
nut, he was always drunk,

394
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:53,191
was a crazy guy.
And so we went to the airstrip

395
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:56,617
and we waited and indeed after
fifteen

396
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:59,135
hours he showed up with this
truck.

397
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:03,059
Uh there is no windshield here
in the -- in the truck.

398
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,725
And he used to shoot kangaroos
there.

399
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:10,019
He would go sixty miles per
hour on the desert floor and he

400
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,463
would -- he would shoot
kangaroos.

401
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:16,979
And he gave me a demonstration.
Uh he put his dog on the roof.

402
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:19,275
He would go sixty miles an
hour.

403
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:23,717
And he would slam the brakes.
And then the dog would catapult

404
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,113
through the air,
the poor dog.

405
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:31,363
And then all he would say is
oh, you can't teach an old dog

406
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:34,515
any new tricks.
And he seemed to enjoy that.

407
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:38,765
When we go after the payload
the plane, the recovery plane,

408
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,843
is in the air.
Takes off from that airstrip

409
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:44,994
and we have contact with the
recovery plane.

410
00:22:44,994 --> 00:22:49,098
They and only they can see and
know where the payload is.

411
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:52,029
From the ground of course you
can't tell.

412
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:56,133
And so they maneuver you to the
payload.

413
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:59,433
And so of course Jack's help
was invaluable.

414
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:02,733
We needed him.
That was independent from the

415
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:05,65
fact that the man was a little
strange.

416
00:23:05,65 --> 00:23:09,18
On these recoveries you
encounter many animals.

417
00:23:09,18 --> 00:23:13,018
You see a koala bear here.
In a l- eucalyptus tree.

418
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,781
Very lazy animal.
Unlike most of you.

419
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:20,079
And then when we came close to
the payload there was this

420
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,996
animal, a goanna,
six-feet tall goanna.

421
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:27,678
I'll tell you,
it scared the hell out of me.

422
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:31,492
And uh I didn't want to show
that to my graduate student who

423
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:35,177
was with me and I said to him
look you know these a- these

424
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:38,733
animals are completely harmless,
why don't you go first.

425
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:42,483
This animal was no farther than
four feet from the payload.

426
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:46,426
And so my graduate student went
first and the amazing thing is

427
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:50,176
during the ten hours that it
took us to recover the payload

428
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:53,732
and put it back on Jack's truck
this animal never moved.

429
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:57,481
It was just sitting there
completely still.

430
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:00,473
This is their way of trying not
to be noticed.

431
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,533
And so here you see the
payload.

432
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,593
This was Alice,
was Jack's wife,

433
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:07,917
this is Tom Brooks,
he came from the United States,

434
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:11,705
he was an electronic expert.
And you see here the payload.

435
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:14,63
It looks heavily damaged but it
really isn't.

436
00:24:14,63 --> 00:24:18,02
This is crash pad which
protects the payload when it

437
00:24:18,02 --> 00:24:20,546
impacts.
And an impact crash pad worked

438
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:23,537
very well, very little damage to
this payload.

439
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:27,392
And then you come back after
several days to Alice Springs.

440
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,261
Alice Springs is a hole in the
ground.

441
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,233
Nothing ever happens there.
And so obviously you make it to

442
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:38,041
the front page of the Centralian
Advocate.

443
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,602
Perfect balloon launch,
thousand watch start of space

444
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:43,999
probe.
They think of this as a space

445
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,286
probe which is fine.
Balloon professor is back in

446
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,341
Alice.
They called me there the

447
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:52,628
balloon professor.
I gave -- I gave several talks

448
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:55,984
there for high schools and for
uh the Rotary Club.

449
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:58,449
So I was a sort of a local
celebrity.

450
00:24:58,449 --> 00:25:02,285
I talked to the uh news
reporter for

451
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:06,95
several hours.
And when you read this story

452
00:25:06,95 --> 00:25:13,17
you won't believe the nonsense
but that's all a detail of

453
00:25:13,17 --> 00:25:16,725
course.
OK, that's enough for the

454
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:20,835
slides for now.
I had si- about twenty

455
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:26,611
successful s- flights.
Between nineteen sixty-six and

456
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:32,832
nineteen eighty.
Many from the United States.

457
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,405
From Canada and also from
Australia.

458
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:39,595
Where that's a s- southern
hemisphere which covers part of

459
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:43,198
the sky that we cannot see from
the United States.

460
00:25:43,198 --> 00:25:46,947
I had two free falls.
Two of my balloon burst on the

461
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:50,697
way up in the tropopause.
We were unable to separate

462
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:55,034
payload fast enough and then the
whole thing, parachute gets

463
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:57,24
entangled.
You get a free fall.

464
00:25:57,24 --> 00:26:02,681
Big hole in the ground and
that's the end of the telescope.

465
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:05,28
And it was.
Twice did I lose the telescope

466
00:26:05,28 --> 00:26:07,627
completely.
But I was lucky and I made

467
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:11,622
several interesting discoveries
during those successful flights.

468
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:14,792
We discovered very early on
five new x-ray sources.

469
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:17,836
None of them had ever been seen
with the rockets.

470
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:21,577
And several of these sources,
that was the really new thing,

471
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:24,431
were highly variable.
They changed their x-ray

472
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:26,714
intensity on a very short time
scale.

473
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:30,708
We noticed even one source went
up by a factor of three in about

474
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,61
ten
minutes.

475
00:26:32,61 --> 00:26:35,965
And that of course could not
have been discovered with

476
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:38,308
rockets.
Because the rockets were only

477
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:40,65
above the atmosphere for five
minutes.

478
00:26:40,65 --> 00:26:44,638
They would quickly scan the sky
and so there's no way they could

479
00:26:44,638 --> 00:26:48,12
discover variability on a time
scale of tens of minutes.

480
00:26:48,12 --> 00:26:50,21
But with balloons you can do
that.

481
00:26:50,21 --> 00:26:54,008
So it did pay off that we were
watching the sky sometimes for

482
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:56,73
ten, twenty hours.
Our -- my longest balloon

483
00:26:56,73 --> 00:26:59,009
flight was actually twenty-six
hours.

484
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,744
We also observed x-rays from
one source

485
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:04,906
which we named GX one plus
four.

486
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:09,09
Which stands the one plus four
stands for the position in the

487
00:27:09,09 --> 00:27:11,391
sky.
And um this showed a periodic

488
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:14,599
signal in x-rays.
About two point three minutes

489
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,598
periodicity.
At the time we had no clue what

490
00:27:17,598 --> 00:27:21,781
that meant but later of course
we understood the significance

491
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:24,292
of that.
And you will understand that

492
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:27,29
also very shortly.
How significant that was.

493
00:27:27,29 --> 00:27:29,522
So what kind of objects are
they?

494
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,381
They are very very different
from the sun.

495
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:35,923
And we now know what they
are.

496
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:39,269
These objects are binaries.
Binary stars.

497
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:44,287
One star is not unlike the sun,
it's a normal nuclear burning

498
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,797
star.
And it is in orbit with a

499
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:50,31
neutron star or in some cases a
black hole.

500
00:27:50,31 --> 00:27:54,826
They go around each other.
And if they are close enough

501
00:27:54,826 --> 00:28:00,179
together it is possible that the
matter of this star is attracted

502
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,361
by this neutron star with a
larger force than it is

503
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:07,998
attracted
by the star itself.

504
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:12,392
And if that's the case this
matter doesn't want to stay

505
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:15,24
here.
But wants to go to the neutron

506
00:28:15,24 --> 00:28:17,925
star.
Now of course the matter has

507
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:21,261
angular momentum because they
goes around.

508
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:24,678
So it cannot free fall to the
neutron star.

509
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:28,909
But it would spiral in and
slowly make its way to the

510
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:32,327
neutron star.
And we call this an accretion

511
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:36,314
disk.
And we call this the donor,

512
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,591
provides the fuel for the
transfer of mass onto the

513
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:43,841
neutron star.
And let's assume that the

514
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:48,289
neutron star has a mass capital
M and has a radius R.

515
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,652
And let's assume that we dump
some matter, little M,

516
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:57,186
onto the neutron star.
Well all of you should remember

517
00:28:57,186 --> 00:29:02,404
from eight oh one that you can
calculate very easily the speed

518
00:29:02,404 --> 00:29:06,425
with which this matter reaches
the neutron star.

519
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:10,359
The kinetic energy,
one-half MV

520
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,885
squared, must be equal to MMG
over R.

521
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:16,953
We had this equation on the
blackboard last lecture when we

522
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:20,11
discussed cosmology.
It was the same equation.

523
00:29:20,11 --> 00:29:24,109
This is the speed with which
the matter will fall onto the

524
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:26,844
neutron star.
If this is the mass of the

525
00:29:26,844 --> 00:29:30,703
neutron star and this is the
radius of the neutron star.

526
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,579
You lose the -- the mass as you
always do.

527
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:36,034
And so you can calculate this
speed.

528
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:39,892
This speed is horrendous
because the radius of a neutron

529
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:43,166
star
is so ridiculously small.

530
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:47,084
The mass of a neutron star is
very comparable to the mass of

531
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:48,678
the sun.
A little larger.

532
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:51,8
But not much larger.
But the radius is a hundred

533
00:29:51,8 --> 00:29:54,656
thousand times smaller than that
of the sun.

534
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:58,109
It's only ten kilometers.
And as a result of that the

535
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:01,895
speed with which the matter hits
the neutron star is about

536
00:30:01,895 --> 00:30:05,946
one-third of the speed of light.
When it hits the neutron star

537
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:08,603
this kinetic energy is converted
to heat.

538
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:12,388
It will heat up the surface
layers of the neutron star and

539
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:16,322
increases
the temperature to about um ten

540
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:19,625
million, a hundred million
degrees, and at such high

541
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,41
temperatures,
the star would emit almost all

542
00:30:22,41 --> 00:30:25,389
its radiation in x-rays and not
in the optical.

543
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:28,757
Our sun is relatively cold.
It's only six hundred six

544
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:31,801
thousand degrees.
And so the sun has most of its

545
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:35,687
radiation in the optical but
when the temperature becomes ten

546
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:39,12
million, a hundred million
degrees, the maximum of the

547
00:30:39,12 --> 00:30:42,099
emission is in x-rays.
To give you a little bit

548
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:45,467
respect, a little bit of
insight, for this incredible

549
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:48,641
power,
for this incredible

550
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:51,623
gravitational pull of the
neutron star,

551
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:55,625
because R is so small,
if you took a marshmallow and

552
00:30:55,625 --> 00:31:00,412
you threw a marshmallow from a
large distance onto the surface

553
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:04,021
of a neutron star,
at impact the energy that is

554
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:08,18
going to be released is
comparable to the energy of an

555
00:31:08,18 --> 00:31:12,809
atomic bomb as was thrown on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki near the

556
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:17,361
end of the Second World War.
Neutron stars have very strong

557
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:22,065
magnetic fields.
And the matter that flows from

558
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:25,136
the donor onto the neutron star
is ionized.

559
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:26,964
It's plasma.
It's charged.

560
00:31:26,964 --> 00:31:31,351
And as you remember from eight
oh two when you have a charged

561
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:35,445
particle in a magnetic field
there is the V cross B term.

562
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:38,955
The V cross B force.
And the V cross B force will

563
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:42,903
then spiral these charged
particles around the magnetic

564
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:47,071
field lines and they would end
up near the magnetic poles,

565
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:52,042
not unlike the solar wind when
it reaches the earth,

566
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:57,161
these charged particles enter
the earth atmosphere near the

567
00:31:57,161 --> 00:32:00,867
magnetic poles,
giving rise to aurora as we

568
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:04,573
discussed earlier.
And so you end up on the

569
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:10,133
neutron star with two hot spots
where this matter slams into the

570
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:13,221
neutron star.
At the magnetic poles.

571
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:18,692
And if the axis of rotation of
the neutron star is not the same

572
00:32:18,692 --> 00:32:24,163
as the -- [Audience noise] Q:
Tall male physicist.

573
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:29,991
[noise] Hi, Miss Peltier.

00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:47,131
lecture?
Ask the students.

578
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,102
I don't know.
[laughter] Q:

579
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:53,53
Very handsome and charming.
OK.

580
00:32:53,53 --> 00:32:57,529
[laughter] So are you.
[laughter] Q:

581
00:32:57,529 --> 00:27:25,486
[unintelligible]
I think you know the answer to

582
00:27:25,486 --> 00:20:53,703
that one.
Q: OK, I think we have the

583
00:20:53,703 --> 00:14:33,115
right person.
[background noise] Q:

584
00:14:33,115 --> 00:04:06,263
We have a song to sing to you.
Q: [unintelligible] [tone]

585
00:04:06,263 --> 00:00:00
Singing: When I

586
00:00:00 --> 00:33:31

587
00:33:31 --> 00:33:37,103
wisdom, times have changed.
Singing: Maxwell's equations

588
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:41,874
are too hard for me,
so please just help me,

589
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:44,315
help me.
Singing: Help.

590
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:46,645
I need somebody.
Help.

591
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:49,087
Not just anybody.
Help.

592
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:52,527
You know I need someone.
Walter.

593
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:58,63
Singing: When I was younger,
so much younger than today.

594
00:33:58,63 --> 00:34:04,844
I never needed anybody's help
in any way.

595
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:09,481
But now these days are gone,
I'm not so self-assured,

596
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:14,209
now I've found my homework's
hard, no nothing anymore.

597
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:18,044
Singing: Help me if you can I'm
failing now.

598
00:34:18,044 --> 00:34:20,72
Walter Lewin,
can't do physics,

599
00:34:20,72 --> 00:34:23,841
I don't know how.
I am on pass-fail,

600
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:27,677
don't let me down.
Singing: Won't you please

601
00:34:27,677 --> 00:34:30,62
please pass me.
When I was dumber,

602
00:34:30,62 --> 00:34:35,258
so much dumber than today,
I didn't know about Lentz,

603
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:38,402
Maxwell
or Faraday.

604
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:43,968
Singing: But now those days are
gone, I'm not so dumb no more.

605
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:48,257
Thanks to eight oh two and our
daring professor.

606
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:51,359
Help me if you can I'm failing
now.

607
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,918
Singing: Walter Lewin,
can't do physics,

608
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,206
I don't know how.
I am on pass-fail don't let me

609
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:01,944
down.
Singing: Won't you please

610
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:05,411
please pass me.
Walter Lewin thanks for

611
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:11,798
teaching eight oh two.
Now it's summer and we will all

612
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:16,228
miss you.
Singing: You've been crazy and

613
00:35:16,228 --> 00:35:22,361
we've all had a good time.
So in your praise the Muses'

614
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:26,904
voices chime.
Singing: Eight days a week.

615
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:30,198
I love you.
Eight days a week.

616
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:36,899
Is not enough to show I care.
Singing: Thanks for all you've

617
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:42,918
done, I'll pass somehow.
E and M can't get

618
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:52,86
me down, I know this now.
I'll miss pass-fail next year,

619
00:35:52,86 --> 00:35:59,367
this I vow.
Singing: Won't you please

620
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:05,151
please pass me,
pass me, pass me,

621
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:10,212
ooh.
I have tears in my eyes.

622
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:17,804
[applause] So that was very
nice.

623
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:22,121
So now you won't have any time
to fill out your evaluation

624
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:24,62
form.
So I was going to um talk to

625
00:36:24,62 --> 00:36:28,786
you about the um show you some
evidence for these binary

626
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,588
systems.
So we have these hot spots on

627
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:35,829
the neutron star and as the
neutron star rotates then and

628
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,844
the axis of rotation doesn't
coincide with the dipole,

629
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:43,631
magnetic dipole axis,
you're going to see hot spot,

630
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:47,115
hot spot, hot spot,
hot spot, and that explains

631
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:50,144
then the x-ray
pulsations.

632
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:53,12
Uh you can also see in some
cases x-ray eclipses.

633
00:36:53,12 --> 00:36:56,716
If the neutron star as seen
from the earth hides behind the

634
00:36:56,716 --> 00:37:00,621
donor star which is much bigger
then all the x-rays are absorbed

635
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,667
and so the x-rays stop
completely.

636
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:06,263
You go into an x-ray eclipse
and a few hours later you come

637
00:37:06,263 --> 00:37:10,107
out of the x-ray eclipse again.
And that's what I would like to

638
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:13,144
show you the evidence for,
which came in the early

639
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,314
seventies.
With the satellite Uhuru,

640
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:17,36
the first slide is the basic
idea.

641
00:37:17,36 --> 00:37:19,406
No, that was right,
uh John, John,

642
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:24,077
go back to that picture,
yeah, so you see here this is

643
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:26,963
of course a sketch,
this is not the real thing.

644
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:29,41
Here you see a star.
Not unlike the sun.

645
00:37:29,41 --> 00:37:31,794
And then here you see the
neutron star.

646
00:37:31,794 --> 00:37:35,245
In some cases a black hole.
And then the matter is being

647
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:38,947
sucked off this star because the
gravitational force in this

648
00:37:38,947 --> 00:37:41,959
direction is larger.
Forms the accretion disk and

649
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:45,598
ends up on the neutron star.
And the next slide is then the

650
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:48,735
discovery of the early --
convincing discovery of a

651
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,496
pulsating system.
The rotation of the neutron

652
00:37:51,496 --> 00:37:54,947
star.
This time scale here is about

653
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:58,303
one-and-a-quarter second.
And the data are here,

654
00:37:58,303 --> 00:38:01,017
this is the data,
unfortunately in this

655
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:05,231
publication this -- this very
bold line dominates almost the

656
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:09,302
data, but the idea being very
clear that the x-ray signal,

657
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:12,159
this is the strength of the
x-ray signal,

658
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,945
this is time,
one-and-a-quarter seconds,

659
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:17,659
is oscillating
one-and-a-quarter second

660
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:20,373
periods.
And that's the rotation of the

661
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:23,515
neutron star.
And the next slide shows you of

662
00:38:23,515 --> 00:38:25,86
the
same object,

663
00:38:25,86 --> 00:38:29,34
it's called Hercules X one.
You see on a very different

664
00:38:29,34 --> 00:38:32,305
time scale this is days.
You see that the x-ray

665
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:35,786
eclipses, that the x-rays
disappear completely when the

666
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:37,977
neutron star goes behind the
donor.

667
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:40,942
And the orbital period is one
point seven days.

668
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:42,94
The x-rays disappear
completely.

669
00:38:42,94 --> 00:38:45,453
And so this picture is
well-established.

670
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:49,32
It's beyond a shadow of a doubt
we do know what these objects

671
00:38:49,32 --> 00:38:51,512
are.
With no one is flying balloons

672
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:56,603
anymore I make all my reserv- o-
observations nowadays from

673
00:38:56,603 --> 00:39:00,538
satellites using European
satellites, Japanese satellites

674
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:04,612
and American observatories.
Lately we have the Rossi timing

675
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:08,405
explorer in orbit and also
Chandra which is the biggest

676
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:10,794
thing in town.
Now between nineteen

677
00:39:10,794 --> 00:39:14,166
seventy-five and nineteen
seventy-nine we were so

678
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:17,96
fortunate here at MIT that we
had our own private x-ray

679
00:39:17,96 --> 00:39:20,489
observatory.
It was called Sas three.

680
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:24,352
It was an all-MIT operation.
We uh maneuvered it from my

681
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:28,076
building, Center for Space
Research,

682
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:31,064
Building thirty-seven,
twenty-four hours a day,

683
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,533
three hundred sixty-five days
per year.

684
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:37,171
It was at that time that Josh
Grindlay and John Heise had

685
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:40,679
discovered using a Dutch
satellite believe it or not --

686
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,447
they had discovered that some of
these x-ray sources showed

687
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:47,695
sudden x-ray bursts.
The x-ray intensity would rise

688
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:50,294
in about a few seconds,
would become ten,

689
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:54,127
twenty, thirty times stronger,
and then over a time scale of

690
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:57,44
maybe a few minutes,
the x-ray intensity would peter

691
00:39:57,44 --> 00:39:59,302
out
again.

692
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:03,416
And we had this Sas three
observatory which ideally suited

693
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:06,014
to do research in these x-ray
bursts.

694
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:10,199
And we discovered within two
years eight new burst sources.

695
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,24
And I think it's fair to say
that it's largely due to our

696
00:40:14,24 --> 00:40:18,065
observational work and also to
the theoretical work by

697
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:22,394
Professor Joss who was at MIT
and still is at MIT that we now

698
00:40:22,394 --> 00:40:25,137
understand what these x-ray
bursts are.

699
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:30,682
They are huge nuclear bomb
explosions on the surface of a

700
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:34,287
neutron star.
The matter that falls onto the

701
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:37,892
neutron star is largely hydrogen
and helium.

702
00:40:37,892 --> 00:40:41,078
Because that's the matter of
this star.

703
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:45,437
And the density and the
temperature on the surface of

704
00:40:45,437 --> 00:40:50,299
the neutron star is so high that
you get nuclear reactions.

705
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:54,826
And three helium four nuclei
can fuse to carbon twelve.

706
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:59,521
And then energy is released.
And this nuclear reaction is

707
00:40:59,521 --> 00:41:03,824
very unstable,
is extremely sensitive to the

708
00:41:03,824 --> 00:41:06,414
temperature.
If the temperature goes up the

709
00:41:06,414 --> 00:41:09,373
reaction rate is higher,
more energy is released.

710
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:12,333
Temperature goes up.
When the temperature goes up

711
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:16,033
the reaction rate goes up and so
on, more energy is released.

712
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,253
And the whole thing gets out of
hand.

713
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:21,027
You get a thermonuclear runaway
as we call it.

714
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:24,604
You see a thermonuclear flash.
A gigantic bomb explosion on

715
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:28,489
the surface of the neutron star.
These bomb explosions are about

716
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:31,88
eighteen orders of magnitude
more powerful than the most

717
00:41:31,88 --> 00:41:35,754
powerful
hydrogen bombs that we can

718
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:38,81
build on earth.
So this -- this layer,

719
00:41:38,81 --> 00:41:42,94
this fresh accreted layer,
goes up in one huge bomb

720
00:41:42,94 --> 00:41:47,731
explosion and then new material
is accreted and a few hours

721
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:51,118
later you will see another bomb
explosion.

722
00:41:51,118 --> 00:41:55,496
So you can see several of these
x-rays bursts per day.

723
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:59,791
The optical counterparts of
these stars, these binary

724
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:04,417
systems, uh are very faint,
but you can see them from the

725
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:08,06
--
the ground with uh optical

726
00:42:08,06 --> 00:42:12,954
observatories from the ground.
And we had reasons to believe

727
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:17,93
at the time that simultaneously
with an x-ray burst you might

728
00:42:17,93 --> 00:42:20,668
actually observe an optical
burst.

729
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:24,815
And I'll give you the reasons
why we believed that.

730
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:29,791
You see here the neutron star
and you see the accretion disk.

731
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:35,764
And let us assume that there is
an x-ray burst going on now.

732
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:39,432
These red wiggles is uh x-rays
from the x-ray burst.

733
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:43,891
The earth is in this direction.
So these x-rays reach the earth

734
00:42:43,891 --> 00:42:46,409
first.
But there are x-rays which go

735
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:49,861
in this direction.
They are absorbed by the disk.

736
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:53,601
And then the disk heats up.
To thirty, forty thousand

737
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:56,047
degrees.
And starts to emit optical

738
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:58,708
light.
Some of that optical light will

739
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:01,01
go in the direction of the
earth.

740
00:43:01,01 --> 00:43:06,476
And so what this means now is
that there is a delay between

741
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:09,713
these x-rays,
these -- this optical light and

742
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,626
these x-rays.
Because look.

743
00:43:11,626 --> 00:43:15,598
This path length is longer to
us than this path length.

744
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:19,791
And therefore we were hoping
not only to be able to see an

745
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,734
optical flash,
which would mean the x-ray

746
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:26,853
heating of the disk with the
optical light from the disk,

747
00:43:26,853 --> 00:43:30,09
but we were al- also hoping to
see the delay.

748
00:43:30,09 --> 00:43:34,43
If you can measure the delay,
if you see a one-second delay,

749
00:43:34,43 --> 00:43:38,329
it would mean that this
geometry was

750
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:41,107
roughly one light-second from
here to here.

751
00:43:41,107 --> 00:43:44,679
And so we were very ambitious.
We organized a worldwide

752
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:47,855
campaign in the summer of
nineteen seventy-seven.

753
00:43:47,855 --> 00:43:51,758
With Sas three we were going to
observe one particular x-ray

754
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:54,404
burst source in the sky for two
weeks on.

755
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:57,314
And we were asking observers
from the ground,

756
00:43:57,314 --> 00:43:59,564
optical, radio,
infrared observers,

757
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:02,937
to keep an eye on that object
and also observe that,

758
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:05,253
all the time,
as long as they could.

759
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:07,303
Seventeen countries
contributed.

760
00:44:07,303 --> 00:44:09,685
Forty-four observatories
contributed.

761
00:44:09,685 --> 00:44:13,889
Participated.
And during these two weeks we

762
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:17,786
saw one hundred and ten x-rays
bursts from this object with Sas

763
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:20,741
three, none was -- were observed
in the optical,

764
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,689
none were observed in the
radio.

765
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:26,083
In nineteen seventy-eight we
tried it again and we were

766
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:28,598
successful.
This was a collaboration with

767
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:32,306
Joss Grindlay who was at the
time at Harvard and my graduate

768
00:44:32,306 --> 00:44:35,952
student Jeff McClintock who was
at that time already Doctor

769
00:44:35,952 --> 00:44:38,466
McClintock.
He also was at Harvard and he

770
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:42,237
still is there.
It was a smashing success.

771
00:44:42,237 --> 00:44:45,642
We made it to the cover of
Nature, which is a rather

772
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,845
prestigious uh scientific
journal.

773
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:51,918
It was covered by the New York
Times and by many newspapers in

774
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:54,655
the world.
So we were the first to be able

775
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:58,594
to detect simultaneously an
x-ray burst and an optical burst

776
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:02,266
from this binary system.
Uh the data that I want to show

777
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,137
you are not the nineteen
seventy-eight data.

778
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:09,076
But they are data from a year
later because they have better

779
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:11,345
quality.
We learned how to do it of

780
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:13,682
course.
These are the x-ray data not

781
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:18,114
from Sas three.
Because Sas three was no longer

782
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:20,274
in orbit in nineteen
seventy-nine.

783
00:45:20,274 --> 00:45:22,696
This was a Japanese satellite
Hakucho.

784
00:45:22,696 --> 00:45:26,688
And so here you see the times
in seconds, and here you see the

785
00:45:26,688 --> 00:45:30,746
x-ray intensity and you see here
the x-ray burst as we observed

786
00:45:30,746 --> 00:45:33,363
it with the Japanese observatory
Hakucho.

787
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:36,963
And here you see the optical
data which were taken by my

788
00:45:36,963 --> 00:45:39,319
friend and colleague Holger
Pedersen.

789
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,853
He used a European southern
observatory in -- in Chile.

790
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:46,715
And he observed clearly an
optical flash.

791
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:50,722
This is the intensity of the
light before the x-ray burst and

792
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:54,262
then you see an incredible
increase and then you see a

793
00:45:54,262 --> 00:45:56,533
decay.
I have plotted these so that

794
00:45:56,533 --> 00:46:00,54
they both have the same height.
That of course is artificial.

795
00:46:00,54 --> 00:46:03,279
But it makes it easier to
compare the two.

796
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:07,086
And so now comes the acid test.
If now I put one on top of

797
00:46:07,086 --> 00:46:10,826
another then you see very
clearly that as we expected all

798
00:46:10,826 --> 00:46:14,967
along that the optical signal is
indeed delayed relative to the

799
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:17,305
x-ray signal.
And you can now do the

800
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:21,161
measurement
that we hoped we could do.

801
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:25,364
You shift one curve on top of
another and if you shift it by

802
00:46:25,364 --> 00:46:29,496
about two seconds then they're
almost carbon copies of each

803
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,918
other.
And so we succeeded then for

804
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:36,122
the first time to measure the
geometry of the accretion disk

805
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:40,254
around these neutron stars.
They have radii of very roughly

806
00:46:40,254 --> 00:46:43,744
two light-seconds.
Light had to travel two seconds

807
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:46,95
more, first x-rays,
x-ray heating and then the

808
00:46:46,95 --> 00:46:49,372
optical.
Two light-seconds is about

809
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:53,505
twice the distance from the
earth to the

810
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:56,097
moon.
So these systems are amazingly

811
00:46:56,097 --> 00:47:00,394
compact, very small indeed.
Needless to say that during the

812
00:47:00,394 --> 00:47:03,95
past term I haven't been able to
do any research,

813
00:47:03,95 --> 00:47:07,431
no science at all,
eight oh two has swallowed up

814
00:47:07,431 --> 00:47:10,32
everything that I had to offer
and more.

815
00:47:10,32 --> 00:47:14,617
And I think you should feel
sorry for my graduate students.

816
00:47:14,617 --> 00:47:18,84
And I think you have all the
right to feel guilty as well.

817
00:47:18,84 --> 00:47:23,136
Uh you were on my mind all the
time and not only at MIT but

818
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:26,895
also at home,
in my living room,

819
00:47:26,895 --> 00:47:31,247
my kitchen, when I took
showers, and even very often

820
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:35,685
appeared in my dreams.
Believe me, it was hell for my

821
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:40,037
-- for my significant other,
who is in the audience,

822
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:42,939
Susan, it wasn't very nice for
her.

823
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:46,353
Frankly, my life will change
after today.

824
00:47:46,353 --> 00:47:49,169
I make myself no illusion
however.

825
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:54,546
Most of you will quickly forget
all four Maxwell's equations and

826
00:47:54,546 --> 00:47:59,751
you will forget all about
induction and about

827
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:04,882
nonconservative fields.
I hope for you though that it

828
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:10,703
will not be before next week.
But surely when you will see a

829
00:48:10,703 --> 00:48:16,524
rainbow you won't be able to
resist to check that the red is

830
00:48:16,524 --> 00:48:20,865
on the outside and the blue is
on the inside.

It is a disease for which there
is no cure.

832
00:48:25,008 --> 00:48:32,229
And if you carry your personal
polarizers with you,

833
00:48:32,229 --> 00:48:40,487
then you will want to verify
that indeed the bows are

834
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:48,427
strongly polarized,
and if you do that I'll be very

835
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:55,255
proud of you.
And I hope those will be happy

836
00:48:55,255 --> 00:49:00,178
memories.
Thank you for

837
00:49:00,178 --> 49:05
attending my lecture. [applause]
