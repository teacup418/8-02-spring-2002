2
00:00:00,27 --> 00:00:03,768
Electric fields can induce
dipoles in insulators.

3
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:07,923
Electrons and insulators are
bound to the atoms and to the

4
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:12,005
molecules, unlike conductors,
where they can freely move,

5
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:15,649
and when I apply an external
field -- for instance,

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:19,731
a field in this direction,
then even though the molecules

7
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:24,031
or the atoms may be completely
spherical, they will become a

8
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:28,113
little bit elongated in the
sense that the electrons will

9
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:33,07
spend a little bit more time
there than they used to,

10
00:00:33,07 --> 00:00:36,507
and so this part become
negatively charged and this part

11
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:39,82
becomes positively charged,
and that creates a dipole.

12
00:00:39,82 --> 00:00:43,007
I discussed that with you,
already, during the first

13
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:46,508
lecture, because there's
something quite remarkable about

14
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:49,945
this, that if you have an
insulator -- notice the pluses

15
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:53,195
and the minuses indicate neutral
atoms -- and if now,

16
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:56,696
I apply an electric field,
which comes down from the top,

17
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:59,508
then, you see a slight shift of
the electrons,

18
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:02,383
they spend a little bit more
time up than down,

19
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:05,571
and what you see now is,
you see a layer of negative

20
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:09,055
charge
being created at the top,

21
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:13,223
and a layer of positive charge
being created at the bottom.

22
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:16,744
That's the result of induction,
we call that also,

23
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,834
sometimes, polarization.
You are polarizing,

24
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:24,002
in a way, the electric charge.
Uh, substances that do this,

25
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:28,027
we call them dielectrics,
and today, we will talk quite a

26
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:31,835
bit about dielectrics.
The first part of my lecture is

27
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:34,854
on the web, uh,
if you go eight oh two web,

28
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:38,519
you will see there a document
which

29
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,484
describes, in great detail,
what I'm going to tell you

30
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:46,576
right now.
Suppose we have a plane

31
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:52,572
capacitor -- two -- planes which
I charge with certain potential,

32
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:56,975
and I have on here,
say, a charge plus sigma and

33
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:59,973
here I have a charge minus
sigma.

34
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:04,001
I'm going to call this free --
you will see,

35
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:10,841
very shortly why I call this
free -- and this is minus free.

36
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:14,774
So there's a potential
difference between the plate,

37
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:17,782
charge flows on there,
it has an area A,

38
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:22,101
and sigma free is the charge
density, how much charge per

39
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,724
unit area.
So we're going to get an

40
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:28,117
electric field,
which runs in this direction,

41
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:32,051
and I call that E free.
And the distance between the

42
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,904
plates, say, is D.
So this is a given.

43
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:39,609
I now remove the power supply
that I used to give it a certain

44
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:44,622
potential difference.
I completely take it away.

45
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:48,323
So that means that this charge
here is trapped,

46
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:52,024
can not change.
But now I move in a dielectric.

47
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:54,679
I move in one of those
substances.

48
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:58,702
And what you're going to see
here, now, at the top,

49
00:02:58,702 --> 00:03:02,242
you're going to see a
negative-induced layer,

50
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:05,379
and at the bottom,
you're going to see a

51
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:09,724
positive-induced layer.
I called it plus-sigma-induced,

52
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:12,539
and I call this
minus-sigma-induced.

53
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,643
And the only reason why I call
the

54
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:22,081
other free, is to distinguish
them from the induced  charge.

55
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:25,953
This induced charge,
which I have in green,

56
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:31,208
will produce an electric field
which is in the opposite I-

57
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,526
direction, and I call that
E-induced.

58
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:37,568
And clearly,
E free is, of course,

59
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:42,178
the surface charge density
divided by epsilon zero,

60
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:46,879
and E-induced is the induced
surface charge density,

61
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,55
divided
by epsilon zero.

62
00:03:51,55 --> 00:03:58,29
And so the net E field is the
vectorial sum of the two,

63
00:03:58,29 --> 00:04:05,53
so E net -- I gave it a vector
-- is E free plus E induced,

64
00:04:05,53 --> 00:04:11,521
vectorially added.
Since I'm interested -- I know

65
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:20,009
the direction already -- since
I'm interested in magnitudes,

66
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:24,248
therefore the strength of the
net E field is going to be the

67
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:28,127
strengths of the E fields
created by the so-called free

68
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:32,221
charge, minus the strengths of
the E fields created by the

69
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:35,454
induced charge,
minus -- because this E vector

70
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:38,614
is down, and this one is in the
up direction.

71
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:42,206
And so, if I now make the
assumption that a certain

72
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:45,941
fraction of the free charge is
induced, so I make the

73
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:50,179
assumption that sigma-induced is
some fraction B times sigma

74
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:52,944
free,
I just write,

75
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:56,588
now, and I for induced and an F
for free.

76
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,414
B is smaller than one.
If B were point one,

77
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:05,516
it means that sigma-induced
would be ten percent of sigma

78
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:10,618
free, that's the meaning of B.
So clearly, if this is the

79
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:14,808
case, then, also,
E of I must also me B times E

80
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:17,542
of F.
You can tell immediately,

81
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:21,823
they are connected.
And so now I can write down,

82
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:26,379
for E net, I can also write
down E

83
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,655
free times one minus B,
and that one minus B,

84
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:35,807
now, we call one over kappa.
I call it one over kappa,

85
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:41,638
our book calls it one over K.
But I'm so used to kappa that I

86
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:44,846
decided to still hold on to
kappa.

87
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:50,289
And that K, or that kappa,
whichever you want to call it,

88
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,496
is called the dielectric
constant.

89
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:59,911
It's a dimensionless number.
And so I can write down,

90
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:04,262
now, in general,
that E -- and I drop the word

91
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:08,227
net, now, from now on,
whenever I write E,

92
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:13,254
throughout this lecture,
it's always the net electric

93
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:18,379
field, takes both into account.
So you can write down,

94
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,536
now, that E equals the free
electric fields,

95
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:27,177
divided by kappa,
because one minus B is one over

96
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:30,562
kappa.
And so you see,

97
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:34,101
in this experiment that I did
in my head, first,

98
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:38,468
bringing charge on the plate,
certain potential difference,

99
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:42,685
removing the power supply,
shoving in the dielectric that

100
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,773
an E field will go down by a
factor kappa.

101
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,107
Kappa, for glass,
is about five.

102
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:52,475
That will be a major reduction,
I will show you that later.

103
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:56,24
If the electric field goes
down, in this particular

104
00:06:56,24 --> 00:07:01,06
experiment, it is clear that the
potential difference between the

105
00:07:01,06 --> 00:07:05,835
plates will also go down,
because the potential

106
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:10,364
difference between the plates V
is always the electric field

107
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:14,739
between the plates times D.
And so, if this one goes down,

108
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:18,04
by a factor of kappa,
if I just shove in the

109
00:07:18,04 --> 00:07:21,341
dielectric, not changing D,
then, of course,

110
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:25,256
the potential between the
plates is also going down.

111
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:29,554
None of this is so intuitive,
but I will demonstrate that

112
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:31,857
later.
The question now arises,

113
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:36,617
does Gauss' Law still hold?
And the answer is,

114
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:40,443
yes, of course,
Gauss' Law will still hold.

115
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:45,728
Gauss' Law tells me that the
closed loop -- closed surface,

116
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:49,555
I should say,
not closed loop -- the closed

117
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:55,204
surface integral of E dot D A is
one over epsilon times the sum

118
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:58,119
of all the charges inside my
box.

119
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:01,035
All the charges!
The net charges,

120
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:05,682
that must take into account
both the induced charge,

121
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:09,514
as well
as the free charge.

122
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:14,709
And so let me write down here,
net, to remind you that.

123
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,268
But Q net is,
of course, Q free plus Q

124
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:21,827
induced.
And I want to remind you that

125
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:24,906
this is minus,
and this was plus.

126
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:27,888
The free charge,
positive there,

127
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:33,371
is plus, and at that same
plate, if you have your Gaussian

128
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:39,624
surface at the top,
you have the negative charged Q

129
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,592
induced.
And so therefore,

130
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:45,843
Gauss' Law simply means that
you have to take both into

131
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:49,386
account, and so,
therefore, you can write down

132
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:53,008
one over epsilon zero,
times the sum of Q free,

133
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:57,81
but now you have to make sure
that you take the induced charge

134
00:08:57,81 --> 00:08:59,936
into account,
and therefore,

135
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:02,692
you divide the whole thing by
kappa.

136
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:07,101
Then you have automatically
taken the induced charge into

137
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:09,699
account.
So you can amend mex- uh,

138
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:14,82
Gauss' Law very easily by this
factor of kappa.

139
00:09:14,82 --> 00:09:17,662
Dielectric constant is
dimensionless,

140
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:21,136
as I mentioned already,
it is one, in vacuum,

141
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:24,609
by definition.
One atmosphere gases typically

142
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:28,715
have dielectric constant just a
hair larger than one.

143
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:32,504
We will, most of the time,
assume that it is one.

144
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:35,82
Plastic has a dielectric
constant of three,

145
00:09:35,82 --> 00:09:39,531
and glass, which is an
extremely good insulator,

146
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:42,136
has a dielectric constant of
five.

147
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:47,747
If you have an external field,
that can induce dipoles in

148
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:50,97
molecules -- but there are
substances, however,

149
00:09:50,97 --> 00:09:55,103
which themselves are already
dipoles, even in the absence of

150
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:57,275
an electric field.
If you apply,

151
00:09:57,275 --> 00:10:00,778
now, an external field,
these dipoles will start to

152
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,771
align along the electric field,
we did an experiment once,

153
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,134
with some grass seeds,
perhaps you remember that.

154
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:12,057
And as they align in the
direction of the electric field,

155
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:15,49
they will strengthen the
electric

156
00:10:15,49 --> 00:10:17,038
field.
On the other hand,

157
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:19,813
because of the temperature of
the substance,

158
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:22,587
these dipoles,
these molecules which are now

159
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:25,491
dipoles by themselves,
through chaotic motion,

160
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,395
will try to disalign,
temperature is trying to

161
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,718
disalign them.
So it is going to be a

162
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:34,267
competition, on the one hand,
between the electric field

163
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:38,074
which tries to align them and
the temperature which tries to

164
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:40,784
disalign them.
But if the electric field is

165
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:45,495
strong, you can get a
substantial amount of alignment.

166
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:48,814
Uh, permanent dipoles,
as a rule, are way stronger

167
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,676
that any dipole that you can
induce by ordinary means in a

168
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:56,063
laboratory, and so the
substances which are natural

169
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:59,315
dipoles, they have a much higher
value for kappa,

170
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:02,838
a much higher dielectric
constant that the substances

171
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:05,48
that I just discussed,
which themselves,

172
00:11:05,48 --> 00:11:08,19
do not have dipoles.
Water is an example,

173
00:11:08,19 --> 00:11:11,645
extremely good example.
The electrons spend a little

174
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:15,438
bit more time near the oxygen
than near

175
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:18,631
the hydrogen,
and water has a dielectric

176
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,497
constant of eighty.
That's enormous.

177
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:26,245
And if you go down to lower
temperature, if you take ice of

178
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:29,357
minus forty degrees,
it is even higher,

179
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:32,877
then the dielectric constant is
one hundred.

180
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:37,462
I'm now going to massage you
through four demonstrations,

181
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,836
four experiments.
One of them,

182
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:43,684
you have already seen.
And try to follow them as

183
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:48,489
closely as
you can, because if you miss

184
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:51,176
one small step,
then you miss,

185
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:54,976
perhaps, a lot.
I have two parallel plates

186
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:59,979
which a- are on this table,
as you have seen last time,

187
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:03,037
and I have, here,
a current meter,

188
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:07,393
I put it -- an A on there,
that means amp meter.

189
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,284
And the plates have a certain
separation D.

190
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:16,474
I'm going to charge this
capacitor up by connecting these

191
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:22,095
ends to a power supply,
and I'm going to connect them

192
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:25,972
to fifteen hundred volts.
I'm -- I'm already going to set

193
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:29,919
my light, because that's where
you're going to see it very

194
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,48
shortly.
I'm going to start off with a

195
00:12:32,48 --> 00:12:36,703
distance D -- so this is going
to be my experiment one -- with

196
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:40,927
a distance D of one millimeter.
And the voltage V always means

197
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,15
the voltage the -- the -- the
potential difference between the

198
00:12:45,15 --> 00:12:48,127
plates is going to be fifteen
hundred volts.

199
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:52,489
Forgive me for the two Vs,
I can't help that.

200
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:55,884
This means, here,
the potential difference,

201
00:12:55,884 --> 00:13:00,329
and this is the unit in volts.
Once I have charged them,

202
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,936
I disconnect -- this is very
important -- I disconnect the

203
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:07,764
power supply,
for which I write P S.

204
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:10,916
That's it.
So the charge is now trapped.

205
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,826
As I charge it,
as you saw last time,

206
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:18,837
you will see that the amp meter
shows a short surge of current,

207
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:24,574
because, as I put charge on the
plates, the charge has to go

208
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:28,729
from the power supply to the
plates, and you will see a short

209
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:32,953
surge of current which will make
the handle -- the hand of the

210
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:36,761
power su- of the amp meter,
as you will see on the -- on

211
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:40,361
the wall there -- go to the
right side, just briefly,

212
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,547
and then come back.
This indicates that you are

213
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:46,939
charging the plates.
Now, I'm going to open up the

214
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:50,401
gap -- so this is my initial
condition, there is no

215
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:54,421
dielectric --
and now I'm going to go D to

216
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:57,655
seven millimeters.
And this is what I did last

217
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:00,098
time.
The reason why I do it again,

218
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:03,331
because I need this for my next
demonstration.

219
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:07,426
If I make the distance seven
millimeters, then the charge,

220
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:10,66
which I call now,
Q free, but it is really the

221
00:14:10,66 --> 00:14:14,181
charge on the plates,
is not going to be -- is not

222
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:16,336
going to change,
it is trapped.

223
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:19,785
So there can be no change when
I open up the gap.

224
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:23,378
That means the amp meter will
do

225
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:28,008
nothing, you will not see any
charge flow.

226
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:33,881
The electric field E is
unchanged, because E is sigma

227
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:39,303
divided by epsilon zero.
If sig- if Q free is not

228
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:45,966
changing, sigma cannot change.
So, no change in the electric

229
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:49,581
field.
But the potential V is now

230
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:56,357
going to go up by a factor of
seven, because V equals E times

231
00:14:56,357 --> 00:14:59,728
D.
E remains constant,

232
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:04,758
D goes up, V has to go up.
And this is what I want to show

233
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:09,083
you first, even though you have
already seen this.

234
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:14,378
And I need the new conditions
for my demonstration that comes

235
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:17,996
afterwards.
I'm going from fifteen hundred

236
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:23,203
volts to about ten thousand
volts, it goes up by a factor of

237
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:26,203
seven.
And you're going to see that

238
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:30,615
there.
There you see your amp meter.

239
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:34,765
I'm going to -- you see the,
um, this is this propeller volt

240
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:38,774
meter that we discussed last
time, and here you see the --

241
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:41,517
the plates.
They're one millimeter apart

242
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:44,542
now, very close.
And I'm going to charge the

243
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:48,269
plates, I will count down,
so you keep your amp meter,

244
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,294
three, two, one,
zero, and you saw a current

245
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:53,615
surge.
So I charged the capacitor.

246
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:56,78
It is charged now.
The volt meter doesn't show

247
00:15:56,78 --> 00:16:00,297
very much, fifteen hundred
volts.

248
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:02,895
Maybe it went up a little,
but not very much,

249
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,143
but now I'm going to increase
the gap to ten -- to seven

250
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,804
millimeters, and look that the
amp meter is not doing anything,

251
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:12,875
the charge is trapped,
so there is no charge going to

252
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,768
the plates, but look what the
volt meter is doing.

253
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:19,252
It's increasing the voltage,
it's not approaching almost ten

254
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:21,614
thousand volts,
although this is not very

255
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,094
quantitative,
and now I have a gap of about

256
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:26,634
seven millimeters,
and that's what I wanted.

257
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:29,882
We've seen that the plates on
the left side here are now

258
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:33,248
farther apart than they were
before.

259
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:38,53
So that is my demonstration
number one, a repeat of what we

260
00:16:38,53 --> 00:16:41,991
did last time.
So now comes number two.

261
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:47,456
So now my initial conditions
are that V is now ten kilovolts,

262
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:52,192
so that's the potential
difference between the plates

263
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:56,473
that I have now,
and D is now seven millimeters,

264
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,388
and I'm not going to change
that.

265
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:01,938
At this moment,
kappa is one.

266
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:07,371
But now, I'm going to insert
the dielectric.

267
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:13,134
So I take a piece of glass,
and I'll just put it into that

268
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:16,166
gap.
Q free cannot go anywhere,

269
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:20,615
because I have disconnected the
power supply.

270
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:25,771
So Q free, no change.
If there is no chee- no change

271
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:30,724
in the free charge,
the amp meter will do nothing.

272
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:36,184
So as I plunge in this
dielectric, you will not see any

273
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:42,094
reading on the amp meter.
But, as we discussed at length

274
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,308
now, the electric field,
which is the net electric

275
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:47,931
field, will go down by that
factor kappa.

276
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:50,948
That's what the whole
discussion was all about.

277
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,244
That's going to be a factor of
five.

278
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:57,245
And since the potential equals
electric field times D -- but I

279
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:00,983
keep D at seven millimeters,
I'm not going to change it --

280
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:04
if E goes down by a factor
kappa, then clearly,

281
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07,214
the potential will also go down
by a factor kappa.

282
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:11,018
So now you're going to see the
second part, and that is I'm

283
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:13,704
going --
as it is now,

284
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:17,3
I'm going to plunge in this
glass, the seven millimeters

285
00:18:17,3 --> 00:18:20,896
thick, I put it in there,
you expect to see no change on

286
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:23,512
the amp meter,
but you expect the voltage

287
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:27,238
difference over the plates to go
down by a factor of five,

288
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:30,965
so you will see that -- that
the propeller volt meter will

289
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,907
have a smaller deflection.
You ready for this?

290
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:36,13
There we go.
Now you have a smaller

291
00:18:36,13 --> 00:18:39,072
potential difference,
but there was no current

292
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:42,014
flowing through the plates or
from the plates.

293
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:47,353
When I take it out again,
the potential difference comes

294
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:52,224
back to the ten thousand volts.
So that's demonstration number

295
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:54,621
two.
Now we go to number three.

296
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:59,173
But before we go to number
three, I want to ask myself the

297
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:03,885
question, what actually happened
with the capacitance when I

298
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:07,16
bring the dielectric between
those plates?

299
00:19:07,16 --> 00:19:11,153
Well, the capacitance is
defined as the free charge

300
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:16,424
divided by the potential
difference over the plates.

301
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:19,015
That's the definition of
capacitance.

302
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:22,397
And since, in this experiment,
as you have seen,

303
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:25,419
the voltage went down by a
factor of kappa,

304
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,585
the capacitance goes up by a
factor of kappa,

305
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,815
because Q free was not
changing.

306
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:34,989
And so, since the capacitance,
as we derived this last time

307
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:38,371
for plane -- plate capacitors,
I still remember,

308
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:42,76
it was the area times epsilon
zero divided by the separation D

309
00:19:42,76 --> 00:19:46,43
-- since we now know that with
the

310
00:19:46,43 --> 00:19:49,923
glass in place,
that's -- the capacitance is

311
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:54,472
higher by a factor of kappa,
this is now the amendment we

312
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:57,559
have to make.
To calculate capacitance,

313
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:02,271
we simply have to multiply,
now, by the dielectric constant

314
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:06,414
of the thin layer that separates
the two conductors,

315
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,964
the layer that has thickness D
that is in between the two

316
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:12,507
plates.
In our case,

317
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:16
I brought in glass.
I could write down a few

318
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20,627
equations
now that you can always hold on

319
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:24,195
to in your life,
and you can also use them in

320
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:26,952
the two demonstrations that
follow.

321
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:30,683
And one is that E -- which is
always the net E,

322
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:35,387
when I write E it's always the
net one -- equals sigma free

323
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:38,225
divided by epsilon zero times
kappa.

324
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:41,956
There comes that kappa that we
discussed today.

325
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,794
Let's call that equation number
one.

326
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:49,011
The second one is that the
potential

327
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:53,176
difference over the plates is
always the electric field

328
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:57,65
between the plates times D,
because the integral of E dot D

329
00:20:57,65 --> 00:21:01,583
L, over a certain pass,
is the potential difference.

330
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:06,057
That's not going to change.
And then the third one that may

331
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,913
come in handy is the one that I
have already there,

332
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:13,847
C equals Q free divided by the
potential difference,

333
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:18,32
which, in terms of the plate
area, is A times epsilon zero,

334
00:21:18,32 --> 00:21:22,25
divided by
D, times kappa.

335
00:21:22,25 --> 00:21:27,188
Let's call this equation number
three.

336
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:34,796
Now comes my third experiment.
In the third demonstration,

337
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:40,668
I am not going to disconnect my
power supply.

338
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:47,074
So now, in number three,
I start out with fifteen

339
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:54,147
hundred volts,
just like we did with number

340
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:59,57
one, but the power supply will
stay in there throughout,

341
00:21:59,57 --> 00:22:03,908
never take it off.
We start with D equals one

342
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:08,443
millimeter, just like we did in
experiment one.

343
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:11,894
No glass.
I'm going to charge it up,

344
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:16,528
just like I did with number
one, and, of course,

345
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:21,556
I will see that the amp meter
will show this charge.

346
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,415
[clk].
See a surge of current.

347
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:29,443
Now I'm going to increase D to
seven

348
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:32,875
millimeters.
Now something very different

349
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:37,337
will happen from what we saw in
the first experiment.

350
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:41,97
The reason is that the
potential difference is going to

351
00:22:41,97 --> 00:22:46,603
be fixed, because the power
supply is not disconnected,

352
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:49,263
the power supply stays in
place.

353
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:52,094
Look, now, at equation number
two.

354
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:56,813
If that V cannot change,
and if I increase D by a factor

355
00:22:56,813 --> 00:23:02,047
of seven, now the electric field
must come down by a factor of

356
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,292
seven.
And so now the electric field

357
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:10,993
will come down by that factor of
seven, because I go from one

358
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:15,458
millimeter to seven millimeters.
So now the electric field

359
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,924
changes, because D goes up.
In case you were interested in

360
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:23,371
the capacitance,
the capacitance will also go

361
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:27,601
down by a factor of seven,
because, if you look at this

362
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:31,675
equation, kappa is one.
If I make D go up by a factor

363
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:36,168
of seven, C goes down by
a factor of seven.

364
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:38,949
Just look at this,
simple as that.

365
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:42,572
So C must also go down by a
factor of seven.

366
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:45,774
Nothing to do with dielectric.
Nothing.

367
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:50,493
And so Q free must now also go
down by a factor of seven,

368
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:54,706
because if the potential
difference doesn't change,

369
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:59,509
but if Q free goes down a
factor of seven -- or by -- if C

370
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:04,733
goes down by a factor of seven,
Q free must go down by a factor

371
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:06,699
of
seven.

372
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:10,897
This goes down by a factor of
seven, this doesn't change.

373
00:24:10,897 --> 00:24:14,569
So the free charge goes down by
a factor of seven.

374
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:18,392
And what does that mean?
That means charge will flow

375
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:21,165
from the plates,
away from the plates,

376
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:25,512
and so my amp meter will now --
will tell me that charge is

377
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:29,635
flowing from the plates,
and so that handle -- that hand

378
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,333
there will go [wssshhht] to the
left.

379
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:36,08
And so, as I open up,
depending upon how fast I can

380
00:24:36,08 --> 00:24:40,044
do
that, charge will flow from the

381
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:44,895
plates, in the other direction,
it -- the charge will flow off

382
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:48,711
the plates, and that current
meter will show you,

383
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:52,21
every time that I open it a
little bit [klk],

384
00:24:52,21 --> 00:24:56,344
it will go to this direction.
So let's do that first,

385
00:24:56,344 --> 00:25:00,638
no dielectric involved,
simply keeping the power supply

386
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:03,103
connected.
So I have to go back,

387
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:08,509
first, to one millimeter,
which is what I'm doing now,

388
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:13,115
I have here this thin sheet to
make sure that I don't short

389
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:17,323
them out, it's about one
millimeter, and I am going to

390
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:21,531
now connect the fifteen hundred
volts, and keep it on,

391
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:25,422
and as I charge it,
you will see the current meter

392
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:27,407
surge to the right,
right?

393
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:30,424
That always means we charge the
plates.

394
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:32,806
So there we go,
did you see it?

395
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:36,3
I didn't see it because I had
to concentrate.

396
00:25:36,3 --> 00:25:39,589
Did it go like this?
Good.

397
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:43,032
So now it's charged.
We don't take this connection

398
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:46,827
off, it's connected with the
power supply all the time.

399
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:50,833
And now I'm going to open up,
and as I'm going to open up,

400
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:55,19
the potential remains the same,
so this volt meter doesn't give

401
00:25:55,19 --> 00:25:59,126
a damn, it will stay exactly
where it is, because fifteen

402
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,148
hundred volts remains fifteen
hundred volts,

403
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:06,224
but now, we go -- as we open
up, we're going to take charge

404
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:11,071
off the plates and so this,
I expect to go to the left.

405
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,587
Every time that I give it a
little jerk, I do it now,

406
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:16,75
it went to the left.
I go it now,

407
00:26:16,75 --> 00:26:20,469
again, I go to two millimeters,
go to three millimeters,

408
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:23,714
go to four millimeters,
make it five millimeters,

409
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,945
five millimeters,
six millimeters,

410
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:28,717
and I finally end up at seven
millimeters.

411
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:32,706
And every time that I made it
larger, you saw the hand go to

412
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:35,275
the left.
Every time I took some charge

413
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:37,641
off.
So that is demonstration number

414
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:39,467
three.
Why did I go to seven

415
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:43,551
millimeters?
You've guessed it!

416
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:47,319
Now I want to plunge in the
dielectric.

417
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:52,972
So my experiment number four,
I start with fifteen hundred

418
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:57,535
volts, I start with D equals
seven millimeters,

419
00:26:57,535 --> 00:27:00,708
and I'm not going to change
that.

420
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:06,857
There's no dielectric in place,
but now, I put a dielectric in.

421
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:12,609
So kappa goes in.
What now is going to happen?

422
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:16,039
Well, for sure,
V is unchanged,

423
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:21,068
because it's connected with the
power supply,

424
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:26,441
so that cannot change.
What happens with Q free?

425
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:32,385
Look at this equation.
W hen I put in the dielectric,

426
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:38,787
I know that the capacitance
goes up by a factor of kappa.

427
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:43,931
C will go up by a factor of
kappa.

428
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:48,324
If C goes up with a factor of
kappa, and if V is not changing,

429
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:51,421
then Q free must go up by a
factor of kappa.

430
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:54,23
Follows immediately from
equation three.

431
00:27:54,23 --> 00:27:57,039
So this must go up by a factor
of kappa.

432
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,28
What does that mean?
That the charge will flow

433
00:28:00,28 --> 00:28:03,666
through the plates.
I increase the charge on the

434
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,907
plates, and so my amp meter will
tell me that.

435
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:09,356
And so my amp meter will say,
"Aha!

436
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:14,614
I have to put charge on the
plates," and so my amp meter

437
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:19,513
will now do this.
And that's what I want to show

438
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:22,119
you.
The remarkable thing,

439
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:28,269
now, is that the electric field
E, the net electric field E,

440
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:31,814
will  not  change.
And you may say,

441
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:37,86
"But you put in a dielectric!"
Sure, I put in a dielectric.

442
00:28:37,86 --> 00:28:42,446
But I kept the potential
difference constant,

443
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:47,31
and I kept
the D constant.

444
00:28:47,31 --> 00:28:51,136
And since V is always E times
D, if I keep this at fifteen

445
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:54,156
hundred volts,
and I keep the seven millimeter

446
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:57,176
seven millimeters,
then the net electric field

447
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:59,726
cannot change,
it's exactly what it was

448
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:02,142
before.
That is the reason why Q free

449
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,222
has to change,
think about that.

450
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:07,444
Because you do introduce --
induce charges on the

451
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:11,336
dielectric, and you have to
compensate for that to keep the

452
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:14,356
E field constant,
and the only way that nature

453
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:17,98
can com- compensate for that is
to

454
00:29:17,98 --> 00:29:21,606
increase the charge on the
plates, the free charge.

455
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:24,579
And so that's what I want to
show you now,

456
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:28,422
which is the last part.
So I'm going now to put in the

457
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:32,773
dielectric, and what you will
see, then, is that current will

458
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:36,036
flow onto the plates,
so the propeller will do

459
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:39,806
nothing, will sit there,
and you will see this one go

460
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:43,722
klunk when I bring in the glass.
And then it goes back,

461
00:29:43,722 --> 00:29:46,477
of course.
There's only a little charge

462
00:29:46,477 --> 00:29:49,087
that comes off,
and

463
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,173
then it will go back.
So as I plunge it in,

464
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:55,331
you will see charge flowing
onto the plates.

465
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,682
There we go,
you're ready for it?

466
00:29:57,682 --> 00:29:59,225
Three, two, one,
zero.

467
00:29:59,225 --> 00:30:02,457
And you saw a charge flowing
onto the plates.

468
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:06,497
When I remove the glass,
of course, then the charge goes

469
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:09,582
off the plates again,
and you see that now.

470
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:12,08
I've shown you four
demonstrations.

471
00:30:12,08 --> 00:30:14,871
None of this is intuitive.
Not for you,

472
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:19,425
and not for me.
Whenever I do these things,

473
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:22,096
I have to very carefully sit
down and think,

474
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:25,201
what actually is changing and
what is not changing?

475
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:27,126
I have not gut feeling for
that.

476
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:30,045
There is not something in me
that says, "Oh yes,

477
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,032
of course that's going to
happen.

478
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:34,454
Not at all.
And I don't expect that from

479
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:36,876
you, either.
Then only advice I have for

480
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,539
you, when you're dealing with
these cases whereby dielectric

481
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,272
goes in, dielectric goes in,
plates separate,

482
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,942
plates not separate,
power supply connected,

483
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:48,923
power supply not connected,
approach it in a very

484
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:54,045
cold-blooded
way, a real classical MIT way,

485
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:58,074
very cold-blooded.
Think about what is not

486
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:03,676
changing, and then pick it up
from there, and see what the

487
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:08,589
consequences would be.
How can I build a very large

488
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:13,307
capacitor, one that has a very
large capacitance?

489
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:16,55
Well, capacitance,
C, is the area,

490
00:31:16,55 --> 00:31:19,694
times epsilon zero,
divided by D,

491
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:24,707
times kappa,
which your book calls K.

492
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:27,661
So give K -- make K large,
make A large,

493
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:30,616
and make D as small as you
possibly can.

494
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:34,783
Ah, but you have a limit for D.
If you make D too small,

495
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:39,101
you may get sparks between the
conductors, because you may

496
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:43,268
exceed the electric field,
the breakdown electric field.

497
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:47,056
So you must always stay below
that breakdown field,

498
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:51,072
which in A, it would be three
million volts per meter.

499
00:31:51,072 --> 00:31:54,557
If you  want a very large
kappa, you would say,

500
00:31:54,557 --> 00:31:59,601
"Well,
why don't you make the layer

501
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:03,16
water, in between,
that has a kappa of eighty."

502
00:32:03,16 --> 00:32:07,259
Ah, the problem is that water
has a very low breakdown

503
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,276
electric field,
so you don't want water.

504
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:14,531
If you take polyethylene --
I'll just call it poly here,

505
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:18,63
to se- as abbreviation --
polyethylene has a breakdown

506
00:32:18,63 --> 00:32:22,498
electric field of eighteen
million volts per meter,

507
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:27,217
and it has a kappa,
I believe of three.

508
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:31,742
Many capacitors are made
whereby the layer in between is

509
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:35,198
polyethylene,
although mica would be really

510
00:32:35,198 --> 00:32:37,419
superior.
Be that as it may,

511
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,134
I want to evaluate,
now, with you,

512
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:43,343
two capacitors,
which each have the same

513
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:46,47
capacitance of one hundred
microfarads.

514
00:32:46,47 --> 00:32:49,596
But one of them,
the manufacturer says,

515
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:54,204
that you could put a maximum
potential difference of four

516
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:57,495
thousand volts over it,
that's this baby.

517
00:32:57,495 --> 00:33:01,916
And the other,
I got to Radio Shack,

518
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:06,301
and it says you cannot exceed
the potential difference,

519
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:10,93
not more than forty volts.
Well, if I have polyethylene in

520
00:33:10,93 --> 00:33:15,559
between the layers of the
conductors, then I can calculate

521
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:19,863
what the thickness D should be
before I get breakdown.

522
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:22,949
That's very easy,
because V equals E D,

523
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:26,766
and so I put in here,
eighteen million volts per

524
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:31,07
meter, and I go to four thousand
volts,

525
00:33:31,07 --> 00:33:33,725
and then I see what I
unintelligible D.

526
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:36,868
And it turns out that the
minimum value for D,

527
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:40,779
you cannot go any thinner,
is then two hundred and twenty

528
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,481
microns, and so for this one,
it is only two point two

529
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,066
microns.
You can make it much thinner,

530
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,418
because the potential
difference is hundred times

531
00:33:50,418 --> 00:33:52,723
lower.
So you can make the layer a

532
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:56,565
hundred times thinner before you
get electric breakdown.

533
00:33:56,565 --> 00:34:00,337
I want the two capacitors to
have the same capacitance.

534
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:04,667
That means, since they have the
same kappa,

535
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:09,408
and they have the same epsilon
zero, it means that A over D has

536
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:12,008
to be the same for both
capacitors.

537
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,378
So A divided by D,
for this one,

538
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:17,972
must be the same as A divided
by D for that one.

539
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:22,025
But if D here is a hundred
times larger than this one,

540
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:25,466
then this A must also be
hundred times larger,

541
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:29,518
because A over D is constant.
So if A here is hundred,

542
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:34,03
then A is here one.
But now, think about it.

543
00:34:34,03 --> 00:34:36,844
What determines the volume of a
capacitor?

544
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:40,826
That's really  the area of the
plates, times the thickness.

545
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:43,915
And if I ignore,
for now, the thickness of the

546
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,21
conducting plates,
then the volume of a capacitor

547
00:34:47,21 --> 00:34:51,124
clearly is the product between
the area and the thickness,

548
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:54,213
and so it tells me,
then, that this capacitor,

549
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:57,92
which has a hundred times
larger area, is hundred times

550
00:34:57,92 --> 00:35:01,49
thicker, will have a ten
thousand times larger volume

551
00:35:01,49 --> 00:35:06,571
than this capacitor.
And this baby is four thousand

552
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:10,554
volts, hundred microfarads,
it has a length of about thirty

553
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:14,468
centimeters, ten centimeters
like this, twenty centimeters

554
00:35:14,468 --> 00:35:17,902
high, that is about ten thousand
cubic centimeters.

555
00:35:17,902 --> 00:35:21,542
Ten thousand cubic centimeters.
You go to Radio Shack,

556
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:24,495
and you buy yourself a
forty-volt capacitor,

557
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:27,654
hundred microfarads,
which will be ten thousand

558
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:31,019
times smaller in volume.
It will be only one cubic

559
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,903
centimeter.
And if I had one of them behind

560
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:37,869
my
ear, you wouldn't even notice

561
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,982
that, would you?
Could you tell me what it says

562
00:35:41,982 --> 00:35:45,022
here?
One hundred micro microfarad.

563
00:35:45,022 --> 00:35:46,9
How many volts?
Forty.

564
00:35:46,9 --> 00:35:49,135
Forty volts.
That's small.

565
00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:53,695
Compared to this one,
which can handle four thousand

566
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,556
volts.
But the capacitance is the

567
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:58,344
same.
So you see now,

568
00:35:58,344 --> 00:36:02,189
the connection with area and
with thickness,

569
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:08,132
by no means trivial.
All this has been very rough on

570
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,692
you.
I realize that.

571
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:14,29
It takes time to digest it,
that you have to go over your

572
00:36:14,29 --> 00:36:15,932
notes.
And therefore,

573
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:20,695
for the remaining time -- we
have quite some time left -- I

574
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:25,704
will try to entertain you with
something which is a little bit

575
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:28,331
easier.
A little nicer to digest.

576
00:36:28,331 --> 00:36:33,176
Professor Musschenbroek in the
Netherlands, invented -- yes,

577
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:38,184
you can say he invented the --
the capacitor.

578
00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:43,759
It was an accidental discovery.
He called them a Leyden jar,

579
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:48,577
because he worked in Leyden.
And a Leyden jar is the

580
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:51,695
following.
This is a glass bottle,

581
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:55,568
so all this is glass,
that's an insulator,

582
00:36:55,568 --> 00:37:00,67
and he has outside the
insulator, he has two conducting

583
00:37:00,67 --> 00:37:05,866
plates, so that's a beaker
outside, and there's a beaker

584
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:10,613
inside, conducting.
That's a capacitor.

585
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:14,06
Although he didn't call it a
capacitor.

586
00:37:14,06 --> 00:37:19,32
And so he charged these up,
and so you can have plus charge

587
00:37:19,32 --> 00:37:24,672
here, and minus Q on the inside,
and he did experiments with

588
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:27,937
that.
The, um, the energy stored in a

589
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:33,198
capacitor -- we discussed that
last time -- equals one-half

590
00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:38,005
times the free charge times the
potential

591
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,783
difference, if you prefer
one-half C V squared,

592
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:45,89
that's the same thing,
I have no problem with that,

593
00:37:45,89 --> 00:37:50,818
because the C is Q free divided
by V, so it's the same thing.

594
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:54,678
What I'm going to do,
I'm going to put a certain

595
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:59,441
potential difference over a
Leyden jar, I will show you the

596
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:04,04
Leyden jar that we have --
you'll see there -- and once I

597
00:38:04,04 --> 00:38:07,901
have put in -- put on some
potential difference,

598
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:13,479
put on some charge on the outer
surface and on the inner

599
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:16,93
surface -- you can see the outer
surface there,

600
00:38:16,93 --> 00:38:21,431
the inner one is harder to see,
but I will show that later to

601
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,681
you.
So here you see the glass,

602
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:27,957
and here you see the outer
conductor, and there's an inner

603
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:30,883
one, too, which you can't see
very well.

604
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:34,184
Once I have done that,
I will disassemble it.

605
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:38,009
So I first charge it up so
there is energy in there,

606
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:41,535
this much energy.
And then I will take the glass

607
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:45,286
out, I will put the,
um, the outside conductor here

608
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:49,42
,
the inside conductor here,

609
00:38:49,42 --> 00:38:51,923
I will discharge them
completely.

610
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:56,617
I will hold them in my hands,
I will touch them with my face,

611
00:38:56,617 --> 00:39:00,215
I will lick them,
I will do anything to get all

612
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:03,422
the charge off.
And then I will reassemble

613
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:06,081
them.
Well, if I get all the charge

614
00:39:06,081 --> 00:39:10,931
off, all this Q free [wssshhh]
goes away, there's no longer any

615
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:14,764
potential difference.
When I reassemble that baby,

616
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:18,049
then, clearly,
there couldn't be any energy

617
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:22,242
left.
And the best way to demonstrate

618
00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:25,64
that, then, to you,
is, to take these prongs,

619
00:39:25,64 --> 00:39:28,42
which I have here,
conducting prongs,

620
00:39:28,42 --> 00:39:32,822
and see whether I can still
draw a spark by connecting the

621
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:37,609
inner part with the outer part.
And you would not expect to see

622
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,621
anything.
So it is something that is not

623
00:39:40,621 --> 00:39:44,328
going to be too exciting.
But let's do it anyhow.

624
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:48,266
So here is this Leyden jar,
and I'm turning the wind

625
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:52,513
unintelligible to charge it up.
I'm going to remove this

626
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:59,106
connection,
remove this connection,

627
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:04,406
take this out,
take this out,

628
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:13,492
come on  -- believe me,
no charge on it any more.

629
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:17,846
This one.
It's all gone.

630
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:25,407
Believe me.
There we go.

631
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:30,662
And now let's see what happens
when I short out the outer

632
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,852
conductor with the inner
conductor.

633
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:36,198
Watch it.
That is amazing.

634
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:40,608
There shouldn't be any energy
on that capacitor.

635
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:43,517
Nothing.
And I saw a huge spark,

636
00:40:43,517 --> 00:40:47,552
not even a small one.
When I saw this first,

637
00:40:47,552 --> 00:40:51,399
and I'm not joking,
I was totally baffled.

638
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:57,596
And I was thinking about it,
and I couldn't sleep all night.

639
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:00,665
I couldn't think of any
reasonable explanation.

640
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:04,469
And so my charter for you is,
to also have a few sleepless

641
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:07,938
nights, and to try to come up,
why this is happening.

642
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:11,675
How is it possible that I first
bring charge on these two

643
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:15,145
plates, disassemble them,
totally take all the charge

644
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:18,615
off, and nevertheless,
when I reassembled them again,

645
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:22,018
there is a huge potential
difference between the two

646
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:24,953
plates, otherwise,
you wouldn't have seen the

647
00:41:24,953 --> 00:41:28,356
spark.
So give that some thought,

648
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:31,618
and later in the course,
I will make an attempt to

649
00:41:31,618 --> 00:41:33,815
explain this.
At least, that's the

650
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:37,742
explanation that I came up with,
it may not be the best one,

651
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:40,871
but it's the only one that I
could come up with.

652
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:44,732
In the remaining eight minutes,
I want to tell you the last

653
00:41:44,732 --> 00:41:47,661
secret, which I owe you,
of the van der Graf.

654
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:51,455
And that has to do with the
potential that we can achieve.

655
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:53,519
Remember the large van der
Graf?

656
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,445
We could get it up to about
three hundred thousand volts.

657
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:01,789
How do we charge a conducting
sphere?

658
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:06,9
Well, let's start off with a --
with this hollow sphere,

659
00:42:06,9 --> 00:42:12,289
which is what the con- the van
der Graf is -- and suppose I

660
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:16,748
have here a voltage supply,
with a few kilovolts.

661
00:42:16,748 --> 00:42:20
I can buy that.
And I have a sphere,

662
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24,925
and I touch with this sphere,
which an insulating rod,

663
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:30,592
I touch the output of the kilo-
the few kilovolt

664
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:35,425
supply, and I bring this -- so
there's positive charge on here,

665
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:39,088
say -- and I bring it close to
the van der Graf,

666
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:43,92
there will be an electric field
between this charged object and

667
00:42:43,92 --> 00:42:46,882
the van der Graf,
and the closer I get,

668
00:42:46,882 --> 00:42:50
the stronger that electric
field will be.

669
00:42:50 --> 00:42:54,52
And when I touch the outer
shell, then the charge will flow

670
00:42:54,52 --> 00:42:58,34
in the van der Graf.
I go back to my power supply,

671
00:42:58,34 --> 00:43:02,393
I touch again the few thousand
volts,

672
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:05,211
and I keep spooning charge on
the van der Graf.

673
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:08,704
Will I be able to get the van
der Graf up to three hundred

674
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:11,401
thousand volts?
No way, because there comes a

675
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:15,077
time that the potential of this
object -- which comes from my

676
00:43:15,077 --> 00:43:18,509
power supply -- is the same
electric potential as the van

677
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:21,696
der Graf, and then you can no
longer exchange charge.

678
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:24,882
What it comes down to is that
when you come with this

679
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,517
conductor and you approach the
van der Graf,

680
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:31,133
there will be no longer any
electric fields between the two.

681
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:35,666
So there will be no longer any
potential difference.

682
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:38,362
So you can't transfer any more
charge.

683
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:42,588
So you run very quickly into a
situation which will freeze.

684
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:45,794
You cannot get it above a few
thousand volts.

685
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:49,656
So now what do you do?
And here comes the breakthrough

686
00:43:49,656 --> 00:43:53,154
by Professor van der Graf from
MIT, who now said,

687
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:55,267
"Ah.
I don't have to bring the

688
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:58,764
charge on this way,
but I can bring the charge in

689
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:02,043
this way." So now you go to your
power supply,

690
00:44:02,043 --> 00:44:05,541
a few thousand volt,
and you bring it inside this

691
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:09,215
sphere,
where there was no electric

692
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:12,249
field to start with.
When you charge the outside,

693
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,663
there's going to be an electric
field from this object,

694
00:44:15,663 --> 00:44:19,329
and there's going to be an
electric field from this object,

695
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:21,731
the net result will be zero in
between.

696
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:23,88
There was no electric field
inside.

697
00:44:23,88 --> 00:44:27,04
If I now bring the positively
charged sphere there,

698
00:44:27,04 --> 00:44:30,643
I'm going to get E field lines
like this, problem two one,

699
00:44:30,643 --> 00:44:34,499
and so now there is a potential
difference between this object

700
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:37,28
and the sphere.
What I have done by moving it

701
00:44:37,28 --> 00:44:41,633
from here to the inside,
I have done positive work

702
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:44,211
without having realized it,
and therefore,

703
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:47,48
I have brought this potential
higher than the sphere.

704
00:44:47,48 --> 00:44:50,121
Now I touch the inside of the
van der Graf,

705
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:53,013
and now the charge will run on
the outer shell.

706
00:44:53,013 --> 00:44:55,527
And I can keep doing that.
Inside, touch.

707
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,288
Inside, touch.
Inside, touch.

708
00:44:57,288 --> 00:45:00,997
And every time I come in here,
there is no electric field in

709
00:45:00,997 --> 00:45:03,009
there.
So I can do that until I'm

710
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:06,09
green in the face.
Well, there comes a time that I

711
00:45:06,09 --> 00:45:10,931
can no longer increase the
potential of the van der Graf,

712
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:14,538
and that is when the van der
Graf goes into electric

713
00:45:14,538 --> 00:45:17,296
breakdown.
When I reach my three hundred

714
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:19,348
thousand volts,
it's all over.

715
00:45:19,348 --> 00:45:21,823
I can try to bring the
potential up,

716
00:45:21,823 --> 00:45:24,652
but it's going to lose charge
to the air.

717
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:28,048
And so that is the --
ultimately the limit of the

718
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:32,15
potential of the van der Graf.
So how does the van der Graf

719
00:45:32,15 --> 00:45:33,848
work?
Uh, we have a belt,

720
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:38,304
which is run by a motor -- here
is the van der Graf -- and right

721
00:45:38,304 --> 00:45:42,831
here, through corona discharge,
we put charge

722
00:45:42,831 --> 00:45:45,381
on the belt.
They're very sharp points,

723
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:49,274
and we get a corona discharge
at a relatively low potential

724
00:45:49,274 --> 00:45:52,697
difference, it goes on the belt,
the belt goes here,

725
00:45:52,697 --> 00:45:55,516
and right here,
there are two sharp points,

726
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:58,872
which through corona discharge
take the charge off.

727
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:00,818
On the inside,
that's the key.

728
00:46:00,818 --> 00:46:04,644
And then it goes through the
dome, and then it charges up,

729
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:07,933
up to the point that you begin
to hear the sparks,

730
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:11,759
and that you have breakdown.
And I can demonstrate that to

731
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:15,533
you.
I built my own van der Graf.

732
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:20,154
And the van der Graf that I
built to you is this paint can.

733
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:24,854
I'm going to charge that paint
can by touching it repeatedly

734
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:28,519
with a conductor,
and the conductor has a -- is

735
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,785
going to be -- yes,
I'm going to touch the

736
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:36,565
conductor with a few thousand
volt power supply every time --

737
00:46:36,565 --> 00:46:41,026
this is the power supply,
turning it on now -- and you're

738
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:44,771
going to see the potential of
the

739
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:47,72
van der Graf there.
Uh, that is a very crude

740
00:46:47,72 --> 00:46:50,806
measure for the potential on the
van der Graf,

741
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:53,206
but very crudely,
when it reads one,

742
00:46:53,206 --> 00:46:57,322
I have about ten thousand volts
-- this is the probe that I'm

743
00:46:57,322 --> 00:47:00,682
using for that -- two,
it's twenty thousand volts.

744
00:47:00,682 --> 00:47:03,7
My power supply is only a few
thousand volts.

745
00:47:03,7 --> 00:47:07,061
But that's not very good.
Well, I will first start

746
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:11,107
charging it on the outside to
demonstrate to you that I very

747
00:47:11,107 --> 00:47:16,342
quickly run into the
wall that I just described.

748
00:47:16,342 --> 00:47:20,878
That if they have the same
potential, then I can no longer

749
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:24,777
transfer a charge.
But then I'm going to change my

750
00:47:24,777 --> 00:47:29,393
tactics and then I go inside.
And then you will see that it

751
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:33,372
will go up further.
So let's first see what happens

752
00:47:33,372 --> 00:47:36,237
if I now bring charge on the
outside.

753
00:47:36,237 --> 00:47:39,579
There it goes.
It's about a thousand volts,

754
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:43,08
about two thousand volts,
two thousand volts,

755
00:47:43,08 --> 00:47:47,378
keep an eye on it,
two thousand volts,

756
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:50,83
it's heading for three thousand
volts, three thousand volts,

757
00:47:50,83 --> 00:47:53,289
three thousand volts,
three thousand volts,

758
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:55,747
three thousand volts,
not getting anywhere,

759
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,966
I'm beginning to reach the
saturation, maybe three and a

760
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:01,014
half thousand volts,
three and half,

761
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:04,35
it's slowly going to four,
let's see whether we can get it

762
00:48:04,35 --> 00:48:06,866
much higher than four,
I don't think we can.

763
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:10,437
So this is the end of the story
before Professor van der Graf.

764
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:12,543
But then came Professor van der
Graf.

765
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,884
And he said,
"Look, man, you've got to go

766
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:17,342
inside.
Now watch it.

767
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:20,692
Now I have to concentrate on
this scooping,

768
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:25,318
so I would like you to tell me
when we reach five thousand,

769
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:28,986
you just scream.
Oh, man, we already passed the

770
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:31,06
five thousand,
you dummies!

771
00:48:31,06 --> 00:48:33,931
Ten thousand,
scream when you see ten

772
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:35,765
thousand.
[crowd roars].

773
00:48:35,765 --> 00:48:38,636
Scream when you see fifteen
thousand.

774
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:41,507
Scream when you see fifteen
thousand.

775
00:48:41,507 --> 00:48:44,936
[crowd roars].
Very good, keep an eye on it,

776
00:48:44,936 --> 00:48:49,402
tell me when you see twenty
thousand.

777
00:48:49,402 --> 00:48:57,653
[noise] I don't hear anything!
[crowd roars] Now I want you

778
00:48:57,653 --> 00:49:05,761
tell me every one thousand,
because I think we're going to

779
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:11,735
run into the wall very quickly.
Twenty one?

780
00:49:11,735 --> 00:49:17,425
I want to hear twenty two.
[crowd roars].

781
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:24,354
Already at twenty three.
So I expect that very s- very

782
00:49:24,354 --> 00:49:29,132
quickly now -- [crowd roars] --
the can will go into discharge,

783
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,831
you won't see that,
but you get corona discharge,

784
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:37,224
and then, no matter how hard I
work, I will not be able to

785
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,615
bring the potential up.
But let's keep going.

786
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:43,466
Are we already at twenty five
hundred?

787
00:49:43,466 --> 00:49:47,242
Twenty five thousand,
sorry, twenty five thousand?

788
00:49:47,242 --> 00:49:50,556
Twenty five thousand volts.
Twenty five six.

789
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:52,56
Twenty seven.
Twenty seven.

790
00:49:52,56 --> 00:49:56,027
Twenty eight.
Twenty eight.

791
00:49:56,027 --> 00:50:01,188
It looks like we are beginning
to get into the corona

792
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:03,471
discharge.
Twenty eight!

793
00:50:03,471 --> 00:50:06,845
Boy, twenty eight!
That's a record.

794
00:50:06,845 --> 00:50:09,922
Twenty-eight,
keep an eye on it.

795
00:50:09,922 --> 00:50:12,304
Twenty nine?
Twenty nine?

796
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:15,778
Whew.
You realize I'm doing all this

797
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:18,656
work.
Well, I get paid for it,

798
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:22,129
I -- I think I've reached the
limit.

799
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:27,886
I've reached my own limit and
I've reached the limit of the

800
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:33,426
charging.
Now, we have thirty thousand

801
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:38,948
volts, and we started off with
only a few thousand volts.

802
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:43,386
Originally, it wasn't a very
dangerous object.

803
00:50:43,386 --> 00:50:47,429
But now, thirty thousand volts
-- shall I?

804
00:50:47,429 --> 50:52
OK, see you next week.
