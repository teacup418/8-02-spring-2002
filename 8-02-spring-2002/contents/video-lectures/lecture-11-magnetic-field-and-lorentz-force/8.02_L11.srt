1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,564



2
00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:05,081
So far, we have only discussed
in this course,

3
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:07,29
electricity.
Calm down.

4
00:00:07,29 --> 00:00:12,309
But this course is about
electricity and magnetism.

5
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:16,324
Today, I'm going to talk about
magnetism.

6
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:21,745
In the fifth century B.
., the Greeks already knew that

7
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:26,363
there are some rocks that
attract bits of iron.

8
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:31,082
And they are very plentiful in
the

9
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:35,26
district of Magnesia,
and so that's where the name

10
00:00:35,26 --> 00:00:38,245
"magnet" and "magnetism" comes
from.

11
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:42,339
The rocks contain iron oxide,
which we will call,

12
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:45,238
uh, magnetite.
In eleven hundred A.

13
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,758
., the Chinese used these
needles of magnetite to make

14
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:55,131
compasses, and in the thirteenth
century, it was discovered that

15
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:59,225
magnetites have two places of
maximum attraction,

16
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,233
which we call poles.
So if you take one piece of

17
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:07,429
magnetite,
it always has two poles.

18
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:10,426
Let's call one pole A,
and the other B.

19
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:14,37
A and A repel each other,
B and B repel each other,

20
00:01:14,37 --> 00:01:18,866
but A and B attract each other.
There is a huge difference

21
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,469
between electricity and
magnetism.

22
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:25,097
With electricity,
you also have two polarities,

23
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:28,962
but you are free to choose a
plus or a minus pole.

24
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:32,275
With magnetism,
you don't have that choice.

25
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:35,036
The poles will always come in
pairs.

26
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:39,454
Isolated magnetic poles
do not exist -- or,

27
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:42,573
as a physicist would say,
magnetic monopoles do not

28
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:45,753
exist, as far as we know.
If anyone finds a magnetic

29
00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:49,62
monopole -- and don't think that
people are not looking -- that

30
00:01:49,62 --> 00:01:51,99
would certainly be worth a Nobel
Prize.

31
00:01:51,99 --> 00:01:53,861
In principle,
they could exist,

32
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:56,293
but as far as we know,
they don't exist,

33
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:59,66
they have never been seen.
Electric monopoles do exist.

34
00:01:59,66 --> 00:02:03,091
If you have a plus charge,
that's an  electric monopole.

35
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,585
You have a minus charge,
electric charge,

36
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:11,372
that is an electric monopole.
If you have a plus and a minus

37
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:14,813
of equal strength,
that is an electric dipole.

38
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:18,866
Whenever you have a magnet,
you always have a magnetic

39
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:21,466
dipole.
There is no such thing as a

40
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:24,754
magnetic monopole.
In the sixteenth century,

41
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:29,19
Gilbert discovered that the
Earth is really a giant magnet,

42
00:02:29,19 --> 00:02:32,707
and he experimented with
compasses, and he was,

43
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:35,766
effectively,
the first per- person to map

44
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:40,508
out the elec- the magnetic field
of the Earth.

45
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:44,6
And if you take one of those
magnetite needles,

46
00:02:44,6 --> 00:02:48,514
and the needle is pointing in
this direction,

47
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:52,162
which is the direction of
Northern Canada,

48
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:56,699
then, by convention,
we call this side of the needle

49
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,859
plus -- uh, not plus -- north,
and we call this side of the

50
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,528
needle south.
Since A repels A,

51
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:08,62
and B repels B,
but A and B attract each other,

52
00:03:08,62 --> 00:03:14,788
in north Canada is the magnetic
South Pole of the Earth,

53
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:18,594
not the magnetic North Pole.
That's a detail,

54
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:22,14
now, of course.
So this is the way that we

55
00:03:22,14 --> 00:03:25,34
define the direction,
north and south,

56
00:03:25,34 --> 00:03:30,27
of these magnetite needles.
A crucial discover was made in

57
00:03:30,27 --> 00:03:34,508
eighteen nineteen by the Danish
physicist Oersted.

58
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:39,093
And he discovered that a
magnetic needle responds to a

59
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:44,542
current in a wire.
And this linked magnetism with

60
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:47,188
electricity.
And this is arguably,

61
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:51,038
perhaps, the most important
experiment ever done.

62
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:55,53
Oersted concluded that the
current in the wire produces a

63
00:03:55,53 --> 00:03:58,979
magnetic field,
and that the magnetic needle

64
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,551
moves in response to that
magnetic field which is produced

65
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,92
by the wire.
And this magnificent discovery

66
00:04:06,92 --> 00:04:11,652
caused an explosion of activity
in the nineteenth century --

67
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:15,582
notably by Ampere,
by Faraday, and by Henry -- and

68
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:20,555
it culminated
into the brilliant work of the

69
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:25,518
Scottish theoretician Maxwell.
Maxwell composed a Universal

70
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:29,283
Field Theory,
which connects electricity with

71
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:32,449
magnetism.
And that is at the heart of

72
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:35,187
this course.
Maxwell's equations.

73
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:38,524
You will see them,
all fear -- all four,

74
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:42,46
by the end of this course.
If I have a current,

75
00:04:42,46 --> 00:04:48,963
a wire, let's say the wire is
perpendicular to the blackboard,

76
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:53,005
and the current goes into the
blackboard, I put a cross in

77
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:55,629
there.
If the current comes out of the

78
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,529
blackboard, I put a dot there.
And there is a historical

79
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:02,507
reason for that.
You're always talked about

80
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,982
vectors, in eighteen oh one,
and in other courses,

81
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:10,095
but you're never seen a vector.
And I'm going to show you a

82
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,797
vector.
This is a vector.

83
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:14,138
And this is where it comes to
you.

84
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:18,109
That's when you see a dot.
And this is where it goes away

85
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:23,161
from you.
That's when you see a cross.

86
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:27,541
So this current,
when it's going into the

87
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:33,126
blackboard, I can put these
magnetite needles in its

88
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:37,069
vicinity, and they will then do
this.

89
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:41,887
And when I put it here,
it will go like this.

90
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:48,348
And they follow the tangents of
a circle, and this it eh way

91
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,822
that we define
magnetic fields,

92
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:56,787
and the direction of the
magnetic field,

93
00:05:56,787 --> 00:06:03,192
namely, that the magnetic field
-- for which we always write the

94
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:09,495
symbol B, magnetic fields -- is
now in the clockwise direction.

95
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:13,053
By convention,
current goes into the

96
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:17,119
blackboard.
And, if you ever forget that,

97
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:23,117
use what we call the right-hand
corkscrew rule.

98
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:27,374
If you take a corkscrew,
and you turn it clockwise,

99
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:30,013
the corkscrew goes in the
board.

100
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:33,077
That connects the B with the
current.

101
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:38,015
IF you take a corkscrew and you
rotate it counterclockwise,

102
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:43,037
then the corkscrew would come
to you, comes out of the cork.

103
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:47,634
And that's how you find the
magnetic field going around

104
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:50,783
current wires.
It's just a convention.

105
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:54,87
I want to show you how a
magnetic

106
00:06:54,87 --> 00:06:59,468
needle responds to a current.
I have here a wire through

107
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:03,732
which I'm going to run a
fabulous amount of current,

108
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:08,749
something like three hundred
amperes, and you're going to see

109
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:13,013
that wire there -- I'm going to
get my lights right,

110
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:17,36
see how I want it to go,
this is the way I want it to

111
00:07:17,36 --> 00:07:22,544
go, get you optimum light there.
When I draw a current -- here,

112
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:28,194
you see the  the magnetite,
the -- we call it a compass,

113
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:31,942
nowadays -- and it's lined up
in the direction of the magnetic

114
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:34,645
fields of the Earth.
We're going to run three

115
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,779
hundred amperes through here,
and it will change the

116
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,342
direction, it will change the
direction which is -- there's

117
00:07:41,342 --> 00:07:44,046
going to be a magnetic field
around the wire,

118
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,135
like this.
So it will go like this.

119
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:49,76
The current that I run is so
high that things begin to smell

120
00:07:49,76 --> 00:07:52,955
and smoke within seconds.
The battery is not going to

121
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:55,351
like it when I draw such a high
current.

122
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:58,668
I can, therefore,
only do it for a

123
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:01,843
few seconds.
So this compass will swing in

124
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:05,094
this direction,
and it starts to oscillate,

125
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:08,888
I can't keep the current so
long that it stops the

126
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,83
oscillation.
So I will stop it by hand,

127
00:08:11,83 --> 00:08:16,475
and convince you that that's
really the equilibrium position.

128
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,959
So if you're ready for that --
so we get, now,

129
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,21
connection, watch it three,
two, one, zero.

130
00:08:23,21 --> 00:08:26,694
There it goes.
Now I'll stop it -- the current

131
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:30,945
is still going.
You see, that's the -- that is

132
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:34,078
the equilibrium position.
And I will stop the current.

133
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,034
And now I will reverse the
current, in the opposite

134
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:40,108
direction, now you will see that
it swings backwards.

135
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:42,827
It -- hundred and eighty
degrees in a different

136
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:44,364
direction.
Three, two, one,

137
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:45,487
zero.
There it goes,

138
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,674
I will stop it,
[sniffs], few seconds,

139
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:50,689
that's the equilibrium
position, and I'll let it go.

140
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:53,467
So you've seen that,
indeed, the magnetic needle

141
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:57,073
responded to the magnetic field
that was produced by the wire,

142
00:08:57,073 --> 00:09:02,423
this was the great discovery by
Oersted, the discovery -- this

143
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:04,491
demonstration,
all by itself,

144
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:08,48
may not be very spectacular for
you, but, historically,

145
00:09:08,48 --> 00:09:11,656
it is of enormous importance.
I would argue,

146
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:14,685
perhaps, the most important
demonstration,

147
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:18,231
the most important research
ever done in physics,

148
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:21,629
because it connects electricity
with magnetism.

149
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:26,061
It was the foundation of the
creation of the whole concept of

150
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,09
a field theory.
Actually, [unintelligible]

151
00:09:29,09 --> 00:09:33,321
reaction,
and that means that if a wire

152
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:37,1
that runs a current has a force
on a magnet, then,

153
00:09:37,1 --> 00:09:41,496
of course, the magnet must also
exert a force on the wire.

154
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:44,966
And I'm going to demonstrate
that to you, too,

155
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:48,128
but now, I have a much more
potent magnet,

156
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:52,678
fro which I will use this one,
and the magnet will not move,

157
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:57,229
it's so heavy that it can't
move -- so now you will only see

158
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:02,318
the wire  move.
And the basic idea is then as

159
00:10:02,318 --> 0.
follows, here is that magnet.

160
0. --> 00:10:04,875
Oh, I turned it off instead of

161
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,817
This is the north pole of the
magnet, and this is the south

162
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:14,93
pole -- I don't remember which
is which, to be frank with you

163
00:10:14,93 --> 00:10:19,106
-- so the magnetic field would
run, then, like so,

164
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:21,833
and I have, here,
a current wire,

165
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:26,178
a wire that runs a current
through it -- the wire is

166
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:33,336
perpendicular to the blackboard.
If, when I turn the current on,

167
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:37,995
if the current is coming out of
the blackboard -- and I have

168
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:42,101
fifty percent chance,
because I really don't remember

169
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:46,997
whether this is north or south
-- but let's assume that this is

170
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:50,787
the configuration,
that the current is coming out

171
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:54,34
of the blackboard,
then you will see this wire

172
00:10:54,34 --> 00:10:58,288
experience a force up.
It is an experimental effect

173
00:10:58,288 --> 00:11:02,868
that the force  on the wire is
always in the direction of I

174
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:07,131
cross B.
These are unit vectors.

175
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:10,855
And since I is coming out of
the blackboard,

176
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:14,406
if I cross I with B,
I get a force in this

177
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:17,004
direction.
And so if I reverse,

178
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:21,94
now, the current -- if the
current goes like this -- then,

179
00:11:21,94 --> 00:11:25,058
of course, the wire wants to go
down.

180
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:29,908
And I will show you both.
But I don't know which one will

181
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:33,631
come first, because I didn't
mark the poles.

182
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:35,796
Ahh -- uhh.
So you see it,

183
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:40,559
now, slightly different from
the way I

184
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,585
have drawn it.
I've drawn you the magnet

185
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,455
looking this way,
but it's, of course,

186
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,326
much nicer fro you to see it
this way.

187
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:52,739
So you see the wire,
and there is the magnet,

188
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:57,238
and now I'm going to run a few
hundred amperes through that

189
00:11:57,238 --> 00:12:01,815
wire, and then it either will
jump up, or it will jump down,

190
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:06,237
and then I will reverse the
current, and then the opposite

191
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:07,866
thing will happen.
OK.

192
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:10,504
We ready for this?
Three, two, one,

193
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:14,578
zero.
Notice, there was a distinct

194
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:19,082
force down, the force was so
high that it even pulled down

195
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:22,48
the supports.
So now I can predict that if I

196
00:12:22,48 --> 00:12:27,063
reverse the current from this
experiment, that now the wire

197
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:30,066
will jump up.
Here we go -- I know now,

198
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:34,807
exactly, because I switched it
this way, so now I will switch

199
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:37,81
it this way, and the wire will
jump up.

200
00:12:37,81 --> 00:12:40,339
That's the first drawing you
see.

201
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:41,998
Three, two, one,
zero.

202
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:46,537
Very clear.
You saw it come out.

203
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:49,346
OK.
Let me take this down.

204
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:52,716
All right.
If I have a  a wire,

205
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:59,346
through which I run a current
-- let's say I run a current I

206
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:05,862
one  through this wire -- it
will produce a magnetic field,

207
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:11,705
right-hand corkscrew,
right here, that magnetic field

208
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:19,949
will be in the blackboard
-- I'll call it B one -- right

209
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:23,132
here, it will be out of the
blackboard.

210
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:25,729
But that's irrelevant right
now.

211
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:28,326
But it is out of the
blackboard.

212
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:33,268
Here, it's in the blackboard.
And here, I have another wire,

213
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:35,949
I'm going to run a current I
two.

214
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,216
There will be a force now,
on this wire,

215
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:42,818
in the direction I cross B.
Take your hands,

216
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:45,666
I cross B [krrk],
that force is up.

217
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:50,524
So this wire will experience a
force up.

218
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:53,764
But of course,
if this wire experiences a

219
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:57,327
force up, since action equals
minus reaction,

220
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:00,405
this wire will experience a
force down.

221
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:03,158
So they will go towards each
other.

222
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:06,074
They will be attracted by each
other.

223
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:10,852
You can in an independent way
confirm that the force here is

224
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:13,12
down.
That this is the force.

225
00:14:13,12 --> 00:14:17,331
For me, it would be enough to
say action equals minus

226
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:23,035
reaction, Newton's Third Law.
But if you want to put in here,

227
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:26,354
the magnetic field B two,
which is the result of this

228
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,843
current, which is,
of course, out of the

229
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:32,29
blackboard -- remember the
right-hand corkscrew rule --

230
00:14:32,29 --> 00:14:35,098
then you will see that this
force, now, here,

231
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:38,481
must be in the direction of I
one, crossed with B two.

232
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:40,97
And that's down,
which is exactly what I

233
00:14:40,97 --> 00:14:43,14
predicted.
So the two wires will go

234
00:14:43,14 --> 00:14:46,267
towards each other.
However, if I leave everything

235
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:50,033
the same, but I reverse the
direction of I two -- so now the

236
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:53,927
two currents are in opposite
direction --

237
00:14:53,927 --> 00:15:00,642
then the forces will flip over,
and so now the two wires repel

238
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:05,155
each other.
And I will demonstrate that to

239
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,678
you.
I have those two wires here,

240
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:13,192
and you will see them there on
the screen.

241
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:18,916
I will explain what you're
looking at in some detail.

242
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:24,2
The two wires run vertically --
this is one wire,

243
00:15:24,2 --> 00:15:30,848
and this is the
other wire -- and when I run a

244
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:37,622
current in the same direction,
then they will attract each

245
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:41,9
other.
And you will see that shortly.

246
00:15:41,9 --> 00:15:44,396
Three, two, one,
zero.

247
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:48,08
See?
They go towards each other.

248
00:15:48,08 --> 00:15:50,813
I will do it again,
now.

249
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:57,469
If I run the current in
opposite directions,

250
00:15:57,469 --> 00:16:01,774
they will repel each other.
Now I run them in opposite

251
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,455
directions.
They repel each other.

252
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:07,136
I'll do it again,
three, two, one,

253
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:09,33
zero.
They repel each other.

254
00:16:09,33 --> 00:16:13,392
The reason why I showed you
this demonstration is a

255
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:16,885
different one.
What I want you to appreciate

256
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:21,597
that if I  have this conducting
plate of aluminum -- it's a

257
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:27,121
conductor -- and I put that in
between the two

258
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:30,421
wires, and I repeat the
experiment, that exactly the

259
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,397
same thing will happen.
And that tells you that

260
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:37,473
magnetic fields are really very
difference from electric fields,

261
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:40,902
because electric fields would
be heavily affected by a

262
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:44,201
conducting sheet like this.
Magnetic fields are not.

263
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:48,083
So what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to put this plate in

264
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,641
between, and then I'm going to
again put the currents in

265
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:54,746
opposite directions,
and so we will see the wires

266
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,787
repel each other as if the plate
were not there.

267
00:16:57,787 --> 00:17:00,682
Three, two, one,
zero.

268
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:06,101
There you go.
So magnetic fields have a very

269
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:12,403
interesting story to tell.
However, electricity and

270
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:19,083
magnetism are connected.
How do we define the strength

271
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:23,747
of a magnetic field?
With electricity,

272
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:31,183
we defined the strengths of
electric fields in the following

273
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:35,28
way --
we measured the force,

274
00:17:35,28 --> 00:17:37,856
the electric force,
on a charge,

275
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:42,178
on an electric charge,
and then the electric force is

276
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:45,087
the charge times the electric
field.

277
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:49,243
That determines the strength of
the electric field.

278
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:52,9
Wouldn't it be nice if we could
now say, "OK,

279
00:17:52,9 --> 00:17:57,055
the magnetic force is a
magnetic charge times the B

280
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,964
field.
So that would then define the

281
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:03,621
magnitude of the B field.
That would be nice.

282
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:08,297
But as long as
we haven't found a magnetic

283
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:12,181
monopole, we can't do it.
If you come with a magnetic

284
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:14,57
monopole tomorrow,
I can do this.

285
00:18:14,57 --> 00:18:18,529
But we have no magnetic
monopoles, and so it cannot be

286
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:21,516
done this way.
How is magnetic field then

287
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:24,055
defined?
Well, it is defined in the

288
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:27,043
following way.
I take an electric charge,

289
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:31,225
and the electric charge is Q.
And if that electric charge

290
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:35,183
moves with a velocity V,
and there is a magnetic field

291
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:40,038
where the electric charge is
moving, then it is

292
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,467
an experimental fact that the
force  is always perpendicular

293
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,869
to V.
If you want to call that B,

294
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,797
with a magnetic indication,
that's fine.

295
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:54,226
So there is a magnetic field,
the charge is moving with this

296
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:58,73
velocity, and there is a force
on that charge which is always

297
00:18:58,73 --> 00:19:02,408
perpendicular to V.
The magnitude of that force is

298
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:06,612
proportional to the speed of the
particle, and it is also

299
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,09
proportional to the charge
itself.

300
00:19:09,09 --> 00:19:13,294
If I double the charge,
then the

301
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:16,588
force doubles.
If I double the speed,

302
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:21,438
then the force doubles.
And so the way that we define,

303
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:25,19
now, magnetic field strength,
is this way.

304
00:19:25,19 --> 00:19:30,314
The force -- and I give it a B
to remind you -- magnetic,

305
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:35,165
is Q, is the electric charge,
V is the velocity of the

306
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:38,916
electric charge,
the cross-product with B.

307
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:43,401
And you see that the force is
always

308
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,465
perpendicular to V,
and that it is linearly

309
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:50,696
proportional with the speed,
and linearly proportional with

310
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:53,688
the charge Q.
And this is often called the

311
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:56,46
Lorenz force after the Dutch
physicist.

312
00:19:56,46 --> 00:19:59,525
This equation is completely
sign-sensitive.

313
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:03,683
If you change from a positive
charge to a negative charge,

314
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:07,404
then the force flips over,
a hundred eighty degrees.

315
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:10,833
You change the direction of V,
force flips over.

316
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:15,334
Change the direction of B,
force flips over.

317
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:18,863
So it's a completely
sign-sensitive equation.

318
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:23,114
The unit for magnetic field
strength follows from this

319
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:26,402
equation, this is Newton's,
Q is Coulombs,

320
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:30,894
and V is meters per second.
So this would be the unit for

321
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:35,305
magnetic field strength,
but no one would ever say that.

322
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:40,358
In SI units -- this would be SI
units -- we call that one Tesla,

323
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:44,127
for which we write one capital
T.

324
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:47,905
A Tesla is an extremely strong
magnetic field.

325
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:52,605
The magnetic field of this
magnet is only two-tenths of a

326
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:55,123
Tesla.
And that's a very strong

327
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,802
magnet.
We often use,

328
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:59,908
therefore, a unit,
which is the gauss,

329
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:04,272
which is not an SI unit,
but you will see it often in

330
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:08,805
books, and one t- gauss is ten
to the minus four Tesla.

331
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:13,002
The Earth's magnetic field is
roughly half a gauss.

332
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:18,107
And so this magnet is about two
kilogauss.

333
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:23,918
But the SI unit is Tesla.
If you look at a  television,

334
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:29,621
or the screen of your
computer, you have a fluorescent

335
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:35,863
screen -- and in a television,
there are electron guns that

336
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:41,566
raster scan this fluorescent
screen -- on a television

337
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:49,853
screen, you have five hundred
and twenty five lines,

338
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:54,086
and the electron guns scan that
it one-thirtieth of a second.

339
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:57,966
And the intensity changes of
these electron beams create

340
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:00,648
images.
So if you look at the tube from

341
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:04,599
the side, then there are
electrons -- one moment in time,

342
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:07,35
they may move like this,
another moment,

343
00:22:07,35 --> 00:22:10,526
they may be here,
in the raster scan -- and so

344
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:14,9
it's clear that if you bring a
strong magnet in the vicinity of

345
00:22:14,9 --> 00:22:18,287
your television screen,
that you will distort the

346
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:22,606
image,
because you are now affecting

347
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:27,07
the motion of these currents,
of these electrons.

348
00:22:27,07 --> 00:22:32,277
And there is a very famous
artist, Nam June Paik who used

349
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:36,555
this for his art,
and almost every major museum

350
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:42,413
in this world has a work by Nam
June Paik, with distorted images

351
00:22:42,413 --> 00:22:46,319
using magnets and using
television screens.

352
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,433
I don't want to compete with
Nam June Paik,

353
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:55,714
but I do want to show this to
you.

354
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:59,476
I have there,
television sets,

355
00:22:59,476 --> 00:23:05,832
and I have a very strong
magnet, and I will try to

356
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:14,003
distort that image and give you
the best lights that we know how

357
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:18,284
to.
And I suggest we try to find a

358
00:23:18,284 --> 00:23:24,51
program that we hate.
So here is my magnet -- oh,

359
00:23:24,51 --> 00:23:29,828
man -- this is an extremely
strong magnet,

360
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:36,055
and let's turn on the
television,

361
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:46,808
and let's see what we can get
first.

362
00:23:46,808 --> 0.

363
0. --> 00:23:56,333
Oh, I turned it off instead of

364
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:08,316
on.
Ah, I hate commercials.

365
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:23,538
Now, watch it closely.
Here comes my magnet,

366
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:40,531
there's the image.
[background] You see that?

367
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:44,772
that [background] so you've
seen that we can,

368
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:50,169
with a magnet and a moving
charge, that we can change the

369
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:55,856
direction of the moving charge.
Force on the moving charges.

370
00:24:55,856 --> 00:25:01,349
If you have an electric field
as well as a magnetic field,

371
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:05,397
then, of course,
you have also the electric

372
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:08,578
force.
And so the total force on a

373
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:13,589
moving charged particle would
then be Q

374
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:17,54
times the electric field
vector, plus V cross B.

375
00:25:17,54 --> 00:25:20,735
And this, of course,
we've seen before.

376
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:24,181
An electric field can do work
on a charge.

377
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:27,208
Remember, Q delta V.
Can be positive,

378
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,15
can be negative,
but it can do work.

379
00:25:30,15 --> 00:25:34,017
It can change the kinetic
energy of the charge.

380
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:38,388
Magnetic fields can never do
work on a moving charge.

381
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:43,264
And the reason is that the
force is always perpendicular to

382
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:45,831
the velocity
V.

383
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:49,533
And so if the force is always
perpendicular to the motion,

384
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:53,625
you can change the direction of
the motion, but you can't change

385
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:56,353
the kinetic energy.
So that's a fundamental

386
00:25:56,353 --> 00:26:00,25
difference between the electric
force and the magnetic force.

387
00:26:00,25 --> 00:26:03,563
So now I want to calculate,
with you, the force on a

388
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,875
current that runs a wire I
through it, and we have a

389
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,928
magnetic field B.
So we're going to be slowly --

390
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:12,785
we're going to be more and more
quantitative.

391
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:18,057
This, by the way,
is often -- also called the

392
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:22,832
Lorenz force,
just a combination of the two.

393
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:28,274
That one certainly is.
So let is start with a -- a

394
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:33,271
wire, and a wire  that runs a
current through,

395
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:37,491
here is the wire,
and the current is I.

396
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:41,156
And let's say,
at this point here,

397
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:49,817
we have a magnetic field B.
And the magnetic field could be

398
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,67
difference along the wire,
in principle.

399
00:26:53,67 --> 00:26:58,609
Here, I have a charge,
plus D Q, and this charge is

400
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:03,548
running through the wire with a
drift velocity V D.

401
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:09,376
Let's first think about what
happens if the current is zero.

402
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:13,623
If the current is zero,
at room temperature,

403
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:18,562
the free electrons in these
wires have huge speeds.

404
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:23,578
Three million meters per
second.

405
00:27:23,578 --> 00:27:26,349
Way larger than the drift
velocity.

406
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:29,446
But they are in all chaotic
directions.

407
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:32,381
Random motion,
it's a thermal motion.

408
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:36,863
And so on each individual
charge, there will be a force.

409
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,39
But they average out to be
zero.

410
00:27:39,39 --> 00:27:44,362
It's not until I run a current
that these charges are going to

411
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,948
walk through with a very slow
drift velocity,

412
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:51,616
and now, of course,
the net force is not zero.

413
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:57,892
So let's have this charge D Q
that moves in this direction,

414
00:27:57,892 --> 00:28:02,106
and so that gives me a current.
And let this angle be theta

415
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:04,721
between them.
Say, that's going to be

416
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:08,718
important, because it's a
cross-product between velocity

417
00:28:08,718 --> 00:28:11,115
and B.
That means the sine of this

418
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:14,894
theta comes in later.
You will say -- I hope you will

419
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:18,018
say, "Well, listen,
man, this is ridiculous.

420
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:21,288
Uh, positive charges don't move
through wires.

421
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:24,412
It is the electrons that move
through wires.

422
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:28,197
They are responsible for the
current.

423
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:31,808
And electrons have a negative
charge, and they go in this

424
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:33,291
direction.
You're right.

425
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,935
Perfectly fine.
However, a negative charge

426
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:39,61
going in this direction is
mathematically exactly the same

427
00:28:39,61 --> 00:28:42,448
as a positive charge going in
that direction.

428
00:28:42,448 --> 00:28:45,349
In both cases,
do we agree that the current is

429
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,799
in this direction.
So I have preferred,

430
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,41
for mathematical reasons,
to take a plus D Q charge going

431
00:28:51,41 --> 00:28:55,215
in this direction rather than
taking a minus D Q charge that

432
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:59,722
goes with the
drift velocity in that

433
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:03,94
direction.
But there is no difference at

434
00:29:03,94 --> 00:29:07,834
all in the outcome that you will
see.

435
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:11,62
So on this charge,
there is a force,

436
00:29:11,62 --> 00:29:16,055
D F -- that's this -- this
magnetic force,

437
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:20,49
and that is the charge D Q,
that equation,

438
00:29:20,49 --> 00:29:24,6
times V cross B.
Well, V was that drift

439
00:29:24,6 --> 00:29:30,689
velocity,
and here is the magnetic field,

440
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:36,033
at this location.
The current through the wire,

441
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:40,563
everywhere on the wire,
must be D Q D T.

442
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:47,301
Because that's the definition
of current, how many Coulombs

443
00:29:47,301 --> 00:29:51,6
per second.
Current is always D Q D T.

444
00:29:51,6 --> 00:29:58,803
So I can also write this as I D
T times V D cross B.

445
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:03,41
But I remember eight oh one,
that V D times D T,

446
00:30:03,41 --> 00:30:07,332
that is speed times a time is a
distance.

447
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:13,214
And I call that distance D L.
It's a distance along the wire.

448
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:18,803
I will put a distance in here
now, because I don't want to

449
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:23,018
clutter up my -- my drawing.
So this charge,

450
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:26,646
in time D T,
moves over that distance,

451
00:30:26,646 --> 00:30:29,734
that's a
vector.

452
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:35,761
Eight oh one.
So I can write down for this

453
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:44,729
product, I can write down D L.
So I can also write down that D

454
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:49,581
F of B equals I times D L cross
B.

455
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:57,226
What is this telling you?
This is the force of a wire

456
00:30:57,226 --> 00:31:03,913
over a small segment
of the wire which has length D

457
00:31:03,913 --> 00:31:08,086
L, I is the current through the
wire, and B is the local

458
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:12,411
magnetic field at that location
D L, that's what it means.

459
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:16,356
And if you want to know the
entire force on the wire,

460
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:19,999
you have to do the integral
along the whole wire.

461
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:24,172
And so you have to do an
integral along the entire wire,

462
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:28,193
and at every portion D L,
you have to determine what B

463
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:30,469
is, and you get,
then, a force,

464
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:35,271
which is
a vector, and you have to add

465
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:40,821
those vectors vectorially.
Could be a pain in the neck,

466
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:46,269
but that's the basic idea.
So now, I want to calculate

467
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:52,23
what the force was on this wire,
roughly, when we ran three

468
00:31:52,23 --> 0.
hundred amperes through there.

469
0. --> 00:31:55,416
Oh, I turned it off instead of

470
00:31:55,416 --> 00:32:02,92
And I make a geometry so simple
that we can execute that

471
00:32:02,92 --> 00:32:05,282
integral.
This was the wire,

472
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:10,183
and we had a current running
through here which was three

473
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:12,284
hundred amperes,
roughly.

474
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:17,097
And we have a magnetic field,
which was right in the gap

475
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:22,086
there, that magnetic field B,
and that was two-tenths of a

476
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:23,836
Tesla.
Two kilogauss.

477
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:27,949
And that magnetic field was
only operating here.

478
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:32,063
It wasn't operating there.
And I

479
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:37,015
make the assumption -- which is
a simplifying assumption -- that

480
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:41,732
that magnetic field was constant
over the portion of the wire

481
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:44,563
which was, say,
only ten centimeters.

482
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:49,122
And so I assume here that I
have a length which is oh point

483
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:53,289
one meters, and that in  during
-- in this range here,

484
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:57,77
the magnetic field is constant.
I just want to get a rough

485
00:32:57,77 --> 00:33:02,016
number for the force on that
wire.

486
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:05,409
So now I can integrate that
equation very easily,

487
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:09,792
because I have assumed that the
magnetic field is perpendicular

488
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:14,175
to the direction D L -- because
D L is now in this direction --

489
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:18,276
so the sine of theta is one,
so I don't have to worry about

490
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:22,659
that -- and so I simply get that
the force on this section F --

491
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,123
of this section L,
that force -- call it F of B if

492
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:29,799
you want to -- is the current I,
which we have there,

493
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,698
we get the length L,
which is this length,

494
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:36,312
multiplied by the magnetic
field.

495
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:41,675
There is no sine I anywhere
because the angels are ninety

496
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:45,218
degrees.
And so I find that that force

497
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:50,389
is three hundred times oh point
one times oh point two,

498
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:55,847
so it is thirty times point
two, that is about six Newton.

499
00:33:55,847 --> 00:34:00,348
Six Newton is more that the
weight of one pound.

500
00:34:00,348 --> 00:34:05,998
And so it is not so surprising
that when I turn this current

501
00:34:05,998 --> 00:34:08,722
on,
that something,

502
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:12,086
all of a sudden,
that something all of a sudden

503
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:16,254
pulls that wire down with a
weight that is equivalent of a

504
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,983
little more than a pound,
almost a pound and a half,

505
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:22,762
actually.
And so it's not so surprising

506
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:27,003
that these supports fell over.
So you see that you can turn

507
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:30,439
this quantitatively,
provided that you make some

508
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:34,754
simplifying assumptions about
the uniformity of the magnetic

509
00:34:34,754 --> 00:34:38,922
field, and about where the
magnetic field

510
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:43,414
is present.
Now, I want to talk about the

511
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,008
great eight oh two motor
contest.

512
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:52,961
We are about to start on this
great eight oh two motor

513
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:59,7
contest, you got an envelope
today, and I'm going to start to

514
00:34:59,7 --> 00:35:03,631
tell you, slowly,
about the physics.

515
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:08,797
The goal is,
ultimately, to build a

516
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:11,62
motor.
If I have a current loop --

517
00:35:11,62 --> 00:35:15,469
here is a current loop.
Current comes in at A,

518
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:19,318
and I'll try to make it -- make
you look at it

519
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:22,824
three-dimensionally,
which is not so easy.

520
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:26,075
This is -- current goes out
here, at D.

521
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:30,095
This is a current loop.
Current go through here,

522
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:32,832
go through here,
go through here,

523
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:36,766
and we turn here.
And we have a magnetic field,

524
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:42,496
we will assume that the
magnetic field is constant

525
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:47,869
throughout, in this direction.
There is a force right here on

526
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:51,182
this wire, in the direction I
cross B.

527
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,674
That force is up.
There is a force here,

528
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:57,629
on this wire,
which is, of course,

529
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:00,673
down.
Magnetic field is in the same

530
00:36:00,673 --> 00:36:05,24
direction, the current is in the
opposite direction,

531
00:36:05,24 --> 00:36:09,627
so the force is down.
If this wire has a length A,

532
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:14,193
this wire has a length A,
that force

533
00:36:14,193 --> 00:36:18,352
-- the magnitude of that force
is the current through the wire

534
00:36:18,352 --> 00:36:21,488
times the length of the wire
times the B field.

535
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:24,419
We just derived that.
There's that integral,

536
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:27,76
we just assume that the
magnetic field is constant

537
00:36:27,76 --> 00:36:30,964
everywhere here,
there, at ninety-degree angles,

538
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:34,509
so the sine of theta is one,
and so that's the force.

539
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:37,849
What is the force here and what
is the force here?

540
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:41,053
Well, it's zero.
Zero here, and it is zero here.

541
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:43,78
Why is that?
Because the cross-product is

542
00:36:43,78 --> 00:36:47,461
zero.
No matter how you look at it,

543
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:50,794
you can say D L and B are
either in the same direction or

544
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,71
in opposite directions.
You can also say the drift

545
00:36:53,71 --> 00:36:57,46
velocity and B are either in the
same or the opposite direct- it

546
00:36:57,46 --> 00:37:00,138
is all the same thing.
There is no force here,

547
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:03,471
and there is no force here.
Because that equation that we

548
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,387
had that gives us the magnetic
force becomes zero.

549
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:10,017
The sine of that angle is zero.
So what's going to happen with

550
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:12,517
this thing?
Well, there is a torque on this

551
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:14,243
system.
There is no net force,

552
00:37:14,243 --> 00:37:18,17
because this force up is the
same as this force

553
00:37:18,17 --> 00:37:21,71
down, but there is a torque
which wants to rotate in

554
00:37:21,71 --> 00:37:25,319
counterclockwise direction.
And the magnitude of that

555
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:28,927
torque is, of course,
this force -- you remember from

556
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:32,744
eight oh one -- times the
perpendicular distance between

557
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:35,867
these two forces,
and so the magnitude of that

558
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:39,476
torque is I times A B times B at
this moment in time,

559
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:41,835
when the forces are this far
apart.

560
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:45,375
Now, this is going to rotate,
and so as they rotate,

561
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:50,667
these forces come closer,
and so the torque will become

562
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,126
less.
Still, it wants to rotate

563
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:56,405
counterclockwise.
And there comes a time,

564
00:37:56,405 --> 00:38:00,094
ninety degrees later,
that the torque is zero.

565
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:03,946
And I will try to make you see
that, again, in a

566
00:38:03,946 --> 00:38:07,717
three-dimensional way,
it's not so easy for me.

567
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:10,422
Now, this is D,
this has become D,

568
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:15,176
a current always leaves at D.
I'll try to make you see this

569
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:19,773
three-dimensionally.
It goes like this,

570
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:23,704
current comes in here,
at A, so we get this,

571
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:27,27
and we get this.
It doesn't look so bad.

572
00:38:27,27 --> 00:38:32,481
And the magnetic field B has
not changed, uniform B in the

573
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:36,321
same direction.
So the current now comes in

574
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:41,897
through A, it has not changed,
the only thing is that the loop

575
00:38:41,897 --> 00:38:46,743
has rotated ninety degrees.
If, now I ask you what the

576
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:51,862
forces are, you have to go I
cross

577
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:52,953
B.
I cross B.

578
00:38:52,953 --> 00:38:57,585
If you do I cross B here,
I cross B, you get a force

579
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:02,218
which is towards you.
Here, you get forces which are

580
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:06,487
in the blackboard.
Here you get forces which are

581
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:10,302
up, and here you get forces
which are down.

582
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:15,298
At home, you will have some
time to use your right hand,

583
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:18,75
and do the I cross B,
and you will see,

584
00:39:18,75 --> 00:39:23,708
then, that, indeed,
all these forces are in the

585
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,685
direction that I put them.
So now, there is,

586
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:28,97
again, no net force on the
system.

587
00:39:28,97 --> 00:39:31,394
There was no net force here,
either.

588
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:33,748
But now, there is no torque
either.

589
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:36,102
So now, the torque has become
zero.

590
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:39,426
If we rotate it a little
further, it is possible,

591
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:42,818
then we start this motor,
starts to rotate counter

592
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:46,557
clockwise, comes to this
position, torque goes to zero,

593
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:50,435
but it has enough inertia so it
rotates a little further.

594
00:39:50,435 --> 00:39:54,036
And now the torque will
reverse.

595
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:57,233
And this is something that I
leave you alone with,

596
00:39:57,233 --> 00:40:01,149
I don't want to make another
drawing and convince you that it

597
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,107
reverses.
But it's easy to see,

598
00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:06,631
because, take this thing,
and just flip it over hundred

599
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:09,242
eighty degrees.
The magnetic field hasn't

600
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:12,897
changed, but the currents in
these two sides have changed

601
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:15,703
direction now,
because whatever is D is here

602
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:18,379
and A is here.
And so the torque reverses,

603
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:21,903
and so it goes like this,
[wssshhht], and then [wsshht]

604
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:26,974
it comes back.
And that's not much of a motor.

605
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:30,645
Current meters are very
frequently used,

606
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:35,069
they are in your cars,
many more than you think,

607
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:39,398
your, um, your fuel gauge and
your temperature,

608
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:43,163
of the cooling water,
are current meters.

609
00:40:43,163 --> 00:40:46,552
And a current meter works as
follows.

610
00:40:46,552 --> 00:40:50,411
We attach to this loop a
needle, a handle,

611
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:55,117
and we calibrate it here.
And you can read how many

612
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:59,438
amperes
are going through this meter.

613
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:01,742
It wants to go
counterclockwise.

614
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:05,46
Here, we attach a spring,
and the spring produces a

615
00:41:05,46 --> 00:41:08,88
counter-torque,
and so the needle will start to

616
00:41:08,88 --> 00:41:13,192
deflect, but come to a halt.
But if you double the current,

617
00:41:13,192 --> 00:41:16,761
it will go further.
That's the way that a current

618
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:19,958
meter works.
And your fuel gauge in your car

619
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:23,452
is a current meter,
except that the level of the

620
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:27,764
fuel is somehow converted into
an electric

621
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:30,86
signal, and then it's sent to a
current meter,

622
00:41:30,86 --> 00:41:34,437
and that's what you're reading.
And it is, of course,

623
00:41:34,437 --> 00:41:37,532
calibrated in terms of how much
fuel you have.

624
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:41,659
And your temperature gauge is
calibrated in terms of degrees,

625
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:43,861
whatever, Fahrenheit or
whatever.

626
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:47,644
So these current meters are
very common, even when we're

627
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:51,633
dealing with something that has
nothing to do with current.

628
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:54,454
How do you build,
now, a motor that works?

629
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:58,394
How do you get over this torque
reversal?

630
00:41:58,394 --> 00:42:02,437
Well, it's not only the torque
reversal that is a problem,

631
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:06,41
but there is also the problem
that if you could keep this

632
00:42:06,41 --> 00:42:09,176
going around,
that these two wires would

633
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:11,446
intertwine, and they would
break.

634
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:15,631
You roll it around a hundred
times, you can see what happens

635
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:19,249
at A and D, it will break.
So you have to think of a

636
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:23,221
design whereby you have slipping
contacts -- we call them

637
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:24,853
brushes.
Suppose I have,

638
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:27,903
here, a conductor which is
connected with A,

639
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:31,964
physically soldered to the wire
at A.

640
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:35,426
And here, I have a conductor
which is D.

641
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:38,533
So the -- the loop is where you
are.

642
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:42,261
Soldered wires coming out the
loop is here.

643
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:47,143
But now the battery -- plus
side of the battery is here,

644
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:50,782
and the minus side of the
battery of here,

645
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:54,599
and this is a slipping contact.
In practice,

646
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,126
we call them brushes.
So that immediately takes care

647
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:04,007
of the problem,
that the wires wind up.

648
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:07,983
But there is something else
which is very clever about this

649
00:43:07,983 --> 00:43:10,45
design.
If the gap between A and D is

650
00:43:10,45 --> 00:43:13,261
an insulator,
then, what's going to happen

651
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:16,002
when this rotates hundred eighty
degrees?

652
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:20,184
A, which now is on the positive
side of the battery -- this is

653
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,829
negative, of course,
heh?

654
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:25,05
-- A is now on the positive
side of the battery,

655
00:43:25,05 --> 00:43:28,203
if you -- if you rotate hundred
eighty degrees,

656
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:31,287
A will be on the negative side
of the battery.

657
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:33,961
So now every rotation,
the current will,

658
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:37,638
all by itself,
change direction.

659
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:41,923
And we call that a commutator.
And so now, what's going to

660
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:45,607
happen is, now the torque
reversal will not occur.

661
00:43:45,607 --> 00:43:49,741
If, at the right moment,
the current switches direction,

662
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:54,252
the torque will always want to
rotate the loop in exactly the

663
00:43:54,252 --> 00:43:57,184
same direction.
That's the idea behind a

664
00:43:57,184 --> 00:44:00,116
commutator.
The great eight oh two motor

665
00:44:00,116 --> 00:44:02,297
contest.
You have an envelope,

666
00:44:02,297 --> 00:44:06,056
when you open it up -- don't do
it

667
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:09,946
now -- you will find in there a
copper wire, two meters

668
00:44:09,946 --> 00:44:12,396
insulated copper wire,
two magnets,

669
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:14,558
two paper clips,
and some wood.

670
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:19,025
And the idea is that you try to
build a motor that runs as fast

671
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:22,123
as possible.
For every hundred RPM -- an RPM

672
00:44:22,123 --> 00:44:26,446
is a rotation per minute -- for
every hundred -- hundred RPM,

673
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:30,913
I'll give you one credit point,
with a maximum of twenty credit

674
00:44:30,913 --> 00:44:33,435
points.
So if your motor runs t- two

675
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:38,335
thousand RPM or more,
you get twenty credit points.

676
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:41,539
That is equivalent to two
homework assignments.

677
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:45,37
And these credit points count
over and above your course

678
00:44:45,37 --> 00:44:47,598
grade.
You have my word for that.

679
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:51,708
I'll give you a final course
grade, the way that you've seen

680
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:54,564
in the ground rules,
in the first handout,

681
00:44:54,564 --> 00:44:57,907
and we add your motor contest,
what you deserved.

682
00:44:57,907 --> 00:45:00,693
For every hundred RPM,
you get one point,

683
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:03,34
plus, with a maximum of,
uh, of twenty.

684
00:45:03,34 --> 00:45:07,589
And we're going to test these
motors on these second of April,

685
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:12,744
an I gave you a handout in
which I give you some hints,

686
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:15,451
some ideas.
There is one idea that I gave

687
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:18,97
you which you may ignore,
and that is to overcome the

688
00:45:18,97 --> 00:45:21,881
torque reversal,
you can build a commutator.

689
00:45:21,881 --> 00:45:24,453
But that's, uh,
that's really not easy.

690
00:45:24,453 --> 00:45:27,431
Not only is it not easy,
but when you built a

691
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:30,747
commutator, your system may get
a lot of friction,

692
00:45:30,747 --> 00:45:33,116
and you may lose more than you
gain.

693
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:36,703
There is an alternative
solution, which I mentioned in

694
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:40,494
my handout that you picked up
today, and that is that you

695
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:44,826
design your motor in such a way
that when the

696
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,797
reversal, when the torque
reversal occurs,

697
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:50,769
that there is no current
running any more.

698
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:54,973
And when it is half a rotation
further, the torque is there

699
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:57,365
again, the current is there
again.

700
00:45:57,365 --> 00:46:00,409
So for half the time,
you stop the current,

701
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:04,685
you will see that's very easy,
I give you some hints how you

702
00:46:04,685 --> 00:46:07,077
do that.
So you have to weigh that

703
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:10,556
against the possibility of
building a commutator.

704
00:46:10,556 --> 00:46:13,963
The bottom line is,
the maximum is twenty credit

705
00:46:13,963 --> 00:46:17,876
points.
That's an equivalent of two

706
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:21,808
homework assignments.
You get it over and above your

707
00:46:21,808 --> 00:46:24,353
course grade.
And it's also great,

708
00:46:24,353 --> 00:46:27,282
fun, believe me.
What more do you want?

709
00:46:27,282 --> 00:46:30,289
To do physics,
get credit, and have fun.

710
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:34,529
That's what I do every day,
that's the great thing about

711
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:37,151
physics.
We have five minutes left,

712
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:41,545
and in those five minutes,
I'm going to demonstrate to you

713
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:44,552
a motor.
What you see there is a current

714
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:49,332
loop -- I'll try to make you see
it three-dimensionally -- this

715
00:46:49,332 --> 00:46:54,896
is the current loop,
and we're going to run a

716
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:59,052
current in this direction,
and we, here,

717
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:01,929
have a magnet,
north, south,

718
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:05,658
magnetic field is in this
direction.

719
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:08,535
And we, here,
have a magnet,

720
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:13,117
north, south,
magnetic field is also in this

721
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:16,954
direction.
I'm going to run a current

722
00:47:16,954 --> 00:47:21,322
through here,
and if the current is in the

723
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:25,772
blackboard,
I cross B -- I is in,

724
00:47:25,772 --> 00:47:29,216
cross B, force is up.
This side wants to go up.

725
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:33,634
If this side wants to go up,
since the magnetic field is the

726
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:37,078
same direction here,
but the current is hundred

727
00:47:37,078 --> 00:47:41,196
eighty degrees in opposite
direction, this force will be

728
00:47:41,196 --> 00:47:43,891
down.
And so there's a torque on this

729
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:45,988
motor.
And you will see that.

730
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:50,255
You will see that go like this.
However, when it's hundred

731
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:54,598
eighty degrees and it swings
here, by, it wants to go back,

732
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:58,272
because of
the torque reversal.

733
00:47:58,272 --> 00:48:01,901
That's the first thing that I
want to show you.

734
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:05,767
And I think I don't need any
changes in the light.

735
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:09,79
So here, we have this loop,
and here we have the two

736
00:48:09,79 --> 00:48:13,34
magnets -- the magnetic field
is, by no means,

737
00:48:13,34 --> 00:48:16,654
uniform, by the way,
it's very strong here,

738
00:48:16,654 --> 00:48:21,072
and it's very strong there.
And now I have to power that.

739
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:23,596
Hmm, there we go.
I can't -- yes,

740
00:48:23,596 --> 00:48:28,96
I think I know that this one
will come up this side,

741
00:48:28,96 --> 00:48:32,626
I'm fairly sure that I have the
directions right.

742
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:35,986
Let's first take a look at it.
There it goes.

743
00:48:35,986 --> 00:48:38,811
So when it's here,
notice, it goes up.

744
00:48:38,811 --> 00:48:42,705
But now, if I power it here
again, wants to go back.

745
00:48:42,705 --> 00:48:46,829
So here, wants to go up,
and here, it wants to go back.

746
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:50,8
So we've got to do something.
And that something is a

747
00:48:50,8 --> 00:48:53,778
commutator.
So if we can somehow reverse

748
00:48:53,778 --> 00:48:59,429
the current when it's here,
then it wants to go down again.

749
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:01,927
I'll show you that.
So now it's here.

750
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:05,328
And I'll drive the current in
the other direction.

751
00:49:05,328 --> 00:49:07,688
You ready for that?
Did you notice?

752
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:11,02
It now wants to go down.
Now it wants to go down.

753
00:49:11,02 --> 00:49:14,421
But when it's here,
I have to reverse the current,

754
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:17,822
it wants to go up.
And if I do that with my hands,

755
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:20,737
I can see whether I can keep
this rotating.

756
00:49:20,737 --> 00:49:24,138
It may take me a while,
but I'll do my best I can.

757
00:49:24,138 --> 00:49:26,151
There it goes.
Switch, switch,

758
00:49:26,151 --> 00:49:29,621
switch, switch,
switch, switch,

759
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:31,164
switch, switch,
switch.

760
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:32,916
Yes, got it,
yes I got it.

761
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:36,071
I'm a commutator!
This motor is going at least

762
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:40,067
sixty RPM, that's one credit
point for me for this course.

763
00:49:40,067 --> 49:45
Thank you.
