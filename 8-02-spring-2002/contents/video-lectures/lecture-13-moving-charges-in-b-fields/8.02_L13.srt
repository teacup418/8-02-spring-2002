1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,721



2
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:03,503
All right, you did well on the
exam.

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,954
Class average was sixty-two.
I always aim for sixty-five,

4
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:11,451
so I was very happy.
Eleven students scored a

5
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:14,392
hundred.
I believe that my exam review

6
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:18,287
was extremely fair.
According to some instructors,

7
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:20,99
perhaps even too close for
comfort.

8
00:00:20,99 --> 00:00:25,203
I did a problem with parallel
resistors and a battery.

9
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:28,859
I applied Gauss's Law for
cylindrical symmetry.

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,027
I spent quite a bit of time
discussing  where charge

11
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:38,413
occurs and where charge  can not
be located on conductors  and I

12
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:42,45
hit the idea of capacitors and
dielectrics also quite hard.

13
00:00:42,45 --> 00:00:46,627
I prefer not to think about a
rigid division between pass and

14
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:50,803
fail, but I'd rather tell you
that all of you who scored less

15
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:54,075
than forty-seven,
in my book, are sort of in the

16
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,79
danger zone.
Now, that doesn't mean that

17
00:00:56,79 --> 00:01:04,316
you're going to fail the course,
nor does it mean that you will

18
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:07,159
pass the course if you scored
seventy.

19
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,156
But those people are in the
danger zone.

20
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:14,843
I think you should talk to your
instructor, and I would advise

21
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:18,915
those people also to make
frequent use  of our tutors.

22
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:21,297
Two exams to go,
plus the final.

23
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:25,908
Today I'm going to uncover a
whole new world for you  and you

24
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:30,672
will see how eight oh two comes
in there in a very natural way.

25
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:38,049
The Lawrence force F is the
charge  times the cross product

26
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:43,849
of the velocity of that charge
and the B field that the charge

27
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:47,463
experiences.
If I have here  a positive

28
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:52,788
charge plus Q  and it has a
velocity V in this direction,

29
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:58,589
and the magnetic fields would
be uniform and coming out of the

30
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:04,675
blackboards, there's going to be
a force on this charge according

31
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:11,807
to this relationship  and the
force

32
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:14,632
is then  like so.
Perpendicular to V,

33
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:18,085
perpendicular to B.
In this case  the charged

34
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:21,459
particle is going to go around
in a circle .

35
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,833
The Lawrence force can not
change the speed,

36
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:29,07
can not change the kinetic
energy, because the force is

37
00:02:29,07 --> 00:02:33,542
always perpendicular to the
velocity but it can change the

38
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:37,779
direction of the velocity.
And so, what you're going to

39
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:44,228
see is
that the charged particle will

40
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:48,943
go around into a perfect circle
if  the magnetic field is

41
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:53,069
constant throughout.
And the radius of this circle

42
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:58,037
can very easily be calculated
using some of our knowledge of

43
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:01,405
eight oh two.
The force is QVB  because I

44
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:06,625
chose B also perpendicular to V,
and so there is no sign of the

45
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:10,666
angle between them.
This one, and this now has to

46
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:16,639
be the
centripetal force that we

47
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,291
encountered in eight oh one,
which is MV squared divided by

48
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:26,19
R, M now being the mass of this
particle.

49
00:03:26,19 --> 00:03:31,355
And so you'll find now that R
equals MV divided by QB.

50
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:35,448
And this, by the way,
I want to remind you,

51
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,566
is the momentum of that
particle.

52
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:43,537
If you look at this equation,
it's sort of pleasing.

53
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:48,272
If the
charge is high then the

54
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:52,197
Lawrence force is high so the
radius is small.

55
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:57,431
If the magnetic field is high
then the Lawrence force is high

56
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:02,054
so the radius is small.
If the mass of the particle is

57
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:07,374
high, there is a lot of inertia
and so it is very difficult to

58
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:09,991
make it go around,
so to speak,

59
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:14,353
so a very high mass,
you expect a very high radius.

60
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:18,539
And so that looks all
intuitively quite pleasing.

61
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,069
Let's do a numerical example.

62
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,163

63
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,505
I take a proton,
P stands for proton,

64
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:31,891
and I take a one MEV proton.
It's the same I took during my

65
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:35,791
test review.
One MEV means that the kinetic

66
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:41,455
energy is one MEV is the charge
times the potential difference

67
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:46,283
over which this proton was
accelerated, in this case,

68
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:49,44
delta V would be one million
volts.

69
00:04:49,44 --> 00:04:53,805
And this now equals one-half
times

70
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:57,653
the mass of that proton times
the velocity squared.

71
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:00,347
In this case,
if I have the one MEV,

72
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:04,58
so it is a million volts,
you will find that this is one

73
00:05:04,58 --> 00:05:08,275
point six times ten to the minus
thirteen joules.

74
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:13,047
I gave you there the charge of
the proton, you multiplied it by

75
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,587
a million, and this is the
energy.

76
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:19,974
And so now you can calculate
the velocity because you know

77
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:23,437
the mass of the proton.
I gave

78
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:24,948
you that too,
there.

79
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:29,481
And so you will find exactly
what you found during my test

80
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:34,014
review, one point four times ten
to the seventh meters per

81
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:38,069
second, which is five percent of
the speed of light,

82
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,523
comfortably low so we don't
have to make any relativistic

83
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:45,624
corrections.
If this proton now enters a

84
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:48,487
magnetic field B,
which is one Tesla,

85
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:51,906
then  by using the equation I
have up there,

86
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:56,36
you know the mass of the
proton,

87
00:05:56,36 --> 00:05:59,263
we just calculated the
velocity.

88
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:04,696
You know the charge of the
proton and you know the B field.

89
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:09,192
You will find that R is oh
point one five meters,

90
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:14,25
which is fifteen centimeters,
just a numerical example.

91
00:06:14,25 --> 00:06:18,09
It is more common,
or at least often done,

92
00:06:18,09 --> 00:06:23,242
to eliminate out of that
equation there the velocity and

93
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:28,113
replace it by the potential
difference,

94
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:32,702
capital V, over which we
accelerate these particles.

95
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:37,651
And so, what you can do,
you can replace this V by using

96
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:42,15
the equation I have there,
the one half MV squared,

97
00:06:42,15 --> 00:06:47,369
so we have that one-half MV
squared equals Q times delta V,

98
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:52,678
but I will write for that just
a capital V, and I substitute

99
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,817
this V now in here,
and so I now longer see the

100
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:01,496
velocity
but I now see this potential

101
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:05,282
difference.
In the case of that proton,

102
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:10,961
this V would be a million and
you will find then that R is

103
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:16,939
then the square root of two M
times that capital V divided by

104
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:21,223
Q B squared.
And so the two equations are of

105
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:25,408
course the same physics,
but it's different

106
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:29,891
representation.
If you put in for V now ten to

107
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:36,012
the sixth mass of the proton,
charge of the proton,

108
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:40,385
and one Tesla field,
of course you find exactly the

109
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:45,458
same point one five meters.
Now this is all nice and dandy,

110
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:50,618
but this works as long as the
speed is much smaller than the

111
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:54,466
speed of light.
If that's no longer the case,

112
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:59,714
then we have to apply special
relativity and that is not part

113
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:04,699
of this course but I would like
to briefly touch upon that

114
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,83
today.
I can show you how things go

115
00:08:09,83 --> 00:08:17,197
sour because suppose we have a
five hundred kilo electric volt

116
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:21,423
electron.
So that means that in this

117
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:26,858
equation here,
the V is five hundred thousand,

118
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:33,621
the Q is the charge of the
electron, M is now the mass of

119
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:38,811
the electron,
and if I apply that equation I

120
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:43,555
find that V is four point two
times ten to the eighth meters

121
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:47,816
per second and that is larger
than the speed of light,

122
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:51,676
so that's clearly not possible.
The actual speed,

123
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:55,938
if you make relativistic
corrections, is two point six

124
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:59,234
times ten to the eighth meters
per second.

125
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:03,657
And although I don't expect you
to be able to make those

126
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:08,079
relativistic corrections,
I will make them today and you

127
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,244
will
see why I have to,

128
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:16
and I want to show you that in
fact this is not all that

129
00:09:16 --> 00:09:21,362
difficult even though I will not
hold you responsible for these

130
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:24,475
equations.
So what I have here is now

131
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:26,81
kinetic energy,
is again QV,

132
00:09:26,81 --> 00:09:30,961
that's not changing,
but is no longer one-half MV

133
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:35,284
squared but it is gamma minus
one times MC squared,

134
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:41,683
and gamma is defined there --
it's called the Lorenz Factor,

135
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:46,253
and so if you know now for the
electron that capital V is five

136
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,849
hundred thousand,
you can calculate what gamma is

137
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:54,418
from the first equation and then
you go to the second equation

138
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:58,988
and you find what the speed is,
and you will see then that you

139
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:02,658
never find a speed larger than
the speed of light.

140
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:07,078
And so we now have to make the
correction also for the radii

141
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,873
and those corrections become
again relatively easy.

142
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:15,765
This now requires a factor
gamma and you see that on the

143
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:19,233
upper blackboard there,
and this too now has to be

144
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:23,267
replaced by this gamma plus one
and then everything is OK.

145
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:27,371
So I don't expect you to know
this, but I don't want you to

146
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:30,839
think that all these
relativistic corrections come

147
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,166
out of the blue,
nor do I want you think that it

148
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,572
is very difficult.
It really isn't.

149
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:39,615
The equations are extremely
straightforward.

150
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:41,313

151
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:46,261
So I want to show you now some
of the results that we just

152
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:49,82
discussed.
The one MEV proton and the five

153
00:10:49,82 --> 00:10:53,292
hundred KEV electron,
this is on the Web.

154
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:57,805
You can click on Lecture
Supplements and you can make

155
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:01,972
yourself a hard copy.
So here you see the kinetic

156
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:06,051
energy, one MEV proton.
Notice the speed that we

157
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:09,176
calculated there is
non-relativistic,

158
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:14,5
gamma is very close to one.
You don't have to make a

159
00:11:14,5 --> 00:11:17,228
correction.
And in a one Tesla field you

160
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:20,654
get a radius of fifteen
centimeters, which we just

161
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:23,102
calculated.
If you go to a fifty MEV

162
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:27,159
proton, it's sort of in the
borderline between relativistic

163
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:30,516
and non-relativistic.
It's still non-relativistic

164
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:34,152
enough, and if it is
non-relativistic you can clearly

165
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,349
see here that the radius goes
with the square root of capital

166
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,747
V.
And for fifty MEV,

167
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:44,059
capital V is fifty million,
and for one MEV,

168
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:47,771
capital V is one million.
And since it goes with the

169
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:51,12
square root of V,
you expect roughly the radius

170
00:11:51,12 --> 00:11:55,341
to be the square root of fifty
times larger which is seven,

171
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:58,908
and indeed, you see that.
So you see, from fifteen

172
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:02,256
centimeters the radius goes to
about one meter.

173
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:05,24
Um, here is our five hundred
KEV electron,

174
00:12:05,24 --> 00:12:08,661
and notice that I did the
calculation correctly.

175
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:13,257
This is relativistically
corrected now.

176
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:17,955
You get your two point six
times ten to the eighth meters

177
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:22,654
per second  by applying the
formalism that you see there.

178
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:26,513
I will leave this here
throughout this lecture,

179
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:30,121
because I will return to this
several times.

180
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:33,644
I want to show you a  a cute
demonstration.

181
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:37
I have an, er,
electron gun here  and the

182
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42,789
electron gun  comes like
so.

183
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:45,885
This is the velocity of the
electrons.

184
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:50,153
I put a minus sign there to
remind you that they are

185
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,915
electrons.
If electrons go in this

186
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:56,681
direction, the current goes in
that direction.

187
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:01,703
And so if now I have a magnetic
field which, let's assume the

188
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:04,632
magnetic field is in the
blackboard.

189
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:08,063
This is B.
Then I cross B is the direction

190
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:11,076
of the force.
I is in this direction,

191
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:16,103
B is in the blackboard.
So if I'm not mistaken,

192
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:20,057
I think the force is in this
direction and so you will see

193
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,832
that it starts to bend in this
direction.

194
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:26,231
If you change the direction of
the magnetic field,

195
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:29,7
the magnetic field is coming
out of the blackboard,

196
00:13:29,7 --> 00:13:32,683
then the electron will go in
this direction,

197
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:36,637
and I can show you that here.
It is not too different from

198
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:40,591
the distortion experiment I did
when I had the  television

199
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:45,03
program there and I had the
strong magnet

200
00:13:45,03 --> 00:13:50,822
and we distorted the image,
but this of course is a little

201
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:55,495
bit more controlled.
So, we're going to see the

202
00:13:55,495 --> 00:14:01,287
image there and we want to make
it quite dark in the room.

203
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,741
Mmm.
And turn on the  electron gun.

204
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:11,142
So you see, the electron gun it
strikes a fluorescent screen and

205
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:19,592
that's how you can see it,
and I have here a bar magnet

206
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:26,377
and if I hold the bar magnet
behind it then I can create more

207
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:33,048
or less situations like this.
I can flip over the magnet and

208
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:37,911
then the direction of bending
should change,

209
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:42,773
so here I come with the magnet,
and you see,

210
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:48,54
curve up the electrons.
I turn the magnet over and I

211
00:14:48,54 --> 00:14:52,272
come in again and they curve
down.

212
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:56,004
Very straightforward,
very simple.

213
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:56,343
OK.

214
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:59,961

215
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:05,452
There is a fantastic way in
physics that we can separate

216
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:09,246
isotopes from one and the same
element.

217
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:12,541
If we, for instance,
take uranium,

218
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,436
now uranium,
when you find it,

219
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:20,327
is for ninety-nine point three
percent uranium two

220
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:24,421
thirty-eight.
That means it had ninety-two

221
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:29,912
protons, otherwise it wouldn't
be uranium,

222
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:32,913
and it has hundred and
forty-six neutrons,

223
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:35,182
ninety-nine point three
percent.

224
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:38,549
Point seven percent is uranium
two thirty-five.

225
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:42,209
Again, ninety-two protons,
otherwise it wouldn't be

226
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:46,016
uranium, but only a hundred and
forty-three neutrons,

227
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:50,188
and that you'll find in nature
for oh point seven percent.

228
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:54,58
So you go to a chemist and you
give a chemist a little bit of

229
00:15:54,58 --> 00:15:58,533
uranium and you say would you
please separate these two

230
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:02,956
isotopes for me,
and he of course would laugh at

231
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:06,452
you and he would say go fly a
kite because the chemical

232
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:10,402
properties are exactly the same
for the two because uranium is

233
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,473
uranium.
Neutral uranium here has

234
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:16,293
ninety-two electrons and neutral
uranium here has ninety-two

235
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:20,114
electrons, so there's no way
that they could separate those.

236
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:23,869
And I will show you now how
they can be separated with what

237
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:27,689
we call a mass spectrometer.
You heat the uranium so that it

238
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:30,149
ionizes.
Let's assume it's ionized once

239
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,179
so it
loses one electron,

240
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:36,991
so it's positively charged with
one unit charge,

241
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:40,072
one of those charges that you
see here.

242
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:44,938
And we now accelerate it over
certain potential difference so

243
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:48,749
these uranium atoms,
two thirty-five and the two

244
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:53,858
thirty-eight get a certain speed
and they come in here with this

245
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:58,886
speed V, so they're positively
charged and let's assume that we

246
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:03,84
have a magnetic
field that is uniform and that

247
00:17:03,84 --> 00:17:08,09
is in this direction,
comes out of the blackboard.

248
00:17:08,09 --> 00:17:13,035
So what will happen is that
these  charged particles which

249
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:16,765
are positively charged now,
one unit charge,

250
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:20,581
are going to go around a circle
and hit here.

251
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,571
It is the radius.
But if you look here at these

252
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:32,291
equations  so you will see that
the radius is proportional with

253
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:36,568
the square root of the mass of
the particle and the mass of two

254
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:40,706
thirty-eight is one point two
percent larger than the mass of

255
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,533
two thirty-five.
And so with one point two

256
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:46,568
percent larger,
since we have the square root

257
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:50,568
there, we see here the square
root, we accelerate them over

258
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:54,499
the same potential difference,
so this one doesn't change.

259
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:56,913
This is the only thing that
changes.

260
00:17:56,913 --> 00:18:01,189
So then you expect an oh point
six percent change in radius and

261
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:04,498
so the
two thirty-eight will end up

262
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,651
here.
I exaggerate that very highly.

263
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:09,112
And the two thirty-five will
end up here.

264
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:12,558
The two thirty-eight has a
larger radius because it has a

265
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,65
larger mass, and you see that
here.

266
00:18:14,65 --> 00:18:17,48
There's no change in B,
there's no change in Q,

267
00:18:17,48 --> 00:18:19,571
and there's no change in
capital V.

268
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:22,832
We accelerate them over the
same potential difference.

269
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,924
And so if the radius,
for instance,

270
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:28,554
were one meter of this mass
spectrometer then the difference

271
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:32,368
here -- remember this is two R
-- the difference would come out

272
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:35,578
to be
about one point two

273
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:40,632
centimeters, and so you have a
collector here where you collect

274
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:45,442
your two thirty-eight nuclei
atoms and here you collect your

275
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:50,578
two thirty-five and that is the
idea behind a mass spectrometer.

276
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:53,838
Why did I choose this
particular example?

277
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:58,403
Well, this example changed our
world and it made history.

278
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:03,213
Uranium two thirty-five was
needed by the Americans to build

279
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:07,859
an atomic bomb to end the Second
World War.

280
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,088
This is- this was done under
the famous Manhattan Project.

281
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:16,687
And Ernest Lawrence of Berkeley
built mass spectrometers  which

282
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:20,619
were able to separate uranium
two thirty-five from two

283
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,845
thirty-eight.
In the beginning,

284
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:26,406
it went very slowly,
about one hundred micrograms

285
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:28,705
per day.
But a few kilograms was

286
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:33,008
required for an atomic bomb.
They finally managed to get up

287
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:36,643
to one gram per day  and in
combination with other

288
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:41,538
separation
techniques such as the gas

289
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:45,744
diffusion techniques which I
will not discuss here now  they

290
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:49,737
managed to get a few kilograms
and they dropped a bomb on

291
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:53,587
Hiroshima on August sixth
nineteen forty-five and three

292
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,51
days later a bomb was dropped on
Nagasaki.

293
00:19:56,51 --> 00:20:00,787
The Japanese surrendered and it
was the end of World War Two.

294
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:04,922
It's a good thing that there
are many peaceful applications

295
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:09,057
nowadays of mass spectrometers,
particularly in the medical

296
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:13,018
area.
People sometimes require

297
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:17,112
radiation and they need
radiation from a particular

298
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:21,123
radioactive isotopes,
but you don't want the other

299
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:25,953
isotopes from the same element
and so you separate them then

300
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:29,801
with a mass spectrometer.
It's a whole industry,

301
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:33,976
very important industry.
And I would like to address

302
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:38,315
the issue how you accelerate
protons to extremely high

303
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:43,882
speeds, almost approaching the
speed of light.

304
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:50,448
And that is also something for
which Ernest Lawrence is

305
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:55,069
credited.
In the early days it was done

306
00:20:55,069 --> 00:21:00,298
in a cyclotron,
which I will describe to you

307
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:04,068
now.
The cyclotron consists of a

308
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:10,391
chamber which is called a D.
This is one D and here's

309
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:16,914
another D.
These are conducting chambers.

310
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:21,608
If you look from the side it
would look like so.

311
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:27,3
This is the left chamber and
this is the right chamber and

312
00:21:27,3 --> 00:21:32,793
all of this is in vacuum and
let's assume that we have a

313
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:37,387
magnetic field coming out of the
board like so.

314
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:40,583
Let's revisit our one MEV
proton.

315
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:45,077
Suppose I release in this
chamber

316
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:49
here a one MEV proton and I
know the speed with which it

317
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52,922
comes out, because the one MEV
proton had a speed -- Oh,

318
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:56,773
you still see it there,
one point four times ten to the

319
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,339
seven meters per second.
We also know that in a one

320
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:04,831
Tesla field, let's make this one
Tesla, that the radius is going

321
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:08,112
to be fifteen centimeters.
You see it up there.

322
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:10,537
So what is this proton going to
do?

323
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,746
It's going to do this.
But when it gets there,

324
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:19,04
the potential difference is
introduced between these two

325
00:22:19,04 --> 00:22:23,739
D's, so that this is low pot-
high potential and this is a low

326
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:26,743
potential.
And so you're going to get an

327
00:22:26,743 --> 00:22:31,288
electric field now in this gap
in this direction and so this

328
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:35,447
proton is being accelerated.
And let's suppose that the

329
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:38,76
difference in potential is
twenty kilovolts.

330
00:22:38,76 --> 00:22:43,15
Then this proton will gain in
electric- in kinetic energy,

331
00:22:43,15 --> 00:22:46,924
it will gain kinetic energy,
twenty

332
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:52,339
kilo electron volts.
That's the way electron volt is

333
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:56,267
defined.
And so you start off with one

334
00:22:56,267 --> 00:23:02,531
MEV, so when it has  crossed
this gap it is now one point oh

335
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:05,079
two MEV.
Twenty KEV more.

336
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,84
The radius, now,
is larger.

337
00:23:07,84 --> 00:23:13,254
If capital V is two percent
higher, and I go to this

338
00:23:13,254 --> 00:23:19,585
equation,
then the radius is one percent

339
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:24,229
higher and so when it comes out
here and it makes a circle,

340
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:29,113
the radius now is one percent
higher than fifteen centimeters.

341
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:33,437
But when it gets to this  part
of the D, this potential

342
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:38,161
difference is reversed and so
the electric field is again in

343
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:41,764
this direction,
in the direction of the proton

344
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:46,568
and so it is accelerated again
by twenty kilo electron volts.

345
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:51,411
Now the radius,
of course, is even larger and

346
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:55,131
so very gradually every time
that it reaches the gap the

347
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:59,255
potential difference is changed
in direction to accelerate the

348
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:02,231
proton and so it gradually
spirals out, then,

349
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:04,597
to the largest radius that you
have.

350
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:08,79
So during one full rotation it
gains twenty kilo electron volts

351
00:24:08,79 --> 00:24:12,847
once, and twenty kilo electron
volts twice, so it gains forty

352
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:16,228
kilo electron volts.
And so the electric fields are

353
00:24:16,228 --> 00:24:20,961
doing the work.
They accelerate the particles.

354
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,923
Magnetic fields can not
accelerate.

355
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:28,975
Magnetic fields can change the
direction but they can do no

356
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:33,505
work on the particles.
So the magnetic fields confine

357
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:37,164
the particles.
So let's assume we go twelve

358
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:40,474
hundred and twenty-five full
rotations.

359
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:44,916
During each rotation the
kinetic energy increased by

360
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,4
forty KEV.
And so if you multiply the two

361
00:24:48,4 --> 00:24:52,538
then
you see now that the kinetic

362
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:57,946
energy of this proton increased
by forty-nine million electron

363
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:02,557
volts, because it went
twelve-hundred and twenty-five

364
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:07,433
times all the way around,
and so now you have forty-nine

365
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:11,157
MEV plus the one MEV that you
started with,

366
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:14,172
so now you have a fifty MEV
proton.

367
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:19,314
You see the second line there?
There we have that fifty MEV

368
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:23,449
proton
that I discussed with you

369
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:26,848
earlier.
In a one Tesla field now the

370
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:31,665
radius is one meter,
so if this unit had a radius of

371
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:37,048
one meter that would be fine.
By that time it would be all

372
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:41,109
the way near the circumference
of this unit.

373
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:46,398
What is remarkable and not
intuitive, that the time to go

374
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:51,214
around as long as we don't have
to make relativistic

375
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:57,574
corrections,
that the time for a proton to

376
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:01,592
go around is independent of its
speed.

377
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:06,152
Not so intuitive,
and you can see this very

378
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:12,558
easily because the time to go
around  is two pi R divided by

379
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,033
its speed.
You see, the radius is

380
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:20,702
proportional to V.
And so the time itself is

381
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:27,373
independent of V,
because R itself is linearly

382
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:33,294
proportional with the speed and
so that cancels and so you'll

383
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:38,918
find now that the time to go
around is simply two pi times

384
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:42,766
the mass of that particle
divided by QB.

385
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:46,219
And if you correct
relativistically,

386
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:51,153
then you have to multiply by
gamma, but if you stay

387
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:55,593
non-relativistic,
then it's independent of the

388
00:26:55,593 --> 00:27:00,991
speed of the protons.
So if we stick to this

389
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:06,296
particular case of our one MEV
proton that became a fifty MEV

390
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:11,247
proton going around twelve
hundred and twenty-five times,

391
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:16,286
this time to go around once is
only sixty-six nanoseconds,

392
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:21,679
so this is six point six times
ten to the minus eight seconds.

393
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,188
Give you some feeling of how
fast all this is going.

394
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:30,255
So if you go around twelve
hundred

395
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:33,606
and twenty-five times,
that would take only eighty

396
00:27:33,606 --> 00:27:37,299
microseconds so in eighty
microseconds does all of this

397
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:41,539
occur and that means you have to
switch this field twice before

398
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,438
rotation, make sure that the
e-field is in this direction,

399
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:49,473
but when the proton comes here
the e-field has to be in that

400
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:52,209
direction.
And so the switching frequency

401
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:55,902
which easily be calculated
becomes about thirty million

402
00:27:55,902 --> 00:27:58,638
times per second,
about thirty megahertz.

403
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:04,533
And all of that takes place in
eighty microseconds and you

404
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:09,597
create one MEV protons,
you turn them into fifty MEV

405
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:12,775
protons.
A mind-boggling concept,

406
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,753
but it works.
Quite remarkable.

407
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:21,711
Now because of the relativistic
corrections that you see here

408
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:27,668
with gamma, if you go to very
high energies then the time  is

409
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:32,832
not constant for a full
rotation,

410
00:28:32,832 --> 00:28:37,892
so you have to adjust now the
frequency with which you switch

411
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:40,591
the potential between these
gaps.

412
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:45,652
So if the time increases then
this switching frequency has to

413
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:49,869
go down and we call those
instruments synchrotrons,

414
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,99
or synchrocyclotrons.
They have names.

415
00:28:52,99 --> 00:28:57,208
So you synchronize now and
correct for relativistic

416
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,907
effects.
Modern accelerators have

417
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:03,787
constant radii.
They are rings.

418
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:07,127
And so if you have a ring with
constant radius,

419
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:11,483
the only way that you can keep
the particles in the ring when

420
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:15,985
they have a low energy and when
they have the high energy is by

421
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:18,817
gradually increasing the
magnetic field.

422
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:21,94
So you start off with a weak
magnetic field,

423
00:29:21,94 --> 00:29:25,135
you go around huge circle,
very large radius,

424
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:29,273
and you gradually increase the
magnetic fields as you keep

425
00:29:29,273 --> 00:29:33,848
accelerating them and by making
the magnetic field go up just in

426
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:36,825
the right way,
maybe all the way up to two

427
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:41,236
Tesla,
you can keep them in that ring.

428
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:46,175
The first slide that I'd like
to show you is the slide of an

429
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:50,611
ancient cyclotron that is
actually a synchrocyclotron,

430
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:55,132
was built by Lawrence in
Berkeley, and this was capable

431
00:29:55,132 --> 00:29:59,401
of accelerating protons to seven
hundred thirty MEV.

432
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:04,172
You see here a person to give
you feeling for the size  of

433
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:07,772
this instrument.
Lawrence received the Nobel

434
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:12,292
Prize for Physics in 1939 for
his

435
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:17,713
invention of the cyclotron.
The next slide is Fermilab near

436
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:20,984
Chicago.
This is one of these modern

437
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:25,096
accelerators also called
sometimes colliders,

438
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:29,862
and this has a diameter of two
point two kilometers,

439
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:34,535
and this instrument,
this here, plans to accelerate

440
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:38,74
protons up to thousand GEV,
G stands for giga,

441
00:30:38,74 --> 00:30:44,16
giga is the same as billion.
A thousand giga electron volts

442
00:30:44,16 --> 00:30:48,203
would
be ten to the twelfth electron

443
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:50,377
volts.
The beams of high energy

444
00:30:50,377 --> 00:30:54,652
protons are made to collide with
other nuclei to uncover the

445
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,043
inner workings of nuclear
physics.

446
00:30:57,043 --> 00:31:00,956
The higher the energy of the
protons, the larger is the

447
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:05,159
impact when the protons collide
and the more one expects to

448
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,333
learn.
By using ever-increasing

449
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,956
energies of the protons,
which are nuclear bullets,

450
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:14,072
one explores unknown territory.
In the news,

451
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,694
these colliders are often
called

452
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:21,063
atom smashers.
That is a flashier name which

453
00:31:21,063 --> 00:31:25,372
appeals more to the general
public who pays for all this

454
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:29,447
with their tax money.
This research is a multibillion

455
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:32,737
dollar industry.
The words atom smasher are

456
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:36,341
actually a misnomer.
The colliders smash nuclei

457
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:40,023
which are ten thousand times
smaller than atoms.

458
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:44,567
And the next slide shows you
the tunnel of the largest ring

459
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:50,443
in the world which is in Geneva,
at CERN which is a European

460
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:53,921
collaboration.
This tunnel which already

461
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:59,002
exists for many years has a
confluence of seventeen miles,

462
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,836
has a radius of four point
three kilometers,

463
00:32:02,836 --> 00:32:08,275
and in here are these protons
being accelerated [inaudible] on

464
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:12,465
the high vacuum.
And with very modern techniques

465
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:18,082
of superconducting magnets they
can even go up now to about five

466
00:32:18,082 --> 00:32:21,291
Tesla.
And in this tunnel right now a

467
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:25,179
whole
new experiment is under

468
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:30,76
development which is called the
Large Hadron Collider which is

469
00:32:30,76 --> 00:32:35,975
considered the Holy Grail for
particle physicists and it's

470
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:41,282
hoped that that will go on the
air in the year Two Thousand

471
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:45,582
Seven or so and it will
accelerate protons to an

472
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:50,98
unprecedented energy that will
give them kinetic energies of

473
00:32:50,98 --> 00:32:55,463
seven thousand GEV,
seven times ten to the twelfth

474
00:32:55,463 --> 00:33:00,777
electron volts.
So I would like to return to my

475
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:04,382
overhead there,
so that you can see some of

476
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:09,017
that what we just discussed
right there, thank you Tom.

477
00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:13,652
So here we have Fermilab.
You see a radius of one point

478
00:33:13,652 --> 00:33:17,601
one kilometers.
I showed you a picture from the

479
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:21,635
air and so they went up to one
point five Tesla,

480
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:25,497
so that's the maximum magnetic
field strength.

481
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:31,163
Get very close to the speed of
light

482
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:35,862
by the way [laughter] and you
see five hundred GEV protons.

483
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:39,752
And here you see the holy
grail, the large hadron

484
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:43,803
collider, European collaboration
in Geneva at CERN,

485
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:48,017
whereby you have the
circumference of seventeen miles

486
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:52,879
and the magnetic fields that
they hope to achieve going up to

487
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:56,688
five and a half Tesla using
modern techniques of

488
00:33:56,688 --> 00:34:00,415
superconductors.
So if you want to go around in

489
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:06,363
those tunnels by the way,
by the way, you need a

490
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:10,947
motorcycle, [inaudible] go
seventeen miles around.

491
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:15,999
The goal of all this physics,
of all these experiments,

492
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:21,332
is to enter new territory,
to learn about these mysterious

493
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:26,945
nuclear forces and to see what
is insi- inside protons and to

494
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:32,465
see what is inside neutrons.
And with these experiments many

495
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:36,675
nuclear particles were
discovered

496
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:40,883
whose existence was completely
unknown previously.

497
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:45,606
Now comes the issue how can
you see the results of these

498
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:50,158
collisions of these particles
with very high energies.

499
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:54,967
Well, you can make the tracks
of these particles visible.

500
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:59,346
In fact, today you will see
them with your own eyes.

501
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:04,155
And in the old days this was
done with cloud chambers and

502
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:08,986
that's the
demonstration I will do today

503
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:11,828
for you.
But nowadays they do them with

504
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:14,969
bubble chambers.
Let's first understand the

505
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:17,96
principle.
If you had a charged particle,

506
00:35:17,96 --> 00:35:22,447
whether it is an electron or a
proton or an alpha particle --

507
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:26,709
alpha particle is the nucleus of
helium, it's two protons,

508
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:29,85
two neutrons.
If it goes through the air it

509
00:35:29,85 --> 00:35:33,814
makes ions and as it goes
through the air and it makes

510
00:35:33,814 --> 00:35:39,048
ions it slowly loses its kinetic
energy and it finally

511
00:35:39,048 --> 00:35:42,465
comes to a halt.
If we take a ten MEV electron

512
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:46,034
and one atmosphere air it could
go forty meters.

513
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:50,361
If you take a proton of ten MEV
it would only go one meter

514
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:54,917
because the density of ions is
higher because it has a higher

515
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:59,548
mass and if you take an alpha
particle which has a higher mass

516
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:03,496
than a proton and it has a
double charge of a proton,

517
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,305
then it would only go ten
centimeters.

518
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:10,101
It's a very high density track
that

519
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,613
you would get from an alpha
particle.

520
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:16,45
And so one way you could see
these tracks is using cloud

521
00:36:16,45 --> 00:36:20,566
chambers, and a cloud chamber
works in principle as follows.

522
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:24,334
You can just have a chamber in
air, one atmosphere air,

523
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:28,729
which you put liquid alcohol in
there, that's the way we will do

524
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:31,938
it, and you cool the bottom.
You see one there,

525
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:35,915
which you will see a little
later, and you cool the bottom

526
00:36:35,915 --> 00:36:39,682
with solid CO two and then you
get inside this chamber,

527
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:43,938
you get a temperature gradient
and there's a layer there where

528
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:47,599
the
alcohol should really condense

529
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,924
into little drops because it's
that cold, but for reasons that

530
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:54,902
are complicated it doesn't do it
quite yet.

531
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:57,171
We call that undercooled
alcohol.

532
00:36:57,171 --> 00:37:01,07
Even rain can be undercooled.
Just below freezing point,

533
00:37:01,07 --> 00:37:03,906
still liquid.
When the moment it hits the

534
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:06,671
ground it will immediately
become solid,

535
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:09,648
by the way.
That's also undercooled liquid.

536
00:37:09,648 --> 00:37:13,477
Now, here we deal with an
undercooled vapor and so when

537
00:37:13,477 --> 00:37:17,301
these
ions are made by these charged

538
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,81
particles, these ions act as
seeds for the drops,

539
00:37:20,81 --> 00:37:25,342
in this case the alcohol drops,
and you can literally with your

540
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:28,486
eyes, visually see these drops
being formed.

541
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:32,653
I'd like to go through one
numerical example and I want to

542
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:36,528
go to a five hundred KEV
electron which you see there.

543
00:37:36,528 --> 00:37:39,525
Um, notice that I have
corrected the speed

544
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:42,815
relativistically,
otherwise you would get this

545
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:46,617
ridiculous number that we
calculated

546
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:50,051
earlier which is larger than
the speed of light.

547
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:53,266
And suppose we have a
one-tenths Tesla field.

548
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:56,992
Then the radius would be two
point nine centimeters.

549
00:37:56,992 --> 00:38:01,376
But after a while this electron
will lose its energy and then

550
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:05,906
there comes a time that it has
only hundred kilo electron volts

551
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:07,221
left.
By that time,

552
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:11,167
the radius in a one-tenths
Tesla field would now be one

553
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:15,478
point one centimeters and so
when you look at cloud chambers

554
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:19,57
at the tracks of electrons and
you have

555
00:38:19,57 --> 00:38:24,193
magnets there,
you will see the tracks being

556
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:30,537
curled up which of course is the
result of the fact that the

557
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:36,773
radius gets smaller in time and
since the magnetic field is

558
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:43,332
constant you can see then large
radius here and as the kinetic

559
00:38:43,332 --> 00:38:49,568
energy slowly decreases the
radius gets smaller and smaller

560
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:54,36
and smaller.
So let's look at  a few more

561
00:38:54,36 --> 00:38:57,176
slides.
In 1932, Anderson noticed a

562
00:38:57,176 --> 00:39:01,648
track in a cloud chamber which
had the appearance of an

563
00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:04,216
electron.
It had the right mass,

564
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:08,771
it had the right charge,
but the curve- the direction of

565
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,994
curvature was wrong.
And so he concluded that it was

566
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:18,129
an electron which was positively
charged, which is now called a

567
00:39:18,129 --> 00:39:23,016
positron.
And these positrons had been

568
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:26,83
predicted on purely theoretical
grounds by Dirac,

569
00:39:26,83 --> 00:39:31,518
and Anderson receives a Nobel
Pri- [break in file] discovery

570
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:35,253
in Nineteen Thirty-Six,
only four years after he

571
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:39,782
discovered the positron and
Dirac had already received his

572
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:44,629
Nobel Prize in Nineteen Thirty
Three for his theoretical work.

573
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:48,602
The bubble chamber is an
advanced form of the cloud

574
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:50,986
chamber.
In the bubble chamber,

575
00:39:50,986 --> 00:39:54,88
liquid hydrogen is used and if
now

576
00:39:54,88 --> 00:39:59,591
the ions go through  the ions
become the seeds now for little

577
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:02,496
gas bubbles.
So you have liquids which

578
00:40:02,496 --> 00:40:07,129
really should have been gas but,
uh, not quite and so now it

579
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:10,27
forms gas bubbles.
So in a cloud chamber,

580
00:40:10,27 --> 00:40:14,197
you're going to see the drops.
In a bubble chamber,

581
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:17,652
you see gas bubbles but the
idea is the same,

582
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:22,363
and Glaser who invented these
chambers, is also from Berkeley

583
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:27,774
by the way,
he got a Nobel Prize for that

584
00:40:27,774 --> 00:40:32,442
in Nineteen Sixty.
So let's look at the discovery

585
00:40:32,442 --> 00:40:36,526
by Anderson.
Here you see a positron coming

586
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:42,165
from above,  and this positron
has sixty-three MEV  kinetic

587
00:40:42,165 --> 00:40:47,611
energy and Anderson put some
half a centimeter of lead in

588
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,986
there which was very clever,
think about that.

589
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:58,711
When it comes out,
the energy now is less,

590
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:03,208
because in the lead it produces
a lot of ions and so it loses a

591
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,835
lot of kinetic energy and it
comes out with roughly

592
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:09,737
twenty-three MEV.
And why did he do that?

593
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:13,871
Because now he knows for sure
that this particle came from

594
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:18,006
above, because when it loses
energy the radius is smaller.

595
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:21,85
That's why he was sure that it
was curved in the wrong

596
00:41:21,85 --> 00:41:24,534
direction.
If he didn't have the lead,

597
00:41:24,534 --> 00:41:28,233
you never know whether the
electron

598
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:31,304
came this way,
in which case the curvature

599
00:41:31,304 --> 00:41:34,825
would be perfect.
But now he knows it comes from

600
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:39,394
above and if this had been an
electron it would've curved this

601
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:41,715
way.
So this is one of the early

602
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:45,386
discovery, cloud chamber
photographed by Anderson.

603
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:49,73
And the next slide is a bubble
chamber and we see here both

604
00:41:49,73 --> 00:41:54,149
positron and an electron in a
constant magnetic field and it

605
00:41:54,149 --> 00:41:58,943
speaks for itself,
notice that the curvatures are

606
00:41:58,943 --> 00:42:03,111
exactly in opposite directions
and you see this spiral

607
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:07,987
structure that I discussed with
you as the electrons lose their

608
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:11,211
energy and since this is a
bubble chamber,

609
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:16,008
which has an enormous density a
thousand times higher density,

610
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:19,311
say, than air,
these electrons don't travel

611
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:23,165
forty meters in these chambers.
In air they would,

612
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:27,176
but in this case it is
substantially less and so you

613
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:30,872
can roll them up nicely.
And you can study them,

614
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:34,726
their momentum and their
charge.

615
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:39,735
Using  uh, accelerators and
cloud chambers and bubble

616
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:45,032
chambers, a whole new world  of
nuclear physics emerged.

617
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:47,344
Wow.
And between Nineteen

618
00:42:47,344 --> 00:42:52,642
Fifty-Eight and Sixty-Eight
thirty new nuclear particles

619
00:42:52,642 --> 00:42:57,073
were discovered.
And MIT has always been on the

620
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:04,78
forefront of this research.
Professor Sam King,

621
00:43:04,78 --> 00:43:08,488
who is still at MIT,
got the Nobel Prize in Nineteen

622
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:10,524
Seventy-Six.
Steven Weinberg,

623
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:14,741
a theoretician who did his work
while he was at MIT got his

624
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:17,359
Nobel Prize in Nineteen
Seventy-Nine.

625
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,395
Jerry Friedman,
still at MIT,

626
00:43:19,395 --> 00:43:22,812
and Henry Kendall,
got the Nobel Prize for their

627
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:26,448
work in Nineteen Ninety.
And Clifford Shull got his

628
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:28,993
Nobel Prize in Nineteen
Ninety-Four.

629
00:43:28,993 --> 00:43:33,283
If I summarize the basic idea
behind it, it is very relevant

630
00:43:33,283 --> 00:43:38,081
to eight oh two,
you accelerate these particles

631
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:41,477
using electric fields.
That's the only way you can

632
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:44,456
accelerate them.
Magnetic fields can only be

633
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:48,059
used to confine them.
It can not change their kinetic

634
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,8
energy but kinetic electr-
magnetic fields are crucial,

635
00:43:51,8 --> 00:43:55,957
because that allows you as you
gradually increase their speed

636
00:43:55,957 --> 00:43:58,244
to confine them,
either by a ring,

637
00:43:58,244 --> 00:44:01,708
which is done nowadays,
or in the old days in these

638
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:04,965
chambers of the cyclotrons and
the synchrotrons.

639
00:44:04,965 --> 00:44:08,845
And then we have the bubble
chambers, in the old days the

640
00:44:08,845 --> 00:44:13,542
cloud chambers,
whereby you use magnetic fields

641
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:18,224
to get information on the radius
of these particles as they are

642
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:21,623
being detected.
And out of all these emerged a

643
00:44:21,623 --> 00:44:26,23
whole new way of looking at our
world and completely new ideas

644
00:44:26,23 --> 00:44:30,61
about what makes the world tick.
This is nothing short of a

645
00:44:30,61 --> 00:44:33,782
revolution.
And so now I want to enjoy with

646
00:44:33,782 --> 00:44:38,012
you the last five minutes of
this lecture by looking at a

647
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:43,158
cloud chamber and by looking at
some of these tracks.

648
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:47,069
You're going to see a lot of
electrons in there.

649
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:51,978
The walls of the cloud chamber
are radioactive just like you

650
00:44:51,978 --> 00:44:55,556
are radioactive.
Your bones are radioactive,

651
00:44:55,556 --> 00:44:59,633
your windows are radioactive.
They emit electrons.

652
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:03,377
No protons, but they certainly
emit electrons.

653
00:45:03,377 --> 00:45:06,872
And we have in there a
radioactive isotope,

654
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:11,032
a rod, which has thorium in it
which

655
00:45:11,032 --> 00:45:14,582
produces alpha particles.
And so you're going to see

656
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:18,201
electrons which make beautiful
spider web structures.

657
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:21,611
Please don't clean up yet,
we have plenty of time.

658
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:24,255
To be precise,
we have five minutes and

659
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:27,108
eighteen seconds left.
So these electrons,

660
00:45:27,108 --> 00:45:31,284
you will see them going like
spiders through this chamber and

661
00:45:31,284 --> 00:45:35,042
sometimes they change abrupt
direction because they can

662
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:39,218
collide, particularly when they
have low energy and then they

663
00:45:39,218 --> 00:45:42,237
[break in file]
so to speak,

664
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:45,937
and then occasionally we may
see an alpha particle coming

665
00:45:45,937 --> 00:45:50,032
from our radioactive thorium and
that makes a very thick track.

666
00:45:50,032 --> 00:45:53,534
And so let's try this.
We have an expert here which is

667
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:56,837
Marcos who has not only borrowed
these instruments,

668
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,545
and if you like it we may
actually buy it,

669
00:45:59,545 --> 00:46:01,461
it's not cheap,
we may buy it,

670
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:05,094
but he borrowed it specially
for you, for which I'm very

671
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:08,199
grateful, Marcos,
and he also did quite a bit of

672
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,313
work to get the light just
right.

673
00:46:10,313 --> 00:46:14,374
It's not too easy to
see those tracks.

674
00:46:14,374 --> 00:46:18,963
So Marcos, you will get a
chance to adjust the lights if

675
00:46:18,963 --> 00:46:20,381
you want that.
Um.

676
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:24,887
We're going to make it very
dark  and let's enjoy them,

677
00:46:24,887 --> 00:46:27,974
this wonderful world,
invisible world,

678
00:46:27,974 --> 00:46:31,979
of nuclear physics.
So here you see this  th- the

679
00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:37,236
rod with thorium  so Marcos feel
free to adjust the light if you

680
00:46:37,236 --> 00:46:40,907
feel the need.
I will go into the audience as

681
00:46:40,907 --> 00:46:46,746
well
and see whether  we can

682
00:46:46,746 --> 00:46:50,17
identify the electrons.
Oh, there was an alpha

683
00:46:50,17 --> 00:46:53,138
particle.
So this is this rod and so the

684
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:56,942
bottom of this chamber is cooled
with solid CO two.

685
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:59,682
Ah, there was an electron,
very nice.

686
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:03,334
As I said, you know,
they almost look like spider

687
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:05,769
webs.
There was an electron here.

688
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:10,259
Also keep an eye on this rod
and occasionally you will see a

689
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:14,368
very dense track which then
indicates -- there was one,

690
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:18,017
that's an alpha
particle.

691
00:47:18,017 --> 00:47:20,302
There's a beautiful alpha
particle.

692
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:23,328
Just enjoy this.
You know, you're looking at a

693
00:47:23,328 --> 00:47:26,353
world which is completely new.
Think about it.

694
00:47:26,353 --> 00:47:29,445
You're looking at the world of
nuclear physics.

695
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:33,076
You're seeing individual
electrons and occasionally you

696
00:47:33,076 --> 00:47:36,37
see alpha particles.
Here, there's one coming out.

697
00:47:36,37 --> 00:47:39,597
And think about the physics
what's going on here,

698
00:47:39,597 --> 00:47:43,698
this alcohol which refuses to
become drops and then these ions

699
00:47:43,698 --> 00:47:49,126
say we force you to become uh --
here's an alpha particle,

700
00:47:49,126 --> 00:47:51,937
I don't know what it's doing
there.

701
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:55,492
So these, these,
um, these ions force these,

702
00:47:55,492 --> 00:47:59,129
um, these, this,
this alcohol vapor to become

703
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:01,361
drops.
That's an incredible,

704
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:04,503
complex picture that you're
looking at.

705
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:07,396
It is amazing every time I see
this.

706
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:11,612
It's absolutely fabulous.
And all through these very

707
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:14,257
simple rules,
now think about it,

708
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:20,458
we have the Lawrence force,
that  makes these particles go

709
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:25,335
around, electric fields that you
can use them to  accelerate

710
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:30,378
them, and then this subtle way
that you can actually make them

711
00:48:30,378 --> 00:48:33,437
visible, individual particles
visible.

712
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:37,405
It is a new world.
And the goal of my lecture was

713
00:48:37,405 --> 00:48:42,365
to make you peek into this world
which has revolutionized our

714
00:48:42,365 --> 48:47
whole way of thinking.
Thank you.
