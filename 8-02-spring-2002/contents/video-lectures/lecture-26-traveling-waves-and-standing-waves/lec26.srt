1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
So today, I will start with a
general discussion on waves,

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
as an introduction to
electromagnetic waves,

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
which we will discuss next
week.

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
We'll start with a very
down-to-earth equation,

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:25
Y equals one-third X.
And I'm going to plot that for

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:30
you, so here is Y and here is X,
and that's a straight line

7
00:00:30 --> 00:00:36
through the origin,
Y equals one-third X.

8
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
Suppose, now,
I want this line to move.

9
00:00:40 --> 00:00:46
I want this line to move with a
speed of 6 meters per second

10
00:00:46 --> 00:00:52
in the plus X direction.
All I will have to do now is to

11
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
replace X in that equation 
by X - 6T.

12
00:00:55 --> 00:01:01
Notice the minus sign.
I will go, then,

13
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
in the plus X direction.
The equation then becomes Y

14
00:01:04 --> 00:01:10
equals one-third times X - 6T.

15
00:01:08 --> 00:01:14
So look at it at T equals 1.
At T equals 0,

16
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
you already have the line.
At T equals 1,

17
00:01:19 --> 00:01:25
you now have Y equals 1/3
X - 2.

18
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
That means, here it will
intersect at - 2,

19
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
and there it will intersect at
+ 6, and the line parallel

20
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
to the first one,
this line is now T = 1,

21
00:01:42 --> 00:01:48
and this is T = 0.
And it has moved in this

22
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
direction, with a speed of 6
meters per second.

23
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
And so what this is telling us,
that if we ever want something

24
00:01:57 --> 00:02:03
to move with a speed V in the
plus X direction,

25
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
then all we have to do in our
equations to replace X by X

26
00:02:07 --> 00:02:13
- VT, and if we want it to
move in the minus X direction,

27
00:02:14 --> 00:02:20
then we replace X by X + VT.

28
00:02:18 --> 00:02:24
That's all we have to do.
So now, I'm going to change to

29
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
something that is a real wave.
I now have Y = 2,

30
00:02:31 --> 00:02:37
times the sin 3X.
That's a wave.

31
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
It's not moving,
not yet.

32
00:02:38 --> 00:02:44
So I can make a plot of Y as a
function of X,

33
00:02:44 --> 00:02:50
and that plot will be like
this.

34
00:02:49 --> 00:02:55
This is zero,
so when the sine is zero,

35
00:02:54 --> 00:03:00
this is pi divided by 3,
and this is

36
00:03:00 --> 00:03:06
degrees, and it's again zero,
this is 2 pi divided by

37
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
3, it's again zero.
And lambda, which we call the

38
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18
wavelength, lambda,
in this case,

39
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
is from here to here,
that is 2 pi divided by

40
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
3,
this goes also from here to

41
00:03:25 --> 00:03:31
there.
I will introduce a symbol K

42
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
that you will often see,
we call that the wave number,

43
00:03:33 --> 00:03:39
and K is simply defined as 2
pi divided by lambda.

44
00:03:38 --> 00:03:44
So in our specific case,
K is 3.

45
00:03:41 --> 00:03:47
This here is K.
If you know this number,

46
00:03:45 --> 00:03:51
you can immediately tell what
the wavelength is.

47
00:03:49 --> 00:03:55
Now, I want to have this wave
move.

48
00:03:52 --> 00:03:58
I want to have a traveling
wave.

49
00:03:57 --> 00:04:03
And I want to have it move with
6 meters per second in the

50
00:04:02 --> 00:04:08
plus X direction.
So the recipe is now very

51
00:04:06 --> 00:04:12
simple, all I have to do replace
this X by X - 6T.

52
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
So now I get Y equals 2 sin 
[3(X-6T)].

53
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
And if you now look at this

54
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
curve, this equation,
and you plot it a little bit

55
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
later in time than T0
-- this is already T0 -- a

56
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
little later in time,
you will see that,

57
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
indeed, it has moved in the
plus X direction.

58
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
And it's moving with a speed of
6 meters per second.

59
00:04:43 --> 00:04:49
So this equation,
when you look at it,

60
00:04:46 --> 00:04:52
holds all the characteristics
of the oscillation.

61
00:04:50 --> 00:04:56
It holds the amplitude.
This 2 is the amplitude.

62
00:04:54 --> 00:05:00
This is - 2,
that's the amplitude.

63
00:04:59 --> 00:05:05
This information,
K, holds the information on the

64
00:05:02 --> 00:05:08
wavelength, and this information
tells you what the speed is.

65
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
And the minus sign,
which is important,

66
00:05:10 --> 00:05:16
tells you that it's going in
the plus X direction,

67
00:05:14 --> 00:05:20
and not in the minus X
direction.

68
00:05:17 --> 00:05:23
Can we make such a traveling
wave?

69
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
Yes, we can do that,
actually, quite easily.

70
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
Suppose I have here a rotating
wheel -- rotate with angular

71
00:05:27 --> 00:05:33
frequency omega,
and let this has a radius R,

72
00:05:32 --> 00:05:38
and I give it 2 units,
so that I get the same

73
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
amplitude that I have here.
And I attach to this a string,

74
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
and I put some tension on the
string, so that I create a wave

75
00:05:46 --> 00:05:52
as I rotate it,
and the string is attached

76
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
here, and as it rotates,
the wave is going to propagate

77
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
into the string with a velocity,
let's say, V.

78
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
So I can generate a traveling
wave.

79
00:06:02 --> 00:06:08
The period of one oscillation
-- if you were here on the

80
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
string, you're going up,
you're going down,

81
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
you're going up,
you're going down,

82
00:06:13 --> 00:06:19
that's all you're doing,
when the wave passes by -- the

83
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
period of one whole oscillation
is obviously 2 pi divided by

84
00:06:22 --> 00:06:28
this omega.
The wavelength lambda that you

85
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
are creating -- from here to
here is lambda -- well,

86
00:06:30 --> 00:06:36
if you know the speed with
which it is traveling,

87
00:06:35 --> 00:06:41
and you know it has been
traveling capital T seconds,

88
00:06:40 --> 00:06:46
one oscillation,
that's a distance lambda.

89
00:06:44 --> 00:06:50
So this is V times T.
But this is also V divided by

90
00:06:49 --> 00:06:55
F, if F is the frequency in
Hertz.

91
00:06:52 --> 00:06:58
And so the frequency F is then
also given by the speed divided

92
00:06:58 --> 00:07:04
by lambda.
And so I can write down this

93
00:07:01 --> 00:07:07
equation now in a somewhat
different form,

94
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
Y equals 2 times the sine,
and now I bring the 3

95
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
inside, so I get 3X-18T.

96
00:07:16 --> 00:07:22
This 18 is now that
omega.

97
00:07:19 --> 00:07:25
This is omega T.
In here is all the timing

98
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
information.
Omega, the period T,

99
00:07:26 --> 00:07:32
everything is in here.
Here is all the spatial

100
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
information.
This is K.

101
00:07:33 --> 00:07:39
In here is the information
about lambda.

102
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
And so if I know omega,
and I know K,

103
00:07:42 --> 00:07:48
then I can also find the
velocity, which is omega divided

104
00:07:46 --> 00:07:52
by K.
So everything is in here,

105
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
omega divided by 3 gives me
back my 6 meters per second.

106
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
So once you have the equation,
I can ask you any question

107
00:07:57 --> 00:08:03
about that wave,
and you should be able,

108
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
then, to answer.
Wavelength,

109
00:08:02 --> 00:08:08
frequency, in hertz,
in radians per second,

110
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
speed, everything.
You may ask me now,

111
00:08:08 --> 00:08:14
"Why do you discuss this with
us?"

112
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
Well, we are coming up to
electromagnetic waves next

113
00:08:15 --> 00:08:21
week, and electromagnetic waves,
you're going to see lambdas,

114
00:08:19 --> 00:08:25
you're going to see omegas,
you're going to see capital Ts,

115
00:08:23 --> 00:08:29
you're going to see frequency,
you're going to see Ks,

116
00:08:26 --> 00:08:32
everything you see there you're
going to see next week.

117
00:08:29 --> 00:08:35
One exception,
that Y, the displacement Y,

118
00:08:32 --> 00:08:38
will not be in centimeters or
meters, but it will be an

119
00:08:35 --> 00:08:41
electric field,
a traveling electric field,

120
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
volts per meter.
Or a traveling magnetic field,

121
00:08:41 --> 00:08:47
tesla.
But other than that,

122
00:08:42 --> 00:08:48
all these quantities will
return in exactly the same way.

123
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
Now I want to discuss with you
a standing wave first,

124
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
because standing waves are
going to be important.

125
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
This is a traveling wave.
And now comes something even

126
00:09:03 --> 00:09:09
more intriguing,
which is a standing wave.

127
00:09:07 --> 00:09:13
Suppose I have a wave traveling
in this direction,

128
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
and I call that Y1,
and Y0 is the amplitude,

129
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
sine (K X - omega T).
And notice now,

130
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
I have all the symbols that we
are familiar with.

131
00:09:25 --> 00:09:31
We have the K here,
we have the omega here,

132
00:09:28 --> 00:09:34
and we have the amplitude here.
And the minus sign tells me,

133
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
[wssshhht], it's going in the
plus direction.

134
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
But I have another wave.
And the wave is exactly

135
00:09:38 --> 00:09:44
identical, in terms of
amplitude, in terms of

136
00:09:41 --> 00:09:47
wavelength, in terms of
frequency, identical,

137
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
but it's traveling in this
direction.

138
00:09:46 --> 00:09:52
And so this is Y2,
which is Y0 sine (KX + omega T).

139
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
This plus sign tells me it's
going in this direction.

140
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
And so if this is a string,
the net result is the sum of

141
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
the two.
So I have to add them up.

142
00:10:05 --> 00:10:11
So Y = Y1 + Y2.
So I have to do some trigono-

143
00:10:09 --> 00:10:15
trigonometric manipulation,
and this is what I leave --

144
00:10:14 --> 00:10:20
I'll leave you with that,
that's high school stuff -- you

145
00:10:19 --> 00:10:25
add the two up and you'll find
2 Y0--

146
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
notice that the amplitude has
doubled -- times the sine (K X)

147
00:10:29 --> 00:10:35
times cosine (omega T).
That's the sum of those two.

148
00:10:34 --> 00:10:40
And this is very,
very different from a traveling

149
00:10:37 --> 00:10:43
wave.
Nowhere will you see K X -

150
00:10:40 --> 00:10:46
omega T any more.
K X is here,

151
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
separate under the sine,
and omega T is separate under

152
00:10:46 --> 00:10:52
the cosine.
All the timing information is

153
00:10:50 --> 00:10:56
now separate from the spatial
information.

154
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
And so what does a standing
wave like this look like?

155
00:10:59 --> 00:11:05
Well, let's -- a bracket here.
Let's make a drawing of such a

156
00:11:05 --> 00:11:11
standing wave.
So here we have Y,

157
00:11:09 --> 00:11:15
and here we have X.
Let's only look at the sine K X

158
00:11:14 --> 00:11:20
for now.
If X is 0,

159
00:11:16 --> 00:11:22
the sine is always 0,
so this point will never move.

160
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
But if K X is
degrees, it's also 0,

161
00:11:28 --> 00:11:34
always.
So lambda over two will never

162
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37
move.
X is lambda,

163
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
when this is 360 degrees,

164
00:11:36 --> 00:11:42
it will never move.
- lambda / 2,

165
00:11:40 --> 00:11:46
will never move.
So what will it look like?

166
00:11:43 --> 00:11:49
Well, you're going to see
something like this,

167
00:11:47 --> 00:11:53
let's take the moment when T
equals 0, so when cosine

168
00:11:52 --> 00:11:58
omega T is plus
1.

169
00:11:55 --> 00:12:01
So we're going to have a curve
like this, so this goes up to

170
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
2Y0 like this -- and
this here is then my 2Y0.

171
00:12:06 --> 00:12:12
These points will never move,
they will always stand still.

172
00:12:12 --> 00:12:18
There's nothing like a
traveling wave.

173
00:12:15 --> 00:12:21
If it's a traveling wave,
these points will see the wave

174
00:12:21 --> 00:12:27
go by, they will go up and down,
they never do that.

175
00:12:27 --> 00:12:33
They sit still.
They have a name.

176
00:12:29 --> 00:12:35
We call them nodes.
Let's now look at little later.

177
00:12:33 --> 00:12:39
Let's look at T equals one
quarter of a period.

178
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
Now, the cosine is 0.
So there's not a single point

179
00:12:41 --> 00:12:47
on the string that is not 0.
So the string looks like this.

180
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
If you took a picture of the
string, you wouldn't even know

181
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
it's oscillating.
It would be just a straight

182
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
line.
And now, if we do -- look a

183
00:12:56 --> 00:13:02
little
later, and we look at T equals

184
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
one-half the period,
then the cosine is -1.

185
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
So now the curve will look like
this.

186
00:13:05 --> 00:13:11
And so what does it mean?
If we just look what's here

187
00:13:09 --> 00:13:15
happening, this is what's going
to happen.

188
00:13:12 --> 00:13:18
The string is just doing this,
and there are points that stand

189
00:13:16 --> 00:13:22
still.
Nothing is going like this,

190
00:13:18 --> 00:13:24
nothing is going like this.
You see this point going up and

191
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
down, up and down,
up and down,

192
00:13:24 --> 00:13:30
and this will do the same,
and these nodes will do

193
00:13:28 --> 00:13:34
nothing.
So that is what a standing wave

194
00:13:32 --> 00:13:38
will look like,
and I think the name standing

195
00:13:35 --> 00:13:41
wave is a very appropriate name,
very descriptive,

196
00:13:39 --> 00:13:45
because it's really standing,
it's not -- it's not moving.

197
00:13:44 --> 00:13:50
At least, not traveling along
the X direction.

198
00:13:47 --> 00:13:53
Can we make a standing wave?
Yes, we can,

199
00:13:50 --> 00:13:56
and I will do that today.
A standing wave can be made by

200
00:13:55 --> 00:14:01
shaking -- or rotating,
in that fashion -- a string.

201
00:13:59 --> 00:14:05
So here I have a string,
I -- say I attach the string to

202
00:14:04 --> 00:14:10
the wall there,
and I move it up and down here.

203
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
So a wave goes in -- I do just
this, like the rotating disc --

204
00:14:11 --> 00:14:17
the wave travels,
but the wave is reflected,

205
00:14:14 --> 00:14:20
and so I have a wave going in
and I have a wave coming back,

206
00:14:18 --> 00:14:24
so I have now two waves going
through each other.

207
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
And if the conditions are just
right, then these reflective

208
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
waves -- this one will reflect,
when it arrives here,

209
00:14:28 --> 00:14:34
it will reflect again,
it goes back again,

210
00:14:31 --> 00:14:37
and it will continue to reflect
--

211
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
so if the conditions are just
right, then these reflective

212
00:14:39 --> 00:14:45
waves will support each other,
and they will generate a large

213
00:14:43 --> 00:14:49
amplitude -- as I will
demonstrate to you -- but that's

214
00:14:47 --> 00:14:53
only the case for very specific
frequencies, and we call those

215
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
resonance frequencies.
The lowest possible frequency

216
00:14:55 --> 00:15:01
for which this happens -- which
we call the fundamental -- will

217
00:15:00 --> 00:15:06
make the string vibrate like
this.

218
00:15:02 --> 00:15:08
So the whole thing goes.
[wssshhht],

219
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
[wssshhht], [wssshhht],
and we call that the

220
00:15:10 --> 00:15:16
fundamental.
We call that also the first

221
00:15:13 --> 00:15:19
harmonic.
If now I increase the

222
00:15:16 --> 00:15:22
frequencies, then I get a second
resonant frequency,

223
00:15:21 --> 00:15:27
and a node jumps in the middle
-- there is already a node here,

224
00:15:26 --> 00:15:32
and there is a node here,
because this motion of my hand

225
00:15:31 --> 00:15:37
here is very small,
as I will demonstrate to you,

226
00:15:37 --> 00:15:43
for all practical purpose you
can think of this being a node

227
00:15:41 --> 00:15:47
-- and so now the string in the
second harmonic will oscillate

228
00:15:46 --> 00:15:52
like this.
[Wssshhht], [wssshhht],

229
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
[wssshhht], [wssshhht],
so this is the second harmonic.

230
00:15:53 --> 00:15:59
And if we go up in frequencies,
then -- this should be right in

231
00:15:58 --> 00:16:04
the middle, by the way -- and if
I go up in frequency one step

232
00:16:02 --> 00:16:08
more, then I get another
resonance whereby we get an

233
00:16:06 --> 00:16:12
extra node, and so we get the
third harmonic,

234
00:16:11 --> 00:16:17
and you just can go on like
that.

235
00:16:14 --> 00:16:20
You get a whole series of
resonance frequencies.

236
00:16:18 --> 00:16:24
And so, for the fundamental,
lambda 1 -- the 1 refers to

237
00:16:23 --> 00:16:29
the first harmonic -- is 2L,
if L is the length of my

238
00:16:28 --> 00:16:34
string.
This is L.

239
00:16:30 --> 00:16:36
You only have half a wavelength
here, so L is 2L.

240
00:16:35 --> 00:16:41
But we know that the frequency
is the velocity divided by the

241
00:16:41 --> 00:16:47
wavelength -- we see that
there, frequency is velocity

242
00:16:46 --> 00:16:52
divided by the wavelength -- so
the frequency F1 is the

243
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
velocity divided by lambda 1,
so that's divided by 2L.

244
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
So that's the frequency in the
fundamental for which this

245
00:17:00 --> 00:17:06
resonance phenomenon occurs.
For the second harmonic,

246
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
lambda 2 equals L.
You can tell,

247
00:17:07 --> 00:17:13
you see a complete wavelength
here.

248
00:17:10 --> 00:17:16
And F2, that frequency,
is going to be twice F1.

249
00:17:16 --> 00:17:22
And F3 is going to be
3 F1.

250
00:17:21 --> 00:17:27
And if you want to know,
for the Nth harmonic,

251
00:17:26 --> 00:17:32
N being Nancy,
then lambda of N equals N -- 2L/N.

252
00:17:31 --> 00:17:37
Substitute in N1,

253
00:17:34 --> 00:17:40
and you find the wavelength for
the first harmonic.

254
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
Substitute for N2,
and you find the wavelength for

255
00:17:45 --> 00:17:51
the second
harmonic.

256
00:17:48 --> 00:17:54
And so on.
And the frequency for the Nth

257
00:17:51 --> 00:17:57
harmonic -- N stands for Nancy
-- is N times V divided by 

258
00:17:56 --> 00:18:02
2L.
So here you see the entire

259
00:17:58 --> 00:18:04
series of frequencies and
wavelengths for which we have

260
00:18:02 --> 00:18:08
resonance.
Unlike in our LRC system that

261
00:18:05 --> 00:18:11
we discussed last time,
where you had one resonance

262
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
frequency, now you have an
infinite number of resonance

263
00:18:13 --> 00:18:19
frequencies, and they are at
very discrete values,

264
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
equally spaced.
I want to demonstrate this to

265
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
you with a violin string,
it's a very special violin

266
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
string, it's here on the floor,
it's a biggie,

267
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
and I need some help from
someone.

268
00:18:29 --> 00:18:35
You helped me before,
would you mind helping me

269
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
again?
So here is, uh,

270
00:18:34 --> 00:18:40
one end of the string,
which you're going to hold,

271
00:18:37 --> 00:18:43
you're going to be a node,
believe it or not.

272
00:18:40 --> 00:18:46
Hold it better,
two hands -- no,

273
00:18:42 --> 00:18:48
much better.
You will see shortly,

274
00:18:44 --> 00:18:50
why -- no, no,
no, much better.

275
00:18:48 --> 00:18:54
That's it.
And walk back a little,

276
00:18:50 --> 00:18:56
walk further.
Yes, that's good,

277
00:18:52 --> 00:18:58
hold it.
I will put on a white glove,

278
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
and there is a reason for that,
because I want you to be able

279
00:18:58 --> 00:19:04
to see my hand when we're going
to make it dark,

280
00:19:01 --> 00:19:07
so that you will convince
yourself that my hand,

281
00:19:04 --> 00:19:10
which is generating the wave,
is hardly moving at all.

282
00:19:08 --> 00:19:14
For practical purposes,
it's a node,

283
00:19:10 --> 00:19:16
and yet we get these wonderful
resonance phenomenon.

284
00:19:13 --> 00:19:19
So I'm going to make it very
dark so that the UV will do its

285
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
job, and you can see
the string better,

286
00:19:21 --> 00:19:27
that's the only way we can make
you see the string well.

287
00:19:24 --> 00:19:30
All right.
Don't let go,

288
00:19:26 --> 00:19:32
er- under any circumstances,
you will hurt me if you do

289
00:19:29 --> 00:19:35
that.
Of course, if I let go first,

290
00:19:31 --> 00:19:37
then [pfft],
I will hurt you,

291
00:19:33 --> 00:19:39
but that's not my plan.
OK, so let's try to go a little

292
00:19:37 --> 00:19:43
bit further back.
Let's try to,

293
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
uh, find, first the -- the
fundamental.

294
00:19:41 --> 00:19:47
And I'll try to find it by
exciting just the right

295
00:19:44 --> 00:19:50
frequency with my hand.
There it is.

296
00:19:47 --> 00:19:53
I think I got it.
That's the fundamental.

297
00:19:51 --> 00:19:57
And look how little my hand is
moving here.

298
00:19:54 --> 00:20:00
And you will see a very large
amplitude in the middle.

299
00:19:57 --> 00:20:03
And so these reflected waves,
one runs to him,

300
00:20:01 --> 00:20:07
it runs back at me,
it runs back at him,

301
00:20:03 --> 00:20:09
keeps reflecting many times,
they support each other in a

302
00:20:07 --> 00:20:13
constructive way,
that's what resonance is all

303
00:20:10 --> 00:20:16
about.
And now I'll try to find the

304
00:20:13 --> 00:20:19
second harmonic -- so you'll see
another node coming in at the

305
00:20:17 --> 00:20:23
middle.
It's easier for you to see than

306
00:20:20 --> 00:20:26
for me, actually.
And it's not always easy

307
00:20:24 --> 00:20:30
to find the -- no,
no, no, I'm too low frequency,

308
00:20:28 --> 00:20:34
I have to go up.
I think I got it now.

309
00:20:31 --> 00:20:37
Is this it?
Yes, one extra node in the

310
00:20:34 --> 00:20:40
middle?
Speak out up,

311
00:20:35 --> 00:20:41
please.
[chorus of agreement] Ah,

312
00:20:38 --> 00:20:44
that's better.
Now I can hear you,

313
00:20:40 --> 00:20:46
thank you.
Um, there are three nodes now.

314
00:20:43 --> 00:20:49
My friend there is a node,
I'm a node, and then there is

315
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
one in the middle.
If you subtract 1,

316
00:20:50 --> 00:20:56
the 3-1 is 2,
then it's the second harmonic.

317
00:20:56 --> 00:21:02
And so now I will try to
generate a very high frequency,

318
00:21:01 --> 00:21:07
in resonance,
and then you count the number

319
00:21:05 --> 00:21:11
of nodes, subtract one,
and then you know which

320
00:21:09 --> 00:21:15
harmonic I was able to generate.
But I will try to -- not so

321
00:21:14 --> 00:21:20
easy to get a resonance in
there.

322
00:21:17 --> 00:21:23
No, I'm off resonance.
No.

323
00:21:20 --> 00:21:26
.
Yeah!

324
00:21:20 --> 00:21:26
Yeah!
Yeah!

325
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
Yeah!
Yeah!

326
00:21:22 --> 00:21:28
Yeah!
Yeah!

327
00:21:23 --> 00:21:29
[laughter] Got it,
got it, got it!

328
00:21:28 --> 00:21:34
Got it!
You keep counting.

329
00:21:30 --> 00:21:36
Keep counting.
Oh, that's a super-high

330
00:21:33 --> 00:21:39
harmonic!
[crowd responds] How many did

331
00:21:36 --> 00:21:42
you count?
[crowd responds] 10,

332
00:21:39 --> 00:21:45
do I hear 10?
[crowd responds] Do I hear

333
00:21:42 --> 00:21:48
20?
[laughter] Actually,

334
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
I counted about 27,
but that's OK.

335
00:21:48 --> 00:21:54
[laughter].
All right, thank you very much,

336
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
it was great that you helped
me.

337
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
[applause].
So that's, uh,

338
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04
standing waves.
And you see the shapes,

339
00:22:01 --> 00:22:07
and you saw the,
the mode of operation,

340
00:22:04 --> 00:22:10
very characteristic for
standing waves.

341
00:22:07 --> 00:22:13
When I pluck a string,
of a violin,

342
00:22:10 --> 00:22:16
or I strike it with a bow,
or with a hammer,

343
00:22:13 --> 00:22:19
on a piano, just a hammer comes
down, that is exposing the

344
00:22:18 --> 00:22:24
string to a whole set of
frequencies.

345
00:22:21 --> 00:22:27
And so the string,
now, decides which frequencies

346
00:22:25 --> 00:22:31
it like to oscillate in.
And so it selects these

347
00:22:30 --> 00:22:36
resonance frequencies.
And so if the string has a

348
00:22:33 --> 00:22:39
fundamental of
hertz, then it would start to

349
00:22:37 --> 00:22:43
resonate at 400,
but simultaneously,

350
00:22:40 --> 00:22:46
it will be very happy with
800 hertz,

351
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
and with 1200 hertz.
And so the string will

352
00:22:47 --> 00:22:53
simultaneously -- if I bang it,
or strike it,

353
00:22:50 --> 00:22:56
or pluck it -- simultaneously
oscillate, often at more than

354
00:22:54 --> 00:23:00
one frequency.
Fundamental,

355
00:22:56 --> 00:23:02
and several of the higher
harmonics.

356
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
And all the others that are
present, all the other

357
00:23:04 --> 00:23:10
frequencies in this  striking
with the bow,

358
00:23:08 --> 00:23:14
I ignore, they're off
resonance.

359
00:23:10 --> 00:23:16
So if you design a string
instrument, then this is really

360
00:23:15 --> 00:23:21
a key equation.
If you want a particular

361
00:23:18 --> 00:23:24
fundamental -- say your
fundamental is

362
00:23:23 --> 00:23:29
and this is a given
number.

363
00:23:25 --> 00:23:31
And so N is 1.
You can now manipulate V,

364
00:23:31 --> 00:23:37
because V depends on the
tension on the string,

365
00:23:34 --> 00:23:40
and it depends on what kind of
string you have.

366
00:23:38 --> 00:23:44
The speed in the string is the
square root of the tension -- if

367
00:23:43 --> 00:23:49
you take 8.03,
you will even see a proof for

368
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
that -- divided by the mass of
the string per unit length of

369
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
the string.
So you take four strings for a

370
00:23:54 --> 00:24:00
violin -- six for a guitar --
and you make them out of very

371
00:23:59 --> 00:24:05
different material --
different mass per unit length

372
00:24:04 --> 00:24:10
-- and so that gives you,
then, difference velocities --

373
00:24:07 --> 00:24:13
you can also fool around with
the tension -- and so the four

374
00:24:10 --> 00:24:16
strings, then,
have all four different

375
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
fundamental.
In the violin,

376
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
they may have the same length.
What are going to do now to

377
00:24:18 --> 00:24:24
play the violin?
All that is left over is L,

378
00:24:20 --> 00:24:26
that's the only thing you can
change, and that's what a

379
00:24:23 --> 00:24:29
violinist is doing.
Goes with the finger,

380
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
back and forth over the
strings, make them shorter,

381
00:24:29 --> 00:24:35
pitch goes up,
frequency goes up,

382
00:24:31 --> 00:24:37
makes them longer,
frequency goes down.

383
00:24:34 --> 00:24:40
And you do the same with a
guitar, and you do the same with

384
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
a bass and a cello.
So when you're playing,

385
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
what you're doing all the time
is changing L so that you get

386
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
all these frequencies that you
want to produce.

387
00:24:47 --> 00:24:53
If you take your instrument out
of the closet,

388
00:24:49 --> 00:24:55
you may have noticed that it's
really not in tune anymore,

389
00:24:53 --> 00:24:59
it's slightly off-tune.
Well, what you can do now,

390
00:24:56 --> 00:25:02
you can change V a little bit
-- uh, these little knobs -- and

391
00:24:59 --> 00:25:05
you can change the tension in
the strings.

392
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
And that's what violinists do
when they tune their violin,

393
00:25:06 --> 00:25:12
they change the tension on the
string to get just the right

394
00:25:09 --> 00:25:15
frequency.
But the playing means you

395
00:25:11 --> 00:25:17
change L.
A piano is different,

396
00:25:12 --> 00:25:18
that's really a luxury.
A piano has 88 keys,

397
00:25:15 --> 00:25:21
and the length of each set of
strings is fixed,

398
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
so you don't have to worry
about that.

399
00:25:20 --> 00:25:26
It's a great luxury,
you may think,

400
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
therefore, that it is much
easier to play the piano that to

401
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
play a violin,
because you don't have to do

402
00:25:27 --> 00:25:33
this all the time,
and be exactly at the right

403
00:25:29 --> 00:25:35
length.
Well, that is true,

404
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
of course, but given the fact
that you have 88

405
00:25:35 --> 00:25:41
keys, you can imagine you
can hit occasionally the wrong

406
00:25:39 --> 00:25:45
key, and that's not what you
want.

407
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
If a string is vibrating,
it is pushing on the air,

408
00:25:44 --> 00:25:50
and it's pulling on the air,
and it's producing thereby what

409
00:25:48 --> 00:25:54
we call pressure waves.
If I have a string that

410
00:25:51 --> 00:25:57
oscillates 400 hertz,
it makes pressure waves --

411
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
pressure goes up,
down, up, down,

412
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
up, down -- 400 times
per second it goes up,

413
00:26:00 --> 00:26:06
it reaches your eardrum,
and your eardrum starts to

414
00:26:03 --> 00:26:09
shake 400 times per
second,

415
00:26:07 --> 00:26:13
it goes back and forth,
and your brain say,

416
00:26:09 --> 00:26:15
"I hear sound."
That's the way it works.

417
00:26:12 --> 00:26:18
So it is the string,
then you get the air,

418
00:26:14 --> 00:26:20
pressure waves,
and then you get your eardrum,

419
00:26:17 --> 00:26:23
and then you get to brains,
if there are any.

420
00:26:19 --> 00:26:25
Now, I want to discuss with you
before I demonstrate some of

421
00:26:23 --> 00:26:29
this, I want to discuss with you
instruments which don't have

422
00:26:27 --> 00:26:33
strings, and I will call them
all woodwind instruments,

423
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
although that's perhaps not an
appropriate name for all of

424
00:26:33 --> 00:26:39
them.
But I'll just call them

425
00:26:35 --> 00:26:41
woodwinds
for now.

426
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
And suppose I have,
here, a box which is filled

427
00:26:40 --> 00:26:46
with air.
Completely closed box,

428
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
and it has a length L.
And I put in here a

429
00:26:45 --> 00:26:51
loudspeaker, and I generate a
particular frequency of sound.

430
00:26:50 --> 00:26:56
Then pressure waves are going
to run, they're going to bounce

431
00:26:54 --> 00:27:00
off, and they come back,
and I get reflected traveling

432
00:26:57 --> 00:27:03
waves.
And what I get inside the --

433
00:27:00 --> 00:27:06
the box, now,
I get standing waves of air.

434
00:27:03 --> 00:27:09
It's not the box that goes into
a standing resonance,

435
00:27:06 --> 00:27:12
but it's the air itself.
And the

436
00:27:10 --> 00:27:16
frequencies that are produced,
at which the system is in

437
00:27:14 --> 00:27:20
resonance, is given exactly by
the same equation.

438
00:27:17 --> 00:27:23
Except, now,
that V is non-negotiable -- V

439
00:27:20 --> 00:27:26
is now the speed of sound,
which, at room temperature,

440
00:27:24 --> 00:27:30
is about 340 meters per second.

441
00:27:27 --> 00:27:33
So whenever you design an --
wi- we- woodwind instruments,

442
00:27:31 --> 00:27:37
that is non-negotiable.
You cannot change V,

443
00:27:34 --> 00:27:40
which you can do when you are
an instrument builder of

444
00:27:38 --> 00:27:44
strings.
You will say,

445
00:27:40 --> 00:27:46
"Gee, if I have an instrument
whereby the sound is inside a

446
00:27:44 --> 00:27:50
closed box, you're not going to
hear very much." Well,

447
00:27:48 --> 00:27:54
that's true.
You must let the sound go out

448
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
somehow.
And what is surprising,

449
00:27:53 --> 00:27:59
that if you take this end out
-- off -- and you take this end

450
00:27:57 --> 00:28:03
off, that this box,
which is now open on both

451
00:28:00 --> 00:28:06
sides, will still resonate at
exactly those frequencies.

452
00:28:04 --> 00:28:10
And you've got to take 8.03 to get to the bottom of

453
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
this.
There are also resonant

454
00:28:11 --> 00:28:17
frequencies in case that the
sound cavity -- if I call this a

455
00:28:16 --> 00:28:22
sound cavity -- is closed on one
end and open on one end.

456
00:28:20 --> 00:28:26
The series of resonant
frequencies is different from

457
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
this one, though.
It's not so important,

458
00:28:27 --> 00:28:33
but it is different.
But you also get a whole series

459
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
of resonance frequencies.
The velocity of sound in a gas,

460
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
V, is the square root of the
temperature -- so it's a little

461
00:28:40 --> 00:28:46
temperature-dependent --
divided by the molecular weight.

462
00:28:43 --> 00:28:49
Well, you can't do much about
the temperature in a room -- in

463
00:28:46 --> 00:28:52
general, it's room temperature
-- and with air,

464
00:28:49 --> 00:28:55
you are stuck with the
molecular weight,

465
00:28:51 --> 00:28:57
oxygen and nitrogen is about
30, there is not much you

466
00:28:54 --> 00:29:00
can do about that.
But every one of you who plays

467
00:28:57 --> 00:29:03
woodwind instruments know that
if you go from a cold room to a

468
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
warm room that your instrument
is no longer in tune.

469
00:29:03 --> 00:29:09
And that's because of this,
the temperature change.

470
00:29:06 --> 00:29:12
So V changes,
so your fundamentals change.

471
00:29:08 --> 00:29:14
And what do you do know?
These people know what they do.

472
00:29:13 --> 00:29:19
They have a way of making the
cavity a little shorter or a

473
00:29:16 --> 00:29:22
little longer.
It's not very much,

474
00:29:18 --> 00:29:24
but they have a little bit to
play with.

475
00:29:21 --> 00:29:27
And when they do that,
so they compensate L for the

476
00:29:24 --> 00:29:30
slight difference in V to get
back to the same fundamental

477
00:29:27 --> 00:29:33
that they need.
So now you have a woodwind

478
00:29:30 --> 00:29:36
instrument.
Low-frequency woodwind

479
00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
instruments will be big.
And high-frequency woodwind

480
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
instruments will be small,
because in L lies the secret,

481
00:29:38 --> 00:29:44
you can't fool around with V,
V is a God-given.

482
00:29:42 --> 00:29:48
And so how do you play an
instrument now?

483
00:29:44 --> 00:29:50
Well, you have to change L,
that's all you can do.

484
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
And if you have a trombone,
you're doing this,

485
00:29:50 --> 00:29:56
it's clear that you're changing
L, you make the cavity shorter

486
00:29:53 --> 00:29:59
and longer.
So that's easy.

487
00:29:55 --> 00:30:01
If you have a flute,
you have holes in the flute.

488
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
And if all the holes are
closed, the flute is this long.

489
00:30:01 --> 00:30:07
But if you take your fingers
off the holes,

490
00:30:03 --> 00:30:09
it gets shorter.
And so when you take all your

491
00:30:06 --> 00:30:12
fingers off the holes,
then you have a high frequency

492
00:30:09 --> 00:30:15
-- flute is only this long,
if you put all your fingers on

493
00:30:14 --> 00:30:20
it, it's this long,
and so the frequency is lower.

494
00:30:18 --> 00:30:24
And a trumpet is the same idea.
You have valves that open holes

495
00:30:22 --> 00:30:28
and close holes.
If you blow air in an

496
00:30:25 --> 00:30:31
instrument, it is like plucking
a string, it's like exciting a

497
00:30:30 --> 00:30:36
string with a bow,
you are dumping a whole

498
00:30:33 --> 00:30:39
spectrum of frequencies onto
that air cavity.

499
00:30:36 --> 00:30:42
And you let the air cavity
decide where it wants to

500
00:30:40 --> 00:30:46
resonate.
And it will pick out the ones

501
00:30:43 --> 00:30:49
that it likes,
it will pick out the

502
00:30:46 --> 00:30:52
fundamental, and maybe the
second and the third harmonic.

503
00:30:49 --> 00:30:55
So in that sense,
blowing air is like striking it

504
00:30:52 --> 00:30:58
with a bow, in the case of a
string instrument.

505
00:30:55 --> 00:31:01
But blowing air is not always
as easy as you may think it is.

506
00:30:59 --> 00:31:05
Have you ever tried to blow air
into a trumpet?

507
00:31:02 --> 00:31:08
Nothing happens.
You just blow,

508
00:31:04 --> 00:31:10
[pffff], and you hear nothing.
You have to do this.

509
00:31:07 --> 00:31:13
[ppppppp].
Something like that.

510
00:31:09 --> 00:31:15
A bizarre sound you have to
make,

511
00:31:13 --> 00:31:19
you have to know how to spit in
the instrument just the right

512
00:31:17 --> 00:31:23
way to get a sound out of it.
I've tried it many times,

513
00:31:21 --> 00:31:27
it's really not easy.
So blowing air is just said in

514
00:31:25 --> 00:31:31
a simple way,
but in order to get it exc- to

515
00:31:28 --> 00:31:34
resonate, you've got to really
know how to hold your lips,

516
00:31:32 --> 00:31:38
and how to excite that cavity.
I can show you the easy

517
00:31:35 --> 00:31:41
relation between the frequency
of the fundamental and the

518
00:31:39 --> 00:31:45
length of woodwind instruments.
That's a one-to-one correlation

519
00:31:44 --> 00:31:50
--
this is on the web,

520
00:31:46 --> 00:31:52
you can download it,
you don't have to copy this --

521
00:31:49 --> 00:31:55
and you see there that,
uh, this is only for an open

522
00:31:52 --> 00:31:58
open system,
this is not for a closed open

523
00:31:55 --> 00:32:01
system.
The number would be different.

524
00:31:57 --> 00:32:03
So if you are interested in
very high frequencies,

525
00:32:00 --> 00:32:06
then an open open system which
is only one centimeter long

526
00:32:03 --> 00:32:09
would give you a fundamental of
17000 Hertz,

527
00:32:07 --> 00:32:13
which most of you can hear,
because you're still young,

528
00:32:10 --> 00:32:16
you can hear up to 20
kilohertz, probably.

529
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
The second harmonic you
would not be able to hear,

530
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23
that is too high for you.
An instrument which is 10

531
00:32:20 --> 00:32:26
centimeters long,
open open, you would here the

532
00:32:23 --> 00:32:29
fundamental easily,
1700 hertz,

533
00:32:25 --> 00:32:31
second harmonic,
3400 hertz,

534
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
no problem, third harmonic,
fourth harmonic,

535
00:32:31 --> 00:32:37
no problem.
And then when you go to the

536
00:32:33 --> 00:32:39
very low frequencies,
uh, organ pipes that produce

537
00:32:36 --> 00:32:42
fundamentals in the range 20 and 30 hertz,

538
00:32:39 --> 00:32:45
are huge in size.
And you -- in general,

539
00:32:42 --> 00:32:48
that holds.
When you have a woodwind

540
00:32:44 --> 00:32:50
instrument
which is tunes for low

541
00:32:47 --> 00:32:53
frequencies, it's big.
And for high frequencies,

542
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
like a flute,
it's small.

543
00:32:52 --> 00:32:58
In a way, that's also true for
string instruments.

544
00:32:55 --> 00:33:01
A bass which generates low
frequencies, it's a big

545
00:32:59 --> 00:33:05
instrument.
But the violin,

546
00:33:01 --> 00:33:07
which generates high
frequencies, is a much shorter

547
00:33:04 --> 00:33:10
instrument.
So in that sense,

548
00:33:06 --> 00:33:12
the reason is,
they have both an L here.

549
00:33:09 --> 00:33:15
And it's the L,
of course, that is crucial in

550
00:33:12 --> 00:33:18
terms of the fundamental.
So I can now ge- uh,

551
00:33:16 --> 00:33:22
demonstrate to you the basic
idea of a flute -- this is a

552
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
flute.
Now, the flute is this long.

553
00:33:28 --> 00:33:34
[plays flute].
Low frequency.

554
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38
[plays flute].
Higher frequency,

555
00:33:36 --> 00:33:42
because it's shorter.
[plays flute].

556
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
Even higher frequency,
because it's shorter.

557
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
[plays flute].
That's all it takes.

558
00:33:55 --> 00:34:01
[applause]
Trombone.

559
00:33:59 --> 00:34:05
That speaks for itself,
right?

560
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
Make it longer,
you make it shorter.

561
00:34:14 --> 00:34:20
I'll try it.
[plays trombone] [applause]

562
00:34:23 --> 00:34:29
Trombone.

563
00:34:27 --> 00:34:33
Wind organ.
80 centimeters long.

564
00:34:34 --> 00:34:40
Open and open,
on both sides.

565
00:34:35 --> 00:34:41
80 centimeters,
it would give me a fundamental

566
00:34:38 --> 00:34:44
a little higher than 170.

567
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
And then it will give me a
second harmonic,

568
00:34:43 --> 00:34:49
and a third harmonic,
it all depends on how fast the

569
00:34:46 --> 00:34:52
air is flowing by,
and there will be moments that

570
00:34:49 --> 00:34:55
you will hear more than one
harmonic.

571
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
I'll try to swing it around.
It's not easy for me to hit the

572
00:34:54 --> 00:35:00
fundamental, but I'll try that,
too.

573
00:34:56 --> 00:35:02
This is the second harmonic.

574
00:34:59 --> 00:35:05
Third harmonic.
[wind organ] Fourth harmonic.

575
00:35:01 --> 00:35:07
[wind organ] Fifth harmonic.
[wind organ] Fourth.

576
00:35:07 --> 00:35:13
[wind organ] Furdamen-,
this is fundamental.

00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
[applause] Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

582
00:35:38 --> 00:35:44
If you bang on a tuning fork,
or you pluck on a string,

583
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
in isolation,
you hear nothing,

584
00:35:46 --> 00:35:52
almost nothing.
I have here a tuning fork,

585
00:35:49 --> 00:35:55
and if I bang on it,
you hear nothing,

586
00:35:53 --> 00:35:59
and I hear nothing -- almost
nothing.

587
00:35:56 --> 00:36:02
Unless I heel- hold it very
close to my ear.

588
00:36:00 --> 00:36:06
What we do now,
with string instruments,

589
00:36:05 --> 00:36:11
we mount the strings on a box
with air.

590
00:36:08 --> 00:36:14
A sound cavity.
Sound- sounding board,

591
00:36:10 --> 00:36:16
it's called.
And now the air inside can s-

592
00:36:13 --> 00:36:19
oscillate with it -- it doesn't
always have to be precisely at

593
00:36:18 --> 00:36:24
resonance -- and also,
the surface itself of the box

594
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
can start to vibrate.
So you're displacing more air,

595
00:36:25 --> 00:36:31
and the sound becomes loud and
clear.

596
00:36:28 --> 00:36:34
You don't gain energy,
but you drain the energy out of

597
00:36:31 --> 00:36:37
the oscillating string faster,
and so for that short amount of

598
00:36:37 --> 00:36:43
time, you get louder sound.
And I will demonstrate that,

599
00:36:42 --> 00:36:48
first, with the tuning fork.
I hear it now very well,

600
00:36:46 --> 00:36:52
it's harder for you because
it's farther away.

601
00:36:50 --> 00:36:56
Now you hear nothing.
And now you hear it.

602
00:36:54 --> 00:37:00
It can actually be much better
demonstrated with this little

603
00:36:58 --> 00:37:04
music box that I bought years
ago in Switzerland.

604
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
If I rotate this music box,
it has a very romantic tune,

605
00:37:08 --> 00:37:14
you hear nothing.
I hear a little bit.

606
00:37:11 --> 00:37:17
And now I put it on this box,
unmistakable.

607
00:37:15 --> 00:37:21
So that's the idea of sounding
boards.

608
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24
You have them violins,
you have them on pianos,

609
00:37:22 --> 00:37:28
and, of course,
the design of these sounding

610
00:37:26 --> 00:37:32
boards is top-secret,
the manufacturer is not going

611
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
to tell you how they built them,
because the quality of the

612
00:37:35 --> 00:37:41
sound, of course,
is partly in the

613
00:37:39 --> 00:37:45
design of the sounding board.
I can make you hear,

614
00:37:44 --> 00:37:50
and I can make you see sound.
And my goal for the remaining

615
00:37:49 --> 00:37:55
time is to make you see and hear
at the same time.

616
00:37:53 --> 00:37:59
I have here a microphone,
which is like your eardrum,

617
00:37:58 --> 00:38:04
and suppose I generate 440 Hertz,

618
00:38:02 --> 00:38:08
and I can do that with the
tuning fork.

619
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
So here is the amplitude of the
oscillation of the membrane in

620
00:38:12 --> 00:38:18
the microphone,
which is your eardrum,

621
00:38:15 --> 00:38:21
say, we amplify that,
and we show you on an

622
00:38:18 --> 00:38:24
oscilloscope,
the current after

623
00:38:20 --> 00:38:26
amplification.
And so you're going to see a

624
00:38:24 --> 00:38:30
signal like this.
And if this is

625
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
Hertz, so this is time,
and this is the displacement of

626
00:38:32 --> 00:38:38
your eardrum -- in our case,
it's a microphone,

627
00:38:35 --> 00:38:41
it's really a current after
amplification -- and if this is

628
00:38:40 --> 00:38:46
440 Hertz,
then this time T will be about

629
00:38:45 --> 00:38:51
2.3 milliseconds.
One divided by 440.

630
00:38:49 --> 00:38:55
That's no problem for an

631
00:38:51 --> 00:38:57
oscilloscope.
We can do much better than

632
00:38:54 --> 00:39:00
that.
So the time resolution is not a

633
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
problem.
And so I will show you there

634
00:38:58 --> 00:39:04
the output of our microphone,
I will show you this signal as

635
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
a function of time.
For

636
00:39:05 --> 00:39:11
Hertz, you see a boring signal.
And I can make a boring signal

637
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
with a tuning fork,
it's almost a pure sinusoid.

638
00:39:12 --> 00:39:18
But now, it just so happens,

639
00:39:16 --> 00:39:22
we have in our audie- in our
audience, someone who can play

640
00:39:20 --> 00:39:26
the violin.
And that person is going to

641
00:39:22 --> 00:39:28
produce a
Hertz.

642
00:39:24 --> 00:39:30
But at the same time,
he's going to produce a second

643
00:39:27 --> 00:39:33
harmonic, and maybe a third
harmonic, and maybe a fourth

644
00:39:31 --> 00:39:37
harmonic.
And so, imagine now,

645
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
that at th- simultaneously,
your eardrum is going to do

646
00:39:36 --> 00:39:42
this, but at the same time,
your eardrum is going to do

647
00:39:39 --> 00:39:45
this, because this is some
higher harmonic.

648
00:39:42 --> 00:39:48
Then the net result is that
your eardrum is going to do

649
00:39:45 --> 00:39:51
this.
And that is what I'm going to

650
00:39:47 --> 00:39:53
show
you.

651
00:39:49 --> 00:39:55
And so when you see the various
instruments, you will recognize

652
00:39:53 --> 00:39:59
that on top of the fundamental,
you will see these very

653
00:39:57 --> 00:40:03
characteristic harmonics,
each instrument having its own

654
00:40:00 --> 00:40:06
cocktail, its own unique
cocktail, and when you hear that

655
00:40:04 --> 00:40:10
cocktail, you say,
"Oh, yes, that's a saxophone."

656
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
Or you say, "No,
that's a violin."

657
00:40:09 --> 00:40:15
You would never mistaken a
saxophone for a violin.

658
00:40:12 --> 00:40:18
And that's because of the
combination of the higher

659
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
harmonics.
And so we are so fortunate

660
00:40:19 --> 00:40:25
that we have four musicians in
our audience.

661
00:40:23 --> 00:40:29
Tom, who is the violinist --
where is Tom?

662
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
There's Tom.
[applause].

663
00:40:28 --> 00:40:34
I hope you brought your violin
[laughs].

664
00:40:32 --> 00:40:38
Oh, you got it there.
And then we have Emily -- I saw

665
00:40:36 --> 00:40:42
her already, with the clarinet
-- so if you come this way,

666
00:40:41 --> 00:40:47
Emily [applause].
And we have Aaron -- Aaron has

667
00:40:45 --> 00:40:51
a bassoon.
You may never have a bassoon.

668
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
A bassoon is an instrument that
produces a very low tone.

669
00:40:56 --> 00:41:02
So the instrument is going to
be very big.

670
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
Bigger than -- bigger than
Aaron.

671
00:41:04 --> 00:41:10
Just wait and see.
It's a beauty, it's a really beautiful

672
00:41:10 --> 00:41:16
instrument.
A flute is only this big.

673
00:41:14 --> 00:41:20
Ah, look at that,
beautiful, big,

674
00:41:17 --> 00:41:23
bassoon.
And then we have Fabian,

675
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
with a saxophone.
[applause].

676
00:41:24 --> 00:41:30
So if you stand here,
then I will first do the boring

677
00:41:29 --> 00:41:35
part, and what I will do is I
will show you,

678
00:41:33 --> 00:41:39
then, 440 hertz signal looks like,

679
00:41:39 --> 00:41:45
produced with a tuning fork --
and we'll see it there,

680
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
and so I have to change the
light situation substantially.

681
00:41:51 --> 00:41:57
The musicians
will get a little bit into the

682
00:41:56 --> 00:42:02
dark, but you will still be able
to see them.

683
00:42:00 --> 00:42:06
And so I'm going to turn on,
now, the microphone,

684
00:42:04 --> 00:42:10
and that's where you're going
to see the signal,

685
00:42:09 --> 00:42:15
and when you make noise,
you can hear -- hear and see

686
00:42:14 --> 00:42:20
yourself.
440.

687
00:42:15 --> 00:42:21
Boring, and no signs of higher
harmonics.

688
00:42:19 --> 00:42:25
Now Tom will try to produce
440 in his violin -- or

689
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
close to 440 -- and then
look for the higher harmonics,

690
00:42:32 --> 00:42:38
which makes the violin
characteristic.

691
00:42:36 --> 00:42:42
[plays violin].
Notice that the average

692
00:42:40 --> 00:42:46
spacing, the repetition,
is, indeed, the same as it was

693
00:42:46 --> 00:42:52
with the 440,
but you saw this incredible

694
00:42:51 --> 00:42:57
richness
of harmonics.

695
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03
Tom happens to be,
also, an excellent violin

696
00:43:09 --> 00:43:15
player, and so he insisted that
he demonstrate that.

697
00:43:23 --> 00:43:29
[laughter] All right,
Tom?

698
00:43:29 --> 00:43:35
Student: All right.
OK.

699
00:43:35 --> 00:43:41
Go ahead.
[plays violin].

700
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
Terrific, Tom.
[applause].

701
00:43:53 --> 00:43:59
Emily, would you mind producing
something that comes close to

702
00:43:58 --> 00:44:04
440 Hertz?
Come a little closer to the

703
00:44:03 --> 00:44:09
microphone.
[plays clarinet].

704
00:44:05 --> 00:44:11
Notice the big difference with
the violin.

705
00:44:09 --> 00:44:15
Violin has many,
many higher harmonics.

706
00:44:13 --> 00:44:19
Her instrument,
maybe only one,

707
00:44:15 --> 00:44:21
maybe only the fundamental and
the second harmonic.

708
00:44:20 --> 00:44:26
Can you try again?
[plays clarinet].

709
00:44:23 --> 00:44:29
Now we have more,
now we have more.

710
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
[plays clarinet].
Now, Emily did not insist that

711
00:44:33 --> 00:44:39
she wanted to play,
but I did.

712
00:44:37 --> 00:44:43
So Emily, would you please?
[plays clarinet].

713
00:44:43 --> 00:44:49
Impressive.
[applause].

714
00:44:45 --> 00:44:51
Aaron, with his bassoon.
He ordered a special chair,

715
00:44:52 --> 00:44:58
because he says,
"Look, with an instrument so

716
00:44:58 --> 00:45:04
big,
L is so large,

717
00:45:01 --> 00:45:07
it's heavy." Clearly,
a bass, which produces low

718
00:45:05 --> 00:45:11
frequencies, is heavier than a
violin, and the same is true

719
00:45:10 --> 00:45:16
with woodwind instruments.
Aaron, could you try something

720
00:45:15 --> 00:45:21
close to 440?
[plays bassoon].

721
00:45:18 --> 00:45:24
Bizarre instrument,
isn't it, eh?

722
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
You see a weird combination of
probably fundamental and second

723
00:45:26 --> 00:45:32
harmonic.
Aaron, would you mind showing

724
00:45:29 --> 00:45:35
some of your expertise?
This is a wonderful instrument.

725
00:45:44 --> 00:45:50
You don't see them too often,
do you?

726
00:45:58 --> 00:46:04
[plays bassoon].
Terrific.

727
00:46:07 --> 00:46:13
[applause].
Last, but --

728
00:46:18 --> 00:46:24
but not least,
we have a saxophone,

729
00:46:20 --> 00:46:26
Fabian.
Now, you may have to stand a

730
00:46:22 --> 00:46:28
long distance from this
microphone, because these

731
00:46:26 --> 00:46:32
instruments make a hell of a lot
of noise, don't they?

732
00:46:29 --> 00:46:35
So give it a shot,
and try 440,

733
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
or come close to that.
It doesn't have to be exact.

734
00:46:34 --> 00:46:40
[plays saxophone].
Interesting.

735
00:46:36 --> 00:46:42
Also, you see several higher
harmonics, it's hard to s- hard

736
00:46:40 --> 00:46:46
to tell which.
Would you mind,

737
00:46:42 --> 00:46:48
uh, playing something real hot?
[laughter] [plays saxophone]

738
00:46:45 --> 00:46:51
[unintelligible] [laughter]
[noise]

739
00:46:49 --> 00:46:55
If you think we're interested
in hearing it,

740
00:46:57 --> 00:47:03
you're wrong,
we want to see it!

741
00:47:02 --> 00:47:08
[laughter] [plays saxophone].
[unintelligible] [laughter]

742
00:47:12 --> 00:47:18
[unintelligible].
[plays saxophone].

743
00:47:20 --> 00:47:26
[applause].
Thank all of them.

744
00:47:22 --> 00:47:28
[applause] Thank you very much.
[applause] So during the last

745
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
three minutes,
I would like to discuss with

746
00:47:32 --> 00:47:38
you the speed of sound in a
little bit more detail.

747
00:47:37 --> 00:47:43
Uh, you notice that the speed
of sound is the -- proportional

748
00:47:43 --> 00:47:49
with the temperature and the
molecular weight.

749
00:47:47 --> 00:47:53
In fact there are a few other
things

750
00:47:51 --> 00:47:57
upstairs here.
But these are the -- these are

751
00:47:55 --> 00:48:01
the major contributors.
So I should really say it's

752
00:47:59 --> 00:48:05
proportional.
If you take air -- as we

753
00:48:01 --> 00:48:07
discussed earlier,
molecular weight is 30,

754
00:48:05 --> 00:48:11
that's a God-given,
there's not much you can do

755
00:48:08 --> 00:48:14
about it.
I would like to demonstrate to

756
00:48:11 --> 00:48:17
you, the dependence on molecular
weight.

757
00:48:14 --> 00:48:20
And one way I could do that,
I could take all the air out of

758
00:48:19 --> 00:48:25
26
and replace it with helium.

759
00:48:23 --> 00:48:29
And
then I would ask the same

760
00:48:26 --> 00:48:32
musicians to come,
and I would ask them,

761
00:48:28 --> 00:48:34
then, to play their wind
instruments.

762
00:48:31 --> 00:48:37
The Ls are fixed,
there's nothing you can do

763
00:48:33 --> 00:48:39
about it.
So their instruments don't know

764
00:48:36 --> 00:48:42
that I put helium in the
audience, so the only thing that

765
00:48:39 --> 00:48:45
changes is V.
The speed would go up by almost

766
00:48:42 --> 00:48:48
a factor of three,
and so the fundamental would be

767
00:48:45 --> 00:48:51
free -- three times higher.
And the harmonics would be

768
00:48:49 --> 00:48:55
three times higher.
So you would hear much higher

769
00:48:52 --> 00:48:58
frequencies.
And you wouldn't even recognize

770
00:48:56 --> 00:49:02
these instruments.
This wouldn't be very

771
00:48:59 --> 00:49:05
practical.
I cannot take the air out of

772
00:49:02 --> 00:49:08
26-100,
and replace it with helium.

773
00:49:07 --> 00:49:13
But what I can do,
as I have done so often here in

774
00:49:11 --> 00:49:17
26-100,
I can suffer myself -- I can

775
00:49:15 --> 00:49:21
suffer, and put helium in my
system.

776
00:49:18 --> 00:49:24
I have, here -- I have,
here, my own sound cavity.

777
00:49:23 --> 00:49:29
I am, in a way,
like a wind instrument.

778
00:49:27 --> 00:49:33
And, um, if I swallow helium,
my sound cavity doesn't know

779
00:49:32 --> 00:49:38
that I'm producing helium.
And you will say,

780
00:49:35 --> 00:49:41
when I talk to you as I do
right now, "Yes,

781
00:49:38 --> 00:49:44
that's typical,
that's Walter Lewin." You

782
00:49:41 --> 00:49:47
recognize my fundamentals,
you recognize my harmonics,

783
00:49:45 --> 00:49:51
and it's unique for my voice.
And so you will recognize me.

784
00:49:49 --> 00:49:55
But the moment that I fill my
system with helium,

785
00:49:53 --> 00:49:59
nothing is changing in my
system except for V.

786
00:49:56 --> 00:50:02
And so the frequency will go
up.

787
00:50:00 --> 00:50:06
And that will be noticeable.
And, in fact,

788
00:50:03 --> 00:50:09
chances are that you will say,
"Hm, that's really not Walter

789
00:50:07 --> 00:50:13
Lewin any more." There's only
one problem with helium.

790
00:50:11 --> 00:50:17
And that is there is no oxygen
in helium.

791
00:50:14 --> 00:50:20
And that is also very
noticeable for me.

792
00:50:17 --> 00:50:23
And yet, I really have to fill
my lungs with helium all the

793
00:50:21 --> 00:50:27
way, and so I will be,
for a while,

794
00:50:24 --> 00:50:30
without oxygen,
and, um, so you may catch two

795
00:50:27 --> 00:50:33
birds with one stone.
You may hear a

796
00:50:33 --> 00:50:39
strange frequency,
and you see me on the floor.

797
00:50:36 --> 00:50:42
So I'll really try not to fall
on the floor,

798
00:50:39 --> 00:50:45
then.
OK, there we go.

799
00:50:41 --> 00:50:47
[laughter].
And it really doesn't sound

800
00:50:44 --> 00:50:50
like Walter Lewin any more,
does it?

801
00:50:47 --> 00:50:53
I will see you Friday.
All the best.

802
00:50:49 --> 00:50:55
[applause].
Whew.
