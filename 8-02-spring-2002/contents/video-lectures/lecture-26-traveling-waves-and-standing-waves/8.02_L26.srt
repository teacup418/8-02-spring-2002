00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,499



2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:06,527
So today, I will start with a
general discussion on waves,

3
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:11,075
as an introduction to
electromagnetic waves,

4
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:14,353
which we will discuss next
week.

5
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:19,218
We'll start with a very
down-to-earth equation,

6
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:24,612
Y equals one-third X.
And I'm going to plot that for

7
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:30,746
you, so here is Y and here is X,
and that's a straight line

8
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:36,458
through the origin,
Y equals one-third X.

9
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:40,13
Suppose, now,
I want this line to move.

10
00:00:40,13 --> 00:00:46,025
I want this line to move with a
speed of six meters per second

11
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:51,341
in the plus X direction.
All I will have to do now is to

12
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:55,496
replace X in that equation by X
minus six T.

13
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:59,169
Notice the minus sign.
I will go, then,

14
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:04,097
in the plus X direction.
The equation then becomes Y

15
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,93
equals one-third times X minus
six T.

16
00:01:08,93 --> 00:01:14,189
So look at it at T equals 1.
At T equals zero,

17
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,097
you already have the line.
At T equals one,

18
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:24,122
you now have Y equals one-third
X minus two.

19
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:29,615
That means, here it will
intersect at minus two,

20
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:36,744
and there it will intersect at
plus six, and the line parallel

21
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:42,839
to the first one,
this line is now T equals one,

22
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:47,543
and this is T equals zero.
And it has moved in this

23
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:52,058
direction, with a speed of six
meters per second.

24
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:57,797
And so what this is telling us,
that if we ever want something

25
00:01:57,797 --> 00:02:02,125
to move with a speed V in the
plus X direction,

26
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:07,393
then all we have to do in our
equations to replace X by X

27
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:14,354
minus V T, and if we want it to
move in the minus X direction,

28
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:18,099
then we replace X by X plus V
T.

29
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:24,742
That's all we have to do.
So now, I'm going to change to

30
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:31,265
something that is a real wave.
I now have Y equals two,

31
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:36,096
times the sine of three X.
That's a wave.

32
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:38,995
It's not moving,
not yet.

33
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:44,31
So I can make a plot of Y as a
function of X,

34
00:02:44,31 --> 00:02:49,746
and that plot will be like
this.

35
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:54,029
This is zero,
so when the sine is zero,

36
00:02:54,029 --> 00:03:00,117
this is pi divided by three,
and this is hundred eighty

37
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:06,204
degrees, and it's again zero,
this is two pi divided by

38
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:12,066
three, it's again zero.
And lambda, which we call the

39
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,674
wavelength, lambda,
in this case,

40
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:20,86
is from here to here,
that is two pi divided by

41
00:03:20,86 --> 00:03:25,537
three,
this goes also from here to

42
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:28,636
there.
I will introduce a symbol K

43
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:33,613
that you will often see,
we call that the wave number,

44
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:38,402
and K is simply defined as two
pi divided by lambda.

45
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:41,688
So in our specific case,
K is three.

46
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,35
This here is K.
If you know this number,

47
00:03:45,35 --> 00:03:49,764
you can immediately tell what
the wavelength is.

48
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,957
Now, I want to have this wave
move.

49
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:57,365
I want to have a traveling
wave.

50
00:03:57,365 --> 00:04:02,843
And I want to have it move with
six meters per second in the

51
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,743
plus X direction.
So the recipe is now very

52
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:11,943
simple, all I have to do replace
this X by X minus six T.

53
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:16,865
So now I get Y equals two times
the sine, times three,

54
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:21,229
times X minus six T.
And if you now look at this

55
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:25,779
curve, this equation,
and you plot it a little bit

56
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:31,918
later in time than T zero
-- this is already T zero -- a

57
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,191
little later in time,
you will see that,

58
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,884
indeed, it has moved in the
plus X direction.

59
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:43,331
And it's moving with a speed of
six meters per second.

60
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,436
So this equation,
when you look at it,

61
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:50,465
holds all the characteristics
of the oscillation.

62
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:54,577
It holds the amplitude.
This two is the amplitude.

63
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:59,108
This is minus two,
that's the amplitude.

64
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:02,928
This information,
K, holds the information on the

65
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:07,702
wavelength, and this information
tells you what the speed is.

66
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:10,726
And the minus sign,
which is important,

67
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:14,624
tells you that it's going in
the plus X direction,

68
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:17,171
and not in the minus X
direction.

69
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,796
Can we make such a traveling
wave?

70
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:23,218
Yes, we can do that,
actually, quite easily.

71
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:27,833
Suppose I have here a rotating
wheel -- rotate with angular

72
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:32,848
frequency omega,
and let this has a radius R,

73
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:36,775
and I get the two units,
so that I get the same

74
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:41,64
amplitude that I have here.
And I attach to this a string,

75
00:05:41,64 --> 00:05:46,761
and I put some tension on the
string, so that I create a wave

76
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:50,26
as I rotate it,
and the string is attached

77
00:05:50,26 --> 00:05:54,869
here, and as it rotates,
the wave is going to propagate

78
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:58,71
into the string with a velocity,
let's say, V.

79
00:05:58,71 --> 00:06:02,79
So I can generate a traveling
wave.

80
00:06:02,79 --> 00:06:07,3
The period of one oscillation
-- if you were here on the

81
00:06:07,3 --> 00:06:10,743
string, you're going up,
you're going down,

82
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:13,531
you're going up,
you're going down,

83
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:17,958
that's all you're doing,
when the wave passes by -- the

84
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:22,959
period of one whole oscillation
is obviously two pi divided by

85
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,321
this omega.
The wavelength lambda that you

86
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:30,502
are creating -- from here to
here is lambda -- well,

87
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:35,831
if you know the speed with
which it is traveling,

88
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:40,727
and you know it has been
traveling capital T seconds,

89
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:44,587
one oscillation,
that's a distance lambda.

90
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:49,295
So this is V times T.
But this is also V divided by

91
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:52,402
F, if F is the frequency in
Hertz.

92
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:58,145
And so the frequency F is then
also given by the speed divided

93
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:01,723
by lambda.
And so I can write down this

94
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:05,583
equation now in a somewhat
different form,

95
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:12,139
Y equals two times the sine,
and now I bring the three

96
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,252
inside, so I get three X minus
eighteen T.

97
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:19,361
This eighteen is now that
omega.

98
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:23,474
This is omega T.
In here is all the timing

99
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:26,683
information.
Omega, the period T,

100
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:31,197
everything is in here.
Here is all the spatial

101
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,404
information.
This is K.

102
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:37,316
In here is the information
about lambda.

103
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:42,204
And so if I know omega,
and I know K,

104
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:46,411
then I can also find the
velocity, which is omega divided

105
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,665
by K.
So everything is in here,

106
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:53,248
omega divided by three gives me
back my six meters per second.

107
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:57,455
So once you have the equation,
I can ask you any question

108
00:07:57,455 --> 00:08:00,384
about that wave,
and you should be able,

109
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:02,488
then, to answer.
Wavelengths,

110
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:05,643
frequency, in Hertz,
in radians per second,

111
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,423
speed, everything.
You may ask me now,

112
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:10,827
"Why do you discuss this with
us?

113
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:15,824
Well, we are coming up to
electromagnetic waves next

114
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:19,553
week, and electromagnetic waves,
you're going to see lambdas,

115
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:23,158
you're going to see omegas,
you're going to see capital Ts,

116
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:26,452
you're going to see frequency,
you're going to see Ks,

117
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:29,809
everything you see there you're
going to see next week.

118
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,357
One exception,
that Y, the displacement Y,

119
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:35,714
will not be in centimeters or
meters, but it will be an

120
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:38,324
electric field,
a traveling electric field,

121
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:41,183
volts per meter.
Or a traveling magnetic field,

122
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:42,799
tesla.
But other than that,

123
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,586
all these quantities will
return in exactly the same way.

124
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:52,951
Now I want to discuss with you
a standing wave first,

125
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:57,903
because standing waves are
going to be important.

126
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:03,371
This is a traveling wave.
And now comes something even

127
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:07,601
more intriguing,
which is a standing wave.

128
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:12,657
Suppose I have a wave traveling
in this direction,

129
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:17,815
and I call that Y one,
and Y zero is the amplitude,

130
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:22,526
sine K X minus omega T.
And notice now,

131
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:25,714
I have all the symbols that we
are familiar with.

132
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,504
We have the K here,
we have the omega here,

133
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:32,423
and we have the amplitude here.
And the minus sign tells me,

134
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:35,346
[wssshhht], it's going in the
plus direction.

135
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:38,468
But I have another wave.
And the wave is exactly

136
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:41,391
identical, in terms of
amplitude, in terms of

137
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:44,313
wavelength, in terms of
frequency, identical,

138
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,705
but it's traveling in this
direction.

139
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:50,092
And so this is Y two,
which is Y zero times the sine

140
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:53,001
of K
X plus omega T.

141
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:57,557
This plus sign tells me it's
going in this direction.

142
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:02,376
And so if this is a string,
the net result is the sum of

143
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:05,267
the two.
So I have to add them up.

144
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:09,998
So Y is Y one plus Y two.
So I have to do some trigono-

145
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:14,73
trigonometric manipulation,
and this is what I leave --

146
00:10:14,73 --> 00:10:19,636
I'll leave you with that,
that's high school stuff -- you

147
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:24,806
add the two up and you'll find
two by zero --

148
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:29,568
notice that the amplitude has
doubled -- times the sine of K X

149
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:34,019
times the cosine of omega T.
That's the some of those two.

150
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,767
And this is very,
very different from a traveling

151
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,499
wave.
Nowhere will you see K X minus

152
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,764
omega T any more.
K X is here,

153
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:46,902
separate under the sine,
and omega T is separate under

154
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:50,025
the cosine.
All the timing information is

155
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:54,476
now separate from the spatial
information.

156
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:59,884
And so what does a standing
wave like this look like?

157
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:05,916
Well, let's  a bracket here.
Let's make a drawing of such a

158
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,244
standing wave.
So here we have Y,

159
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:14,444
and here we have X.
Let's only look at the sine K X

160
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,628
for now.
If X is zero,

161
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:24,221
the sine is always zero,
so this point will never move.

162
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:28,65
But if K X is hundred eighty
degrees, it's also zero,

163
00:11:28,65 --> 00:11:31,716
always.
So lambda over two will never

164
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,164
move.
X is lambda,

165
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:36,571
when this is three hundred
sixty degrees,

166
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,063
it will never move.
Minus lambda over two,

167
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:43,64
will never move.
So what will it look like?

168
00:11:43,64 --> 00:11:47,473
Well, you're going to see
something like this,

169
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:52,158
let's take the moment when T
equals zero, so when cosine

170
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:55,268
omega T is plus
one.

171
00:11:55,268 --> 00:12:00,933
So we're going to have a curve
like this, so this goes up to

172
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:06,695
two Y zero  like this -- and
this here is then my two Y zero.

173
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:12,265
These points will never move,
they will always stand still.

174
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,818
There's nothing like a
traveling wave.

175
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:21,099
If it's a traveling wave,
these points will see the wave

176
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:27,45
go by, they will go up and down,
they never do that.

177
00:12:27,45 --> 00:12:29,897
They sit still.
They have a name.

178
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:33,721
We call them nodes.
Let's now look at little later.

179
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:37,24
Let's look at T equals one
quarter of a period.

180
00:12:37,24 --> 00:12:41,293
Now, the cosine is zero.
So there's not a single point

181
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:45,959
on the string that is not zero.
So the string looks like this.

182
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,395
If you took a picture of the
string, you wouldn't even know

183
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,76
it's oscillating.
It would be just a straight

184
00:12:53,76 --> 00:12:56,208
line.
And now, if we do -- look a

185
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,094
little
later, and we look at T equals

186
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:03,442
one-half the period,
then the cosine is minus one.

187
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,902
So now the curve will look like
this.

188
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:09,456
And so what does it mean?
If we just look what's here

189
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,258
happening, this is what's going
to happen.

190
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,427
The string is just doing this,
and there are points that stand

191
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:18,682
still.
Nothing is going like this,

192
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:22,645
nothing is going like this.
You see this point going up and

193
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:24,695
down, up and down,
up and down,

194
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:28,044
and this will do the same,
and these nodes will do

195
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:32,381
nothing.
So that is what a standing wave

196
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,82
will look like,
and I think the name standing

197
00:13:35,82 --> 00:13:39,651
wave is a very appropriate name,
very descriptive,

198
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:44,107
because it's really standing,
it's not -- it's not moving.

199
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:47,624
At least, not traveling along
the X direction.

200
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:50,751
Can we make a standing wave?
Yes, we can,

201
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:55,051
and I will do that today.
A standing wave can be made by

202
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:59,038
shaking -- or rotating,
in that fashion -- a string.

203
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:04,237
So here I have a string,
I -- say I attach the string to

204
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:07,312
the wall there,
and I move it up and down here.

205
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:11,389
So a wave goes in -- I do just
this, like the rotating disc --

206
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:14,264
the wave travels,
but the wave is reflected,

207
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:18,208
and so I have a wave going in
and I have a wave coming back,

208
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,417
so I have now two waves going
through each other.

209
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:25,294
And if the conditions are just
right, then these reflective

210
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:28,77
waves -- this one will reflect,
when it arrives here,

211
00:14:28,77 --> 00:14:31,51
it will reflect again,
it goes back again,

212
00:14:31,51 --> 00:14:34,986
and it will continue to reflect
--

213
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:39,149
so if the conditions are just
right, then these reflective

214
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,531
waves will support each other,
and they will generate a large

215
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:47,475
amplitude -- as I will
demonstrate to you -- but that's

216
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:51,93
only the case for very specific
frequencies, and we call those

217
00:14:51,93 --> 00:14:55,581
resonant frequencies.
The lowest possible frequency

218
00:14:55,581 --> 00:15:00,109
for which this happens -- which
we call the fundamental -- will

219
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,519
make the string vibrate like
this.

220
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,244
So the whole thing goes.
[wssshhht],

221
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:10,154
[wssshhht], [wssshhht],
and we call that the

222
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:13,702
fundamental.
We call that also the first

223
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:16,43
harmonic.
If now I increase the

224
00:15:16,43 --> 00:15:21,069
frequencies, then I get a second
resonant frequency,

225
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:26,708
and a node jumps in the middle
-- there is already a node here,

226
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:31,71
and there is a node here,
because this motion of my hand

227
00:15:31,71 --> 00:15:37,35
here is very small,
as I will demonstrate to you,

228
00:15:37,35 --> 00:15:41,902
for all practical purpose you
can think of this being a node

229
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:46,609
-- and so now the string in the
second harmonic will oscillate

230
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:49,155
like this.
[Wssshhht], [wssshhht],

231
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:53,322
[wssshhht], [wssshhht],
so this is the second harmonic.

232
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:58,106
And if we go up in frequencies,
then -- this should be right in

233
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:02,813
the middle, by the way -- and if
I go up in frequency one step

234
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:06,749
more, then I get another
resonance whereby we get an

235
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:11,379
extra node, and so we get the
third harmonic,

236
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:14,3
and you just can go on like
that.

237
00:16:14,3 --> 00:16:18,59
You get a whole series of
resonance frequencies.

238
00:16:18,59 --> 00:16:23,976
And so, for the fundamental,
lambda one -- the one refers to

239
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:28,997
the first harmonic -- is two L,
if L is the length of my

240
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,549
string.
This is L.

241
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,204
You only have half a wavelength
here, so L is two L.

242
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:41,96
But we know that the frequency
is the velocity divided by the

243
00:16:41,96 --> 00:16:46,418
wavelength -- we see that
there, frequency is velocity

244
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:51,212
divided by the wavelength -- so
the frequency F one is the

245
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:56,091
velocity divided by lambda one,
so that's divided by two L.

246
00:16:56,091 --> 00:17:00,802
So that's the frequency in the
fundamental for which this

247
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:05,176
resonance phenomenon occurs.
For the second harmonic,

248
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:07,951
lambda two equals L.
You can tell,

249
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:10,811
you see a complete wavelength
here.

250
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:16,615
And F two, that frequency,
is going to be twice F one.

251
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:21,353
And F three is going to be
three times F one.

252
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:26,198
And if you want to know,
for the Nth harmonic,

253
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:31,043
N being Nancy,
then lambda of N equals N two L

254
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:34,597
divided by N.
Substitute in N one,

255
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:39,98
and you find the wavelength for
the first harmonic.

256
00:17:39,98 --> 00:17:45,579
Substitute for N two,
and you find the wavelength for

257
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:48,735
the second
harmonic.

258
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,677
And so on.
And the frequency for the Nth

259
00:17:51,677 --> 00:17:56,205
harmonic -- N stands for Nancy
-- is N times V divided by two

260
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:58,318
L.
So here you see the entire

261
00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:02,392
series of frequencies and
wavelengths for which we have

262
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:05,335
resonance.
Unlike in our LRC system that

263
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:09,108
we discussed last time,
where you had one resonance

264
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:13,182
frequency, now you have an
infinite number of resonance

265
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:18,163
frequencies, and they are at
very discrete values,

266
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,11
equally spaced.
I want to demonstrate this to

267
00:18:21,11 --> 00:18:24,527
you with a violin string,
it's a very special violin

268
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:27,542
string, it's here on the floor,
it's a biggie,

269
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,752
and I need some help from
someone.

270
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:32,834
You helped me before,
would you mind helping me

271
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,241
again?
So here is, uh,

272
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:37,524
one end of the string,
which you're going to hold,

273
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:40,471
you're going to be a node,
believe it or not.

274
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:42,548
Hold it better,
two hands -- no,

275
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:44,759
much better.
You will see shortly,

276
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,242
why -- no, no,
no, much better.

277
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:50,377
That's it.
And walk back a little,

278
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,318
walk further.
Yes, that's good,

279
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:54,647
hold it.
I will put on a white glove,

280
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:58,529
and there is a reason for that,
because I want you to be able

281
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,57
to see my hand when we're going
to make it dark,

282
00:19:01,57 --> 00:19:04,61
so that you will convince
yourself that my hand,

283
00:19:04,61 --> 00:19:08,039
which is generating the wave,
is hardly moving at all.

284
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,304
For practical purposes,
it's a node,

285
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:13,538
and yet we get this wonderful
resonance phenomenon.

286
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:17,42
So I'm going to make it very
dark so that the U V will do its

287
00:19:17,42 --> 00:19:21,234
job, and you can see
the string better,

288
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:24,784
that's the only way we can make
you see the string well.

289
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,268
All right.
Don't let go,

290
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:29,753
er- under any circumstances,
you will hurt me if you do

291
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,947
that.
Of course, if I let go first,

292
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:33,754
then [pfft],
I will hurt you,

293
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:37,239
but that's not my plan.
OK, so let's try to go a little

294
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,175
bit further back.
Let's try to,

295
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:41,628
uh, find, first the -- the
fundamental.

296
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:44,79
And I'll try to find it by
exciting just the right

297
00:19:44,79 --> 00:19:47,049
frequency with my hand.
There it is.

298
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,115
I think I got it.
That's the fundamental.

299
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:54,087
And look how little my hand is
moving here.

300
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:57,838
And you will see a very large
amplitude in the middle.

301
00:19:57,838 --> 00:20:01,023
And so these reflected waves,
one runs to him,

302
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:03,783
it runs back at me,
it runs back at him,

303
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:07,747
keeps reflecting many times,
they support each other in a

304
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:10,932
constructive way,
that's what resonance is all

305
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:13,338
about.
And now I'll try to find the

306
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:17,656
second harmonic -- so you'll see
another note coming in at the

307
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:20,345
middle.
It's easier for you to see than

308
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,663
for me, actually.
And it's not always easy

309
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:28,353
to find the -- no,
no, no, I'm too low frequency,

310
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,197
I have to go up.
I think I got it now.

311
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:34,042
Is this it?
Yes, one extra node in the

312
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,579
middle?
Speak out up,

313
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:38,039
please.
[chorus of agreement] Ah,

314
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,576
that's better.
Now I can hear you,

315
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:43,651
thank you.
Um, there are three nodes now.

316
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:47,88
My friend there is a node,
I'm a node, and then there is

317
00:20:47,88 --> 00:20:50,801
one in the middle.
If you subtract one,

318
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:56,721
the three minus one is two,
then it's the second harmonic.

319
00:20:56,721 --> 00:21:01,685
And so now I will try to
generate a very high frequency,

320
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:05,476
in resonance,
and then you count the number

321
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:09,628
of nodes, subtract one,
and then you know which

322
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:14,954
harmonic I was able to generate.
But I will try to -- not so

323
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:17,842
easy to get a resonance in
there.

324
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:20,099
No, I'm off resonance.
No.

325
00:21:20,099 --> 0.

326
0. --> 00:21:20,64
Yeah!

327
00:21:20,64 --> 00:21:21,543
Yeah!
Yeah!

328
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:22,446
Yeah!
Yeah!

329
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:23,348
Yeah!
Yeah!

330
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:28,73
[laughter] Got it,
got it, got it!

331
00:21:28,73 --> 00:21:30,778
Got it!
You keep counting.

332
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:33,81
Keep counting.
Oh, that's a super-high

333
00:21:33,81 --> 00:21:36,924
harmonic!
[crowd responds] How many did

334
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:39,464
you count?
[crowd responds] Ten,

335
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,742
do I hear ten?
[crowd responds] Do I hear

336
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:44,954
twenty?
[laughter] Actually,

337
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:48,478
I counted about twenty-seven,
but that's OK.

338
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:51,919
[laughter].
All right, thank you very much,

339
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,459
it was great that you helped
me.

340
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:58,155
[applause].
So that's, uh,

341
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:01,292
standing waves.
And you see the shapes,

342
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:04,428
and you saw the,
the mode of operation,

343
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:07,564
very characteristic for
standing waves.

344
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:10,371
When I pluck a string,
of a violin,

345
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:13,92
or I strike it with a bow,
or with a hammer,

346
00:22:13,92 --> 00:22:18,625
on a piano, just a hammer comes
down, that is exposing the

347
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,596
string to a whole set of
frequencies.

348
00:22:21,596 --> 00:22:25,558
And so the string,
now, decided which frequencies

349
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,629
it like to oscillate in.
And so it selects these

350
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:33,978
resonance frequencies.
And so if the string has a

351
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,885
fundamental of four hundred
Hertz, then it would start to

352
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:40,955
resonate at four hundred,
but simultaneously,

353
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:44,165
it will be very happy with
eight hundred Hertz,

354
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:47,793
and with twelve hundred Hertz.
And so the string will

355
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:50,863
simultaneously -- if I bang it,
or strike it,

356
00:22:50,863 --> 00:22:54,91
or pluck it -- simultaneously
oscillate, often at more than

357
00:22:54,91 --> 00:22:56,724
one frequency.
Fundamental,

358
00:22:56,724 --> 00:23:00,491
and several of the higher
harmonics.

359
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:04,577
And all the others that are
present, all the other

360
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:08,079
frequencies in this  striking
with the bow,

361
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,664
I ignore, they're off
resonance.

362
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:15,333
So if you design a string
instrument, then this is really

363
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,584
a key equation.
If you want a particular

364
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:23,087
fundamental -- say your
fundamental is four hundred and

365
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:25,838
forty, and this is a given
number.

366
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:31,174
And so N is one.
You can now manipulate V,

367
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:34,741
because V depends on the
tension on the string,

368
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:38,307
and it depends on what kind of
string you have.

369
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:43,114
The speed in the string is the
square root of the tension -- if

370
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:47,223
you take eight oh three,
you will even see a proof for

371
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:51,797
that -- divided by the mass of
the string per unit length of

372
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,976
the string.
So you take four strings for a

373
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:59,472
violin -- six for a guitar --
and you make them out of very

374
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:04,061
different material --
different mass per unit length

375
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:07,356
-- and so that gives you,
then, difference velocities --

376
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:10,891
you can also fool around with
the tension -- and so the four

377
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:13,108
strings, then,
have all four different

378
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,666
fundamental.
In the violin,

379
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:18,081
they may have the same length.
What are going to do now to

380
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,657
play the violin?
All that is left over is L,

381
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:23,892
that's the only thing you can
change, and that's what a

382
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:26,289
violinist is doing.
Goes with the finger,

383
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:29,285
back and forth over the
strings, make them shorter,

384
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:31,202
pitch goes up,
frequency goes up,

385
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:34,78
makes them longer,
frequency goes down.

386
00:24:34,78 --> 00:24:38,206
And you do the same with a
guitar, and you do the same with

387
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:40,924
the bass and the cello.
So when you're playing,

388
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:44,409
what you're doing all the time
is changing L so that you get

389
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:47,127
all these frequencies that you
want to produce.

390
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:49,785
If you take your instrument out
of the closet,

391
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:53,153
you may have noticed that it's
really not in tune anymore,

392
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:56,047
it's slightly off-tune.
Well, what you can do now,

393
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:59,651
you can change V a little bit
-- uh, these little knobs -- and

394
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:03,195
you can change the tension in
the strings.

395
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:06,251
And that's what violinists do
when they tune their violin,

396
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:09,361
they change the tension on the
string to get just the right

397
00:25:09,361 --> 00:25:11,237
frequency.
But the playing means you

398
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:12,845
change L.
A piano is different,

399
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,686
that's really a luxury.
A piano has eighty eight keys,

400
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:18,152
and the length of each set of
strings is fixed,

401
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:20,136
so you don't have to worry
about that.

402
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:21,959
It's a great luxury,
you may think,

403
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:25,068
therefore, that it is much
easier to play the piano that to

404
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:27,32
play a violin,
because you don't have to do

405
00:25:27,32 --> 00:25:29,732
this all the time,
and be exactly at the right

406
00:25:29,732 --> 00:25:31,126
length.
Well, that is true,

407
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:35,146
of course, but given the fact
that you have eighty

408
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:39,111
eight keys, you can imagine you
can hit occasionally the wrong

409
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:41,256
key, and that's not what you
want.

410
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:44,506
If a string is vibrating,
it is pushing on the air,

411
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:48,34
and it's pulling on the air,
and it's producing thereby what

412
00:25:48,34 --> 00:25:51,33
we call pressure waves.
If I have a string that

413
00:25:51,33 --> 00:25:54,97
oscillates four hundred Hertz,
it makes pressure waves --

414
00:25:54,97 --> 00:25:57,049
pressure goes up,
down, up, down,

415
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:00,429
up, down -- four hundred times
per second it goes up,

416
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:03,679
it reaches your eardrum,
and your eardrum starts to

417
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,253
shake four hundred times per
second,

418
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:09,781
it goes back and forth,
and your brain say,

419
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:12,068
"I hear sound.
That's the way it works.

420
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:14,535
So it is the string,
then you get the air,

421
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:17,243
pressure waves,
and then you get your eardrum,

422
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,891
and then you get to brains,
if there are any.

423
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:23,442
Now, I want to discuss with you
before I demonstrate some of

424
00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:27,052
this, I want to discuss with you
instruments which don't have

425
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,302
strings, and I will call them
all woodwind instruments,

426
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:33,732
although that's perhaps not an
appropriate name for all of

427
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:35,417
them.
But I'll just call them

428
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,778
woodwinds
for now.

429
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:40,975
And suppose I have,
here, a box which is filled

430
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:43,13
with air.
Completely closed box,

431
00:26:43,13 --> 00:26:45,979
and it has a length L.
And I put in here a

432
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:50,079
loudspeaker, and I generate a
particular frequency of sound.

433
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:54,249
Then pressure waves are going
to run, they're going to bounce

434
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,933
off, and they come back,
and I get reflected traveling

435
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:00,295
waves.
And what I get inside the --

436
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:03,145
the box, now,
I get standing waves of air.

437
00:27:03,145 --> 00:27:06,759
It's not the box that goes into
a standing resonance,

438
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,373
but it's the air itself.
And the

439
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:14,213
frequencies that are produced,
at which the system is in

440
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:17,564
resonance, is given exactly by
the same equation.

441
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:20,427
Except, now,
that V is non-negotiable -- V

442
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:24,127
is now the speed of sound,
which, at room temperature,

443
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:27,618
is about three hundred and
forty meters per second.

444
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:31,598
So whenever you design an --
wi- we- woodwind instruments,

445
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:34,6
that is non-negotiable.
You cannot change V,

446
00:27:34,6 --> 00:27:38,301
which you can do when you are
an instrument builder of

447
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:40,942
strings.
You will say,

448
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:44,938
"Gee, if I have an instrument
whereby the sound is inside a

449
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:48,589
closed box, you're not going to
hear very much." Well,

450
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:51,414
that's true.
You must let the sound go out

451
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:53,549
somehow.
And what is surprising,

452
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,683
that if you take this end out
-- off -- and you take this end

453
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,714
off, that this box,
which is now open on both

454
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:04,503
sides, will still resonate at
exactly those frequencies.

455
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:08,637
And you've got to take eight oh
three to get to the bottom of

456
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:11,914
this.
There are also resonant

457
00:28:11,914 --> 00:28:16,328
frequencies in case that the
sound cavity -- if I call this a

458
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:20,448
sound cavity -- is closed in one
end and open on one end.

459
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:24,2
The series of resonant
frequencies is different from

460
00:28:24,2 --> 00:28:27,069
this one, though.
It's not so important,

461
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:30,821
but it is different.
But you also get a whole series

462
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:34,941
of resonance frequencies.
The velocity of sound in a gas,

463
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:40,385
V, is the square root of the
temperature -- so it's a little

464
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,511
temperature-dependent --
divided by the molecular weight.

465
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:46,86
Well, you can't do much about
the temperature in a room -- in

466
00:28:46,86 --> 00:28:49,428
general, it's room temperature
-- and with air,

467
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,605
you are stuck with the
molecular weight,

468
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,786
oxygen and nitrogen is about
thirty, there is not much you

469
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:57,466
can do about that.
But every one of you who plays

470
00:28:57,466 --> 00:29:00,871
woodwind instruments know that
if you go from a cold room to a

471
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,717
warm room that your instrument
is no longer in tune.

472
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:06,508
And that's because of this,
the temperature change.

473
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:08,797
So V changes,
so your fundamentals change.

474
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:13,201
And what do you do know?
These people know what they do.

475
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,68
They have a way of making the
cavity a little shorter or a

476
00:29:16,68 --> 00:29:18,694
little longer.
It's not very much,

477
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:21,075
but they have a little bit to
play with.

478
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:24,127
And when they do that,
so they compensate L for the

479
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:27,606
slight difference in V to get
back to the same fundamental

480
00:29:27,606 --> 00:29:30,109
that they need.
So now you have a woodwind

481
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,123
instrument.
Low-frequency woodwind

482
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:35,236
instruments will be big.
And high-frequency woodwind

483
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:38,594
instruments will be small,
because in L lies the secret,

484
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:42,575
you can't fool around with V,
V is a God-given.

485
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:44,906
And so how do you play an
instrument now?

486
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:47,644
Well, you have to change,
that's all you can do.

487
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:50,266
And if you have a trombone,
you're doing this,

488
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:53,82
it's clear that you're changing
L, you make the cavity shorter

489
00:29:53,82 --> 00:29:55,335
and longer.
So that's easy.

490
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,131
If you have a flute,
you have holes in the flute.

491
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,336
And if all the holes are
closed, the flute is this long.

492
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:03,783
But if you take your fingers
off the holes,

493
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:06,405
it gets shorter.
And so when you take all your

494
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:09,435
fingers off the holes,
then you have a high frequency

495
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:14,526
-- flute is only this long,
if you put all your fingers on

496
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:18,18
it, it's this long,
and so the frequency is lower.

497
00:30:18,18 --> 00:30:22,803
And a trumpet is the same idea.
You have valves that open holes

498
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:25,562
and close holes.
If you blow air in an

499
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:30,11
instrument, it is like plucking
a string, it's like exciting a

500
00:30:30,11 --> 00:30:33,167
string with a bow,
you are dumping a whole

501
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,448
spectrum of frequencies onto
that air cavity.

502
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:40,176
And you let the air cavity
decide where it wants to

503
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:43,925
resonate.
And it will pick out the ones

504
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,134
that it likes,
it will pick out the

505
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:49,772
fundamental, and maybe the
second and the third harmonic.

506
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:52,891
So in that sense,
blowing air is like striking it

507
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:55,879
with a bow, in the case of a
string instrument.

508
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:59,778
But blowing air is not always
as easy as you may think it is.

509
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:02,766
Have you ever tried to blow air
into a trumpet?

510
00:31:02,766 --> 00:31:04,715
Nothing happens.
You just blow,

511
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:07,964
[pffff], and you hear nothing.
You have to do this.

512
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:09,913
[ppppppp].
Something like that.

513
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:13,356
A bizarre sound you have to
make,

514
00:31:13,356 --> 00:31:17,62
you have to know how to spit in
the instrument just the right

515
00:31:17,62 --> 00:31:21,458
way to get a sound out of it.
I've tried it many times,

516
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:25,082
it's really not easy.
So blowing air is just said in

517
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:28,138
a simple way,
but in order to get it exc- to

518
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:32,188
resonate, you've got to really
know how to hold your lips,

519
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:35,955
and how to excite that cavity.
I can show you the easy

520
00:31:35,955 --> 00:31:39,934
relation between the frequency
of the fundamental and the

521
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:44,34
length of woodwind instruments.
That's a one-to-one correlation

522
00:31:44,34 --> 00:31:46,825
--
this is on the web,

523
00:31:46,825 --> 00:31:49,81
you can download it,
you don't have to copy this --

524
00:31:49,81 --> 00:31:52,915
and you see there that,
uh, this is only for an open,

525
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,363
open system,
this is not for a closed open

526
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,572
system.
The number would be different.

527
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:00,498
So if you are interested in
very high frequencies,

528
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:03,901
then an open open system which
is only one centimeter long

529
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:07,245
would give you a fundamental of
seventeen thousand Hertz,

530
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:10,469
which most of you can hear,
because you're still young,

531
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:13,156
you can hear up to twenty
kiloHertz, probably.

532
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:17,327
The second harmonic you
would not be able to hear,

533
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:20,473
that is too high for you.
An instrument which is ten

534
00:32:20,473 --> 00:32:23,311
centimeters long,
open open, you would here the

535
00:32:23,311 --> 00:32:25,964
fundamental easily,
seventeen hundred Hertz,

536
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:28,555
second harmonic,
thirty four hundred Hertz,

537
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:31,207
no problem, third harmonic,
fourth harmonic,

538
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,551
no problem.
And then when you go to the

539
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,574
very low frequencies,
uh, organ pipes that produce

540
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:39,597
fundamentals in the range twenty
and thirty Hertz,

541
00:32:39,597 --> 00:32:42,002
are huge in size.
And you -- in general,

542
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,161
that holds.
When you have a woodwind

543
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:47,647
instrument
which is tunes for low

544
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:50,877
frequencies, it's big.
And for high frequencies,

545
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:52,527
like a flute,
it's small.

546
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:55,894
In a way, that's also true for
string instruments.

547
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:59,261
A bass which generates low
frequencies, it's a big

548
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:01,048
instrument.
But the violin,

549
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:04,484
which generates high
frequencies, is a much shorter

550
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,408
instrument.
So in that sense,

551
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:09,088
the reason it,
they have both an L here.

552
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:12,112
And it's the L,
of course, that is crucial in

553
00:33:12,112 --> 00:33:16,647
terms of the fundamental.
So I can now ge- uh,

554
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:24,131
demonstrate to you the basic
idea of a flute -- this is a

555
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:28,675
flute.
Now, the flute is this long.

556
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:32,417
[plays flute].
Low frequency.

557
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:36,56
[plays flute].
Higher frequency,

558
00:33:36,56 --> 00:33:41,238
because it's shorter.
[plays flute].

559
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:46,984
Even higher frequency,
because it's shorter.

560
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:55,154
[plays flute].
That's all it takes.

561
00:33:55,154 --> 00:33:59,715
[applause].
Trombone.

562
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:06,328
That speaks for itself,
right?

563
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:14,31
Make it longer,
you make it shorter.

564
00:34:14,31 --> 00:34:23,204
I'll try it.
[plays trombone] [applause]

565
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:27,765
Trombone.
[applause].

566
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:34,376
Wind organ.
Eighty centimeters long.

567
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:35,969
Open and open,
on both sides.

568
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:38,757
Eighty centimeters,
it would give me a fundamental

569
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:41,146
a little higher than a hundred
and seventy.

570
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,536
And then it will give me a
second harmonic,

571
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:46,437
and a third harmonic,
it all depends on how fast the

572
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:49,168
air is flowing by,
and there will be moments that

573
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:51,216
you will hear more than one
harmonic.

574
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:54,573
I'll try to swing it around.
It's not easy for me to hit the

575
00:34:54,573 --> 00:34:56,564
fundamental, but I'll try that,
too.

576
00:34:56,564 --> 00:34:59,238
This is the second harmonic.
[plays wind organ].

577
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:01,741
Third harmonic.
[wind organ] Fourth harmonic.

578
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:07,346
[wind organ] Fifth harmonic.
[wind organ] Fourth.

579
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:13,035
[wind organ] Furdamen-,
this is fundamental.

580
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:20,313
[wind organ] This is the
fundamental, two hundred twelve

581
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:24,944
Hertz.
[wind organ] Four twenty-five

582
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:29,707
Hertz.
[wind organ] Six thirty seven,

583
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:35
six thirty seven.
[wind organ]

584
00:35:35 --> 00:35:38,762
[applause] Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

585
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:43,599
If you bang on a tuning fork,
or you pluck on a string,

586
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,287
in isolation,
you hear nothing,

587
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:49,959
almost nothing.
I have here a tuning fork,

588
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:53,274
and if I bang on it,
you hear nothing,

589
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:56,499
and I hear nothing -- almost
nothing.

590
00:35:56,499 --> 00:36:00,351
Unless I heel- hold it very
close to my ear.

591
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:05,277
What we do now,
with string instruments,

592
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:08,023
we mount the strings on a box
with air.

593
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:10,696
A sound cavity.
Sound- sounding board,

594
00:36:10,696 --> 00:36:13,658
it's called.
And now the air inside can s-

595
00:36:13,658 --> 00:36:18,065
oscillate with it -- it doesn't
always have to be precisely at

596
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:21,749
resonance -- and also,
the surface itself of the box

597
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:25,433
can start to vibrate.
So you're displacing more air,

598
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,034
and the sound becomes loud and
clear.

599
00:36:28,034 --> 00:36:31,863
You don't gain energy,
but you drain the energy out of

600
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:37,856
the oscillating string faster,
and so for that short amount of

601
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:42,464
time, you get louder sound.
And I will demonstrate that,

602
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:46,82
first, with the tuning fork.
I hear it now very well,

603
00:36:46,82 --> 00:36:50,59
it's harder for you because
it's farther away.

604
00:36:50,59 --> 00:36:54,025
Now you hear nothing.
And now you hear it.

605
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:58,968
It can actually be much better
demonstrated with this little

606
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:02,99
music box that I bought years
ago in Switzerland.

607
00:37:02,99 --> 00:37:08,772
If I rotate this music box,
it has a very romantic tune,

608
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:11,875
you hear nothing.
I hear a little bit.

609
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,48
And now I put it on this box ,
unmistakable.

610
00:37:15,48 --> 00:37:18,582
So that's the idea of sounding
boards.

611
00:37:18,582 --> 00:37:22,439
You have them violins,
you have them on pianos,

612
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:26,045
and, of course,
the design of these sounding

613
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:30,237
boards is top-secret,
the manufacturer is not going

614
00:37:30,237 --> 00:37:35,1
to tell you how they built them,
because the quality of the

615
00:37:35,1 --> 00:37:39,88
sound, of course,
is partly in the

616
00:37:39,88 --> 00:37:44,178
design of the sounding board.
I can make you hear,

617
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:49,266
and I can make you see sound.
And my goal for the remaining

618
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:53,565
time is to make you see and hear
at the same time.

619
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:58,126
I have here a microphone,
which is like your eardrum,

620
00:37:58,126 --> 00:38:02,6
and suppose I generate four
hundred and forty Hertz,

621
00:38:02,6 --> 00:38:05,934
and I can do that with the
tuning fork.

622
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:12,514
So here is the amplitude of the
oscillation of the membrane in

623
00:38:12,514 --> 00:38:15,328
the microphone,
which is your eardrum,

624
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:18,523
say, we amplify that,
and we show you on an

625
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:20,805
oscilloscope,
the current after

626
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:24,001
amplification.
And so you're going to see a

627
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,652
signal like this.
And if this is four hundred and

628
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:32,216
forty Hertz, so this is time,
and this is the displacement of

629
00:38:32,216 --> 00:38:35,716
your eardrum -- in our case,
it's a microphone,

630
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:40,128
it's really a current after
amplification -- and if this is

631
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:45,619
four hundred and forty Hertz,
then this time T will be about

632
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:49,602
two point three milliseconds.
One divided by four hundred and

633
00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:51,593
forty.
That's no problem for an

634
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:54,182
oscilloscope.
We can do much better than

635
00:38:54,182 --> 00:38:56,572
that.
So the time resolution is not a

636
00:38:56,572 --> 00:38:58,962
problem.
And so I will show you there

637
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,879
the output of our microphone,
I will show you this signal as

638
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:05,866
a function of time.
For four hundred and forty

639
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:09,915
Hertz, you see a boring signal.
And I can make a boring signal

640
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:12,902
with a tuning fork,
it's almost a pure sine of

641
00:39:12,902 --> 00:39:16,554
sorts.
But now, it just so happens,

642
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,129
we have in our audie- in our
audience, someone who can play

643
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:22,471
the violin.
And that person is going to

644
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:24,814
produce a four hundred and forty
Hertz.

645
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:27,958
But at the same time,
he's going to produce a second

646
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:31,348
harmonic, and maybe a third
harmonic, and maybe a fourth

647
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:33,136
harmonic.
And so, imagine now,

648
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:36,465
that at th- simultaneously,
your eardrum is going to do

649
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:39,793
this, but at the same time,
your eardrum is going to do

650
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:42,382
this, because this is some
higher harmonic.

651
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:45,711
Then the net result is that
your eardrum is going to do

652
00:39:45,711 --> 00:39:47,807
this.
And that is what I'm going to

653
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:49,731
show
you.

654
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:53,75
And so when you see the various
instruments, you will recognize

655
00:39:53,75 --> 00:39:57,25
that on top of the fundamental,
you will see these very

656
00:39:57,25 --> 00:40:00,816
characteristic harmonics,
each instrument having its own

657
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:04,511
cocktail, it's own unique
cocktail, and when you hear that

658
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:07,557
cocktail, you say,
"Oh, yes, that's a saxophone.

659
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:09,632
Or you say, "No,
that's a violin.

660
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:12,808
You would never mistaken a
saxophone for a violin.

661
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:16,049
And that's because of the
combination of the higher

662
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:19,614
harmonics.
And so we are so fortunate

663
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:23,285
that we have four musicians in
our audience.

664
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:26,785
Tom, who is the violinist --
where is Tom?

665
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:28,748
There's Tom.
[applause].

666
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:32,077
I hope you brought your violin
[laughs].

667
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:36,516
Oh, you got it there.
And then we have Emily -- I saw

668
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:41,382
her already, with the clarinet
-- so if you come this way,

669
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:45,394
Emily [applause].
And we have Aaron -- Aaron has

670
00:40:45,394 --> 00:40:50,088
a bassoon.
You may never have a bassoon.

671
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:56,364
A bassoon is an instrument that
produces a very low tone.

672
00:40:56,364 --> 00:41:00,959
So the instrument is going to
be very big.

673
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,545
Bigger than -- bigger than
Aaron.

674
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:10,036
Just wait and see.
Beauty, it's a really beautiful

675
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:14,071
instrument.
A flute is only this big.

676
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,657
Ah, look at that,
beautiful, big,

677
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:22,277
bassoon.
And then we have Fabian,

678
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:24,922
with a saxophone.
[applause].

679
00:41:24,922 --> 00:41:29,834
So if you stand here,
then I will first do the boring

680
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,896
part, and what I will do is I
will show you,

681
00:41:33,896 --> 00:41:39,468
then, what a four-hundred and
forty Hertz signal looks like,

682
00:41:39,468 --> 00:41:44,475
produced with a tuning fork --
and we'll see it there,

683
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:51,086
and so I have to change the
light situation substantially.

684
00:41:51,086 --> 00:41:56,572
[unintelligible] the musicians
will get a little bit into the

685
00:41:56,572 --> 00:42:00,595
dark, but you will still be able
to see them.

686
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:04,984
And so I'm going to turn on,
now, the microphone,

687
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:09,281
and that's where you're going
to see the signal,

688
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:14,035
and when you make noise,
you can hear -- hear and see

689
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:15,863
yourself.
Four forty.

690
00:42:15,863 --> 00:42:19,521
Boring, and no signs of higher
harmonics.

691
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:26,531
Now Tom will try to produce
four-forty in his violin -- or

692
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:32,978
close to four-forty -- and then
look for the higher harmonics,

693
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:36,888
which makes the violin
characteristic.

694
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,904
[plays violin].
Notice that the average

695
00:42:40,904 --> 00:42:46,612
spacing, the repetition,
is, indeed, the same as it was

696
00:42:46,612 --> 00:42:51,579
with the four forty,
but you saw this incredible

697
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:57,263
richness
of harmonics.

698
00:42:57,263 --> 00:43:09,074
Tom happens to be,
also, an excellent violin

699
00:43:09,074 --> 00:43:23,082
player, and so he insisted that
he demonstrate that.

700
00:43:23,082 --> 00:43:29,949
[laughter] All right,
Tom?

701
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:35,992
Student: All right.
OK.

702
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:42,584
Go ahead.
[plays violin].

703
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:53,021
Terrific, Tom.
[applause].

704
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:58,408
Emily, would you mind producing
something that comes close to

705
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:03,435
four hundred and forty Hertz?
Come a little closer to the

706
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:05,949
microphone.
[plays clarinet].

707
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:09,63
Notice the big difference with
the violin.

708
00:44:09,63 --> 00:44:13,041
Violin has many,
many higher harmonics.

709
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,734
Her instrument,
maybe only one,

710
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:20,223
maybe only the fundamental and
the second harmonic.

711
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:23,365
Can you try again?
[plays clarinet].

712
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:26,418
Now we have more,
now we have more.

713
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:33,558
[plays clarinet].
Now, Emily did not insist that

714
00:44:33,558 --> 00:44:37,335
she wanted to play,
but I did.

715
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:43,067
So Emily, would you please?
[plays clarinet].

716
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:45,933
Impressive.
[applause].

717
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:52,576
Aaron, with his bassoon.
He ordered a special chair,

718
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:58,308
because he says,
"Look, with an instrument so

719
00:44:58,308 --> 00:45:01,594
big,
L is so large,

720
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:05,629
it's heavy." Clearly,
a bass, which produces low

721
00:45:05,629 --> 00:45:10,607
frequencies, is heavier that a
violin, and the same is true

722
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:15,414
with woodwind instruments.
Aaron, could you try something

723
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:18,505
close to four-forty?
[plays bassoon].

724
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:21,252
Bizarre instrument,
isn't it, eh?

725
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:26,488
You see a weird combination of
probably fundamental and second

726
00:45:26,488 --> 00:45:29,75
harmonic.
Aaron, would you mind showing

727
00:45:29,75 --> 00:45:44,667
some of your expertise?
This is a wonderful instrument.

728
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:58,103
You don't see them too often,
do you?

729
00:45:58,103 --> 00:46:07,433
[plays bassoon].
Terrific.

730
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:18,63
[applause].
Last, but --

731
00:46:18,63 --> 00:46:20,771
but not least,
we have a saxophone,

732
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:22,976
Fabian.
Now, you may have to stand a

733
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:26,001
long distance from this
microphone, because these

734
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:29,34
instruments make a hell of a lot
of noise, don't they?

735
00:46:29,34 --> 00:46:31,67
So give it a shot,
and try four-forty,

736
00:46:31,67 --> 00:46:34,82
or come close to that.
It doesn't have to be exact.

737
00:46:34,82 --> 00:46:36,71
[plays saxophone].
Interesting.

738
00:46:36,71 --> 00:46:40,427
Also, you see several higher
harmonics, it's hard to s- hard

739
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:42,255
to tell which.
Would you mind,

740
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:45,972
uh, playing something real hot?
[laughter] [plays saxophone]

741
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:49,5
[unintelligible] [laughter]
[noise]

742
00:46:49,5 --> 00:46:57,08
If you think we're interested
in hearing it,

743
00:46:57,08 --> 00:47:02,546
you're wrong,
we want to see it!

744
00:47:02,546 --> 00:47:12,419
[laughter] [plays saxophone].
[unintelligible] [laughter]

745
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:20
[unintelligible].
[plays saxophone].

746
00:47:20 --> 00:47:22,78
[applause].
Thank all of them.

747
00:47:22,78 --> 00:47:28,533
[applause] Thank you very much.
[applause] So during the last

748
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:32,56
three minutes,
I would like to discuss with

749
00:47:32,56 --> 00:47:37,354
you the speed of sound in a
little bit more detail.

750
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:43,107
Uh, you notice that the speed
of sound is the -- proportional

751
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:47,422
with the temperature and the
molecular weight.

752
00:47:47,422 --> 00:47:51,833
[unintelligible] few other
things

753
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:55,205
upstairs here.
But these are the -- these are

754
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:59,038
the major contributors.
So I should really say it's

755
00:47:59,038 --> 00:48:01,874
proportional.
If you take air -- as we

756
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:05,324
discussed earlier,
molecular weight is thirty,

757
00:48:05,324 --> 00:48:08,85
that's a God-given,
there's not much you can do

758
00:48:08,85 --> 00:48:11,839
about it.
I would like to demonstrate to

759
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,829
you, the dependence on molecular
weight.

760
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:19,351
And one way I could do that,
I could take all the air out of

761
00:48:19,351 --> 00:48:23,184
twenty six one hundred,
and replace it with helium.

762
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:26,44
And
then I would ask the same

763
00:48:26,44 --> 00:48:28,888
musicians to come,
and I would ask them,

764
00:48:28,888 --> 00:48:31,148
then, to play their wind
instruments.

765
00:48:31,148 --> 00:48:33,848
The Ls are fixed,
there's nothing you can do

766
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:36,359
about it.
So their instruments don't know

767
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:39,874
that I put helium in the
audience, so the only thing that

768
00:48:39,874 --> 00:48:42,636
changes is V.
The speed would go up by almost

769
00:48:42,636 --> 00:48:45,712
a factor of three,
and so the fundamental would be

770
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:49,04
free -- three times higher.
And the harmonics would be

771
00:48:49,04 --> 00:48:52,053
three times higher.
So you would hear much higher

772
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:56,07
frequencies.
And you wouldn't even recognize

773
00:48:56,07 --> 00:48:59,46
these instruments.
This wouldn't be very

774
00:48:59,46 --> 00:49:02,762
practical.
I cannot take the air out of

775
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:07,107
twenty six one hundred,
and replace it with helium.

776
00:49:07,107 --> 00:49:11,366
But what I can do,
as I have done so often here in

777
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:15,798
twenty six one hundred,
I can suffer myself -- I can

778
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:18,839
suffer, and put helium in my
system.

779
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:23,098
I have, here -- I have,
here, my own sound cavity.

780
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:27,791
I am, in a way,
like a wind instrument.

781
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:32,022
And, um, if I swallow helium,
my sound cavity doesn't know

782
00:49:32,022 --> 00:49:35,215
that I'm producing helium.
And you will say,

783
00:49:35,215 --> 00:49:38,333
when I talk to you as I do
right now, "Yes,

784
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:41,303
that's typical,
that's Walter Lewin." You

785
00:49:41,303 --> 00:49:45,238
recognize my fundamentals,
you recognize my harmonics,

786
00:49:45,238 --> 00:49:49,544
and it's unique for my voice.
And so you will recognize me.

787
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:53,108
But the moment that I fill my
system with helium,

788
00:49:53,108 --> 00:49:56,449
nothing is changing in my
system except for V.

789
00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:00,086
And so the frequency will go
up.

790
00:50:00,086 --> 00:50:03,183
And that will be noticeable.
And, in fact,

791
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:07,563
change are that you will say,
"Hm, that's really not Walter

792
00:50:07,563 --> 00:50:11,565
Lewin any more." There's only
one problem with helium.

793
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:14,586
And that is there is no oxygen
in helium.

794
00:50:14,586 --> 00:50:17,531
And that is also very
noticeable for me.

795
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:21,912
And yet, I really have to fill
my lungs with helium all the

796
00:50:21,912 --> 00:50:24,479
way, and so I will be,
for a while,

797
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,802
without oxygen,
and, um, so you may catch two

798
00:50:27,802 --> 00:50:33,088
birds with one stone.
You may [unintelligible] hear a

799
00:50:33,088 --> 00:50:36,609
strange frequency,
and you see me on the floor.

800
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:39,899
So I'll really try not to fall
on the floor,

801
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:41,506
then.
OK, there we go.

802
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:44,414
[laughter].
And it really doesn't sound

803
00:50:44,414 --> 00:50:47,092
like Walter Lewin any more,
does it?

804
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:49,77
I will see you Friday.
All the best.

805
00:50:49,77 --> 50:55
[applause].
Whew.
