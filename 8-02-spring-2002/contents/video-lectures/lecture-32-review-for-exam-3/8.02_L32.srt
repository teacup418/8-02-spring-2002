1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,599



2
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,453
These are the subjects will be
covered during our third exam.

3
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:09,418
There's no way I can cover all
during this review.

4
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:13,706
Nor can I cover all of them of
course during the exam.

5
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:16,538
I can only touch upon a few of
them.

6
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:21,231
And what I cannot cover today,
what I will not cover today,

7
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:25,762
can and will be on the exam.
Let's first look at magnetic

8
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:28,675
materials.
Magnetic materials come in

9
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:32,072
dia-,
para- and ferromagnetic

10
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:35,165
materials.
The molecules and the atoms in

11
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:38,799
para- and ferromagnetic
materials have intrinsic

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,82
magnetic dipole moments.
These have always -- they're

13
00:00:42,82 --> 00:00:45,758
always a multiple of the Bohr
magneton.

14
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:48,232
Has to do with quantum
mechanics.

15
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:52,407
It's not part of eight oh two.
And they are going to be

16
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:56,66
aligned by the external field,
I call that um the vacuum

17
00:00:56,66 --> 00:01:00,371
field.
And the degree of success

18
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:04,848
depends on the temperature and
on the strength of that external

19
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:07,374
field.
The lower the temperature the

20
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:10,984
easier it is to align them,
to overcome the thermal

21
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:13,944
agitation.
And above a certain temperature

22
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:17,409
which we call the Curie
temperature, ferromagnet-

23
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:21,163
magnetic material loses all its
qualities and becomes

24
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:24,773
paramagnetic and I have
demonstrated that during my

25
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:27,589
lectures.
Suppose we have a solenoid and

26
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:33,229
the solenoid has N windings,
and the length of the solenoid

27
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,859
is N.
And the current I is flowing

28
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,366
through the solenoid.
Then the magnetic field

29
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:44,387
generated by that solenoid which
I have called the vacuum field,

30
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:48,612
that magnetic field can be
derived using Ampere's law,

31
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:51,162
which you see down -- down
there.

32
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:55,227
That magnetic field is
approximately mu zero times I

33
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:58,495
times N divided by L.
If now I put in here

34
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:02,48
ferromagnetic material then I
have

35
00:02:02,48 --> 00:02:06,333
to include this factor kappa of
M or K of M, whatever you want

36
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,669
to call it.
The magnetic permeability,

37
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,006
and this can be huge.
This can be ten,

38
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,722
a hundred, even up to a
thousand and higher.

39
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:17,384
So you get an enormous increase
in magnetic field strength.

40
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:20,984
Self-inductance is defined as
magnetic flux divided by the

41
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:23,447
current I.
That's just the definition of

42
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:26,289
self-inductance.
If the magnetic field goes up

43
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:30,204
by a factor of kappa M then of
course the magnetic flux will go

44
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:33,459
up by the same
factor and so the

45
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,833
self-inductance will go up.
And you may remember a

46
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:41,033
demonstration that I did when I
had an iron core which I moved

47
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:44,682
inside the solenoid and
depending upon how far I moved

48
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:48,745
it in could we see that the
self-inductance went up and when

49
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:51,981
I pulled it out self-inductance
went down again.

50
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:56,25
We have an interesting problem.
I think it is assignment seven,

51
00:02:56,25 --> 00:03:00,312
whereby we have iron core here
and then we have somewhere an

52
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:04,099
air gap and you may want to
revisit that to refresh your

53
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,625
memory.
Let's now turn to transformers.

54
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,153
A transformer often comes in
this shape.

55
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:15,771
Let me move it a little bit to
the right.

56
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:21,38
Often comes in this shape which
is then ferromagnetic material,

57
00:03:21,38 --> 00:03:26,175
to give coupling between the
left and the right sides,

58
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:29,16
also increases the magnetic
field.

59
00:03:29,16 --> 00:03:33,05
This is the -- let's call this
primary side.

60
00:03:33,05 --> 00:03:38,722
N one windings,
index um self-inductance L one.

61
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:44,426
And here I put in a voltmeter
to always monitor that value,

62
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:49,246
I call that V one.
And this is the secondary side.

63
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:52,884
N two windings.
Self-inductance L two.

64
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:57,999
And I put here a voltmeter
which always monitors that

65
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:01,244
voltage and I call that one V
two.

66
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:07,145
You can show with Faraday's law
as I did in class in lectures

67
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:13,499
that V two divided by V one,
let's not worry about plus or

68
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:16,412
minus signs, is N two divided by
N one.

69
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:20,322
That's a good approximation.
Depends on how well the

70
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:23,696
coupling goes.
It depends on several factors,

71
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:28,449
but you can come very close to
this and this means then that if

72
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,356
you make N two larger than N one
then you can step up in voltage,

73
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,963
we call that a step-up
transformer.

74
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:40,409
But you can also step down if
you make N two smaller than N

75
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:42,939
one.
Under very special conditions

76
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:48,389
will the power generated
on the primary side be all

77
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:53,534
consumed for a hundred percent
or nearly a hundred percent on

78
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:57,393
the secondary side.
That is very very special.

79
00:04:57,393 --> 00:05:02,452
If that's the case then the
time averaged power here V one I

80
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:06,653
one is the same as V two I two
here time averaged.

81
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:11,884
And so as a logical consequence
of that you'll find that I two

82
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:15,657
divided by I one,
let's not worry about minus

83
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:19,895
signs, is that N
one divided by N two.

84
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:23,386
That however is not so easy as
you may think.

85
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:28,304
It only can work approximately
and I mentioned that on the side

86
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:31,874
in my lectures.
If the resistance here and the

87
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:36,555
resistance there is way way
smaller than the value for omega

88
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:39,093
L.
And we did try to achieve that

89
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:43,218
during one of the demonstrations
that I gave on this.

90
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:48,216
I remember we had the induction
oven whereby N two was one and N

91
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:52,96
one was very large,
I don't remember what it was

92
00:05:52,96 --> 00:05:56,473
anymore but it was of the order
of several hundred,

93
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,846
maybe a thousand,
and we managed to get a current

94
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:04,272
in the secondary which was huge,
which was close to one thousand

95
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:07,013
amperes.
It was enough to melt that iron

96
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,401
nail.
And we made every effort then

97
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:13,898
to make sure that the resistance
was much much smaller than omega

98
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:16,006
L.
I think problem seven-one of

99
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:20,292
our assignments deals with that,
and very naively assumes that

100
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:26,392
this is all true.
But you should realize that it

101
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:33,188
is not always so easy to achieve
the conditions for that.

102
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:37,678
So let's now go to RLC circuits
there.

103
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:43,26
Let's take an uh system which
has a resistor R,

104
00:06:43,26 --> 00:06:48,599
it has a self-inductor,
a pure self-inductor,

105
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,39
L, and a capacitance,
C.

106
00:06:51,39 --> 00:06:55,611
AC.
And this driving power supply

107
00:06:55,611 --> 00:07:00,742
provides with a voltage V which
is V zero times cosine omega T.

108
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:05,211
Keep in mind that this can be
always be sine omega T of

109
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:08,273
course.
There is nothing special about

110
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:11,997
cosine in life.
The steady state solution that

111
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:16,632
is not when you turn the thing
on but if you wait awhile,

112
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:20,522
you get a steady state solution
for the current.

113
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:25,57
And the current that is going
to flow now is V zero divided by

114
00:07:25,57 --> 00:07:32,228
the square root of R
squared plus omega L minus one

115
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:39,34
over omega C squared times the
cosine of omega T minus phi.

116
00:07:39,34 --> 00:07:47,065
And the tangent of phi is omega
L minus one over omega C divided

117
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:50,989
by R.
We call this the reactance.

118
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:55,893
The upstairs.
For which we give often the

119
00:07:55,893 --> 00:08:00,185
symbol X.
And so this is also X then

120
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:06,23
divided by R.
And this whole square root that

121
00:08:06,23 --> 00:08:10,076
we have here,
we call that the impedance.

122
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:13,728
The units are ohms.
And we call that Z.

123
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:17,958
And so the maximum current that
you can have,

124
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:22,572
the current is of course
oscillating with angular

125
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:26,994
frequency omega,
the maximum value that you can

126
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:30,839
have for the current,
which I call I max,

127
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:38,575
is then V zero divided by Z.
Then the cosine term is either

128
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:44,494
plus or minus one.
I can plot now this I max as a

129
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:50,782
function of frequency.
So here is frequency and here

130
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:55,714
is I max.
If the frequency is very low or

131
00:08:55,714 --> 00:09:03,112
near zero then this term here
becomes infinitely high because

132
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:06,913
the
impedance is infinitely high

133
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:10,133
and so the current is zero.
I max is zero.

134
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,725
There's no current flowing at
all.

135
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:16,809
When we go to very high
frequencies it is the omega L

136
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:21,364
term that goes to infinity.
And so again Z goes to infinity

137
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:25,84
so again I max goes to zero.
And for other values of omega

138
00:09:25,84 --> 00:09:30,63
you get an I max which is not
zero and so you get a curve like

139
00:09:30,63 --> 00:09:33,929
this which has the name of
resonance curve.

140
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:37,855
This I max reaches a maximum
value

141
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:41,911
when the system is at
resonance, that's what we call

142
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:44,853
resonance.
And that's the case clearly

143
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:49,306
when the reactance is zero.
Because when the reactance is

144
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:53,361
zero this part vanishes.
And if the reactance is not

145
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:57,098
zero then the maximum current
can only be lower,

146
00:09:57,098 --> 00:10:00,676
can never be higher.
And so when X equals zero

147
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:05,686
you'll find that omega L is one
divided by omega C and so the --

148
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:09,821
the frequency for which that
happens,

149
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:14,355
I call that omega zero,
reminds me that it is the --

150
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:18,09
the resonance,
is one divided by the square

151
00:10:18,09 --> 00:10:21,38
root of LC.
When I am at resonance phi

152
00:10:21,38 --> 00:10:24,848
becomes zero.
So there is no phase delay

153
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:28,316
between current and the driving
voltage.

154
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:31,25
They are in phase with each
other.

155
00:10:31,25 --> 00:10:36,496
And the value for I max now
simply becomes V zero divided by

156
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:40,586
R.
Because the impedance itself

157
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:42,422
becomes R.
Very boring,

158
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:45,758
very simple,
you're looking here at Ohm's

159
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,843
law.
When the system is at

160
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:50,929
resonance, forget the
self-inductance,

161
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,266
forget the capacitor,
they are not there,

162
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:59,104
they annihilate each other,
and so the system behaves as if

163
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:03,942
there were only a resistor,
and that's exactly what you see

164
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:06,861
here.
I have here some numbers which

165
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:11,496
you have seen before.
During my lectures.

166
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:16,126
You can download this from the
Web but you have to go back to

167
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,672
the lecture when I discussed
that.

168
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:21,604
And you see here s- some
numbers for R,

169
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:25,924
L and C and also for V zero.
And I calculate for you here

170
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:30,091
the resonance frequency.
I calculate the frequency also

171
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:34,103
in terms of kilohertz.
And here you see the impedance

172
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:38,346
and here you see the reactance.
If I'm ten percent below

173
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:42,822
resonance notice that the one
over omega C

174
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:45,38
term is always larger than
omega L.

175
00:11:45,38 --> 00:11:49,894
So your reactance in this case
becomes minus eighty-six ohms.

176
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:54,258
The minus sign has of course no
consequence for the current

177
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:56,816
because you have an X squared
here.

178
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:01,481
But notice that Z is now almost
exclusively determined by X and

179
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:04,942
not by R anymore.
Because the ten ohms of the R

180
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,425
here play no role,
almost no role,

181
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,908
in comparison with the
eighty-six.

182
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:15,697
Z becomes eighty-seven and the
maximum current is one-tenth of

183
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:18,239
an ampere.
When you're on resonance,

184
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,363
and that is characteristic for
on resonance,

185
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:25,286
the two omega L and one over
omega C eat each other up.

186
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,645
They annihilate each other and
so the reactance becomes zero.

187
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:32,115
So Z now is just pure R.
X is zero.

188
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:35,457
And so the maximum current in
this case is one.

189
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:38,871
Because I chose V zero at ten
and I chose R ten.

190
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:43,956
And then when I'm ten percent
above resonance then the

191
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:49,2
omega L term is larger than the
reactance of the capacitor and

192
00:12:49,2 --> 00:12:52,725
accordingly you get a lower
current again,

193
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:56,077
about one-eighth of the -- of
an ampere.

194
00:12:56,077 --> 00:13:01,493
And so you see this curve being
formed in a very natural way and

195
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:05,447
that's quantitative you see
there some numbers.

196
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:10,605
So now comes the question which
of course in practice is very

197
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:13,785
important.
And that has to do with the

198
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:17,949
power
that is generated by the power

199
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,719
supply.
That power comes out in the

200
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:24,222
form of heat.
Heat in the resistor and so if

201
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:29,192
you time average the power then
the time average value you can

202
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:33,999
take the -- the voltage of the
power supply multiply that by

203
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:37,258
the current.
You could also take the time

204
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:41,902
average value of I squared R.
Because all that energy will

205
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:45,812
ultimately come out in the form
of

206
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:49,901
heat of the resistor.
Either one will be fine.

207
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:54,898
I've decided to take this one.
So I will get then V zero

208
00:13:54,898 --> 00:14:00,35
cosine omega T -- the I becomes
V zero divided by Z times the

209
00:14:00,35 --> 00:14:05,438
cosine omega T minus phi.
This is the power at any moment

210
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:08,891
in time.
I will do the time averaging a

211
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,889
little later.
When I see cosine omega T minus

212
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:17,523
phi, that reminds me of my high
school

213
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:22,723
days, cosine alpha minus cosine
-- no, cosine alpha minus beta

214
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:27,241
is cosine alpha cosine beta plus
sine alpha sine beta.

215
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,309
That was drilled into my memory
here.

216
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:33,037
I will never forget that I
think.

217
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:38,237
And so I will write down here
-- my math teacher will be proud

218
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:43,437
of me -- cosine omega T cosine
phi plus sine omega T sine phi.

219
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:47,614
So this is this term.
If I'm going to time average

220
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:52,133
it, I have a cosine omega T
multiplied

221
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:56,769
by sine omega T,
that time average is zero.

222
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:02,288
So this term vanishes.
So the time average value of

223
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:07,586
the power I get a V zero
squared, I get a Z here,

224
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:13,658
and now I have here cosine
omega T times cosine omega T.

225
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:19,177
The time average value of
cosine squared omega T is

226
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:23,702
one-half.
So I get a two here.

227
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:27,205
And then I still have my cosine
phi there.

228
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:30,879
And I'm done.
If you like to get rid of this

229
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,442
uh cosine phi,
you can do that.

230
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:37,542
Because remember,
the way that phi is defined the

231
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:41,301
tangent of phi is the reactance
divided by R.

232
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:45,829
You still see it there.
So that means if this angle is

233
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:49,161
ninety degrees that this side
must be Z.

234
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:54,799
That's the square root of X
squared plus R squared.

235
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,559
That's this part.
And so the cosine of phi is

236
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,659
also R divided by Z.
And so if you prefer that --

237
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:07,871
there's no particular advantage
but if you prefer that you can

238
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:11,288
write down for cosine phi R
divided by Z.

239
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:16,329
And so you get V zero squared
times R divided by two and now

240
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:20,515
you get Z squared.
And so there you see the power,

241
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:23,676
time averaged power in an RLC
circuit.

242
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:27,692
So now we can look at
resonance.

243
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:30,329
It's always a very special
situation.

244
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:32,967
When we are at resonance,
Z equals R.

245
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:35,458
So you replace this capital Z
by R.

246
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,049
And then you find V zero
squared divided by two R.

247
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:42,932
That's utterly trivial.
You could have predicted that.

248
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:46,229
It's really Ohm's law staring
you in the face.

249
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:50,259
There is no self-inductance and
there is no capacitor at

250
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,824
resonance.
So you might as well have

251
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:55,828
treated it as a simple system
only with R.

252
00:16:55,828 --> 00:17:00,298
And you find immediately then
that answer.

253
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:05,514
At any other frequency than
omega zero Z would always be

254
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:09,688
larger than R.
You see that immediately here.

255
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:14,904
And so that means that the
average power would always be

256
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:18,319
lower.
So it's only at resonance that

257
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,018
you generate the highest power
possible.

258
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:25,717
All right.
Let's go back to our subjects

259
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:29,511
and see what's next.
We did LRC circuits.

260
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:35,941
Oh yes, we're getting now to
traveling waves and standing

261
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:38,796
waves.
Let's start with a traveling

262
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:42,658
wave in a string.
That's always very nice to do

263
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:47,781
that because the parallel with
electromagnetic waves is nearly

264
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:51,895
a hundred percent.
I have a string that oscillates

265
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:56,01
in the Y direction.
And let's say it propagates in

266
00:17:56,01 --> 00:17:59,789
the X direction.
Y zero cosine K X minus omega

267
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,56
T.
When I see this traveling wave,

268
00:18:02,56 --> 00:18:09,152
so the traveling wave in the Y
direction and it propagates in

269
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:13,338
the X direction,
I see immediately that it goes

270
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:18,161
into the plus X direction,
because I have a minus sign

271
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:21,892
here, it tells me in the plus X
direction.

272
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:26,26
K gives me all the information
on the wavelength.

273
00:18:26,26 --> 00:18:31,538
It's two pi divided by lambda.
Omega equals two pi times F,

274
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:37,18
F being the frequency in hertz.
It would also be two pi divided

275
00:18:37,18 --> 00:18:40,547
by capital T,
capital T

276
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:45,622
now being the period of one
complete oscillation.

277
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:51,332
The speed of propagation,
the disturbance propagates in

278
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:55,35
the X direction,
is omega divided by K.

279
00:18:55,35 --> 00:19:01,271
And so if I draw here at a
particular moment in time this

280
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:07,404
string and this would be Y zero,
that would also be Y zero,

281
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:14,912
and it would propagate in this
direction with that velocity,

282
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:18,461
and this would be the
wavelength, lambda,

283
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:23,431
and that lambda is V times T.
It's immediately obvious if

284
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:28,578
something propagates with a
speed V and it has T seconds to

285
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:33,37
go for one oscillation it moves
over a distance lambda.

286
00:19:33,37 --> 00:19:37,63
That's eight oh one.
Do not confuse this speed of

287
00:19:37,63 --> 00:19:42,245
propagation with which the
disturbance moves with the

288
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:47,776
actual speed of the atoms,
of the particles in the string.

289
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:51,515
If you were a particle in the
string and you were sitting

290
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:54,053
here, you never move in this
direction.

291
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,19
That's the same with water
waves.

292
00:19:56,19 --> 00:19:59,061
If a water wave comes by all
you do is this.

293
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:02,2
You go up and down.
Your motion is only in the Y

294
00:20:02,2 --> 00:20:04,804
direction.
You go from here to there and

295
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,01
you oscillate back and forth
with that frequency,

296
00:20:08,01 --> 00:20:11,148
angular frequency omega.
And so if you're really

297
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:14,821
interested in the speed with
which you are moving up and

298
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:17,644
down,
that of course,

299
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:21,798
that speed which we call the
transverse speed is dY dT,

300
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,106
and you have to do that then
for a particular location X,

301
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:29,799
which you can choose,
wherever you want to sit on

302
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,876
that string.
And I think we had a problem

303
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:37,337
once where we asked you in the
homework what the transverse

304
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,414
speed was.
So if now move to

305
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:42,953
electromagnetic waves then very
little changes.

306
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:46,414
Uh take an electromagnetic
wave, a plain wave,

307
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:51,107
whereby the E vector
is in the Y direction,

308
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:54,728
so E is E zero,
there's the unit vector in the

309
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,704
Y direction, cosine K X minus
omega T.

310
00:20:57,704 --> 00:21:02,371
This could be a sine of course.
There is nothing special in

311
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:06,313
life with a cosine.
I come to the same conclusion.

312
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:10,496
The wave is traveling in the
plus X direction and the

313
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:15,243
velocity, speed of propagation,
is omega divided by K and if

314
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:18,622
this is vacuum which will I
assume for now,

315
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:22,644
then that is C and as we have
seen

316
00:21:22,644 --> 00:21:27,688
from Maxwell's equations C is
one divided by the square root

317
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:32,134
of epsilon zero mu zero.
Surprising as that is that's

318
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,869
comes out of Maxwell's
equations.

319
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:39,913
And so if now you were asked,
which would be a natural thing

320
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:44,102
for me to ask you,
what is the associated magnetic

321
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:48,718
field, well, the magnetic field
is perpendicular to the

322
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:53,335
direction of propagation.
It's also perpendicular to E.

323
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:58,479
And B zero is E zero divided
by C in vacuum.

324
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:03,082
And so if I make a coordinate
system, this is X,

325
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:07,88
this is Y and this is Z,
notice that my coordinate

326
00:22:07,88 --> 00:22:13,854
system always is chosen so that
X roof cross Y roof is Z roof,

327
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:18,652
this is called the right-handed
coordinate system.

328
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:23,156
If you choose any other system
you're an idiot.

329
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:27,586
You always get yourself into
trouble.

330
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:30,917
Make sure that you always
choose this as a coordinate

331
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,287
system.
And notice I have X cross Y is

332
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:36,041
Z coming out of the blackboard.
At a moment,

333
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,628
a particular moment in time,
let's say the E vector is in

334
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:41,806
this direction,
in the Y direction,

335
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:45,778
I pick a random moment in time
and I pick a random location for

336
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,892
X.
Now I must be sure that E cross

337
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:50,198
B is in the direction of
propagation.

338
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:53,721
So E cross B must be in this
case in the direction of X.

339
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:57,051
Because it's going in the plus
X

340
00:22:57,051 --> 00:23:00,469
direction.
And so my problem is solved.

341
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:04,695
I know that that can only
happen if B is in this

342
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:08,292
direction.
At this moment in time at this

343
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:11,08
location.
And that's all I need.

344
00:23:11,08 --> 00:23:15,846
Because now I can write down
that the B vector that is

345
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:21,062
associated with that electric
field is E zero divided by C,

346
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:27,537
that is the largest value that
the magnetic field can have,

347
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:31,405
times the same cosine K X minus
omega T.

348
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:36,86
And now I must have here Z roof
and now I'm in business.

349
00:23:36,86 --> 00:23:42,81
So now I have the E vector that
goes with the -- the B vector

350
00:23:42,81 --> 00:23:48,662
that goes with the E vector.
We would often be interested in

351
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:54,613
energy, how much energy per unit
area per unit time is in the

352
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:59,77
plain wave.
That is given by the pointing

353
00:23:59,77 --> 00:24:03,279
vector S which is E cross B
divided by mu zero.

354
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,093
We're still in vacuum.
I still assume that it's all

355
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:10,221
vacuum, so this is watts per
square meter.

356
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:14,95
Of course we are in general not
interested in the instantaneous

357
00:24:14,95 --> 00:24:18,764
value of the pointing vector,
who cares about that,

358
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:22,731
it oscillates like mad,
I'm more interested in a time

359
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:26,087
average value.
And so the time average value,

360
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:29,902
this has a cosine omega T,
this has

361
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:33,667
a cosine omega T,
the product average out to be

362
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:36,368
one-half of cosine square omega
T.

363
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:38,905
I get an E zero.
I get a B zero.

364
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:42,998
And I get a mu zero.
And if now you want to get rid

365
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:48,072
of your B zero because you want
to get everything in terms of E

366
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:52,247
zero, you can replace B zero by
E zero divided by C.

367
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:57,076
And so this would also be fine.
E zero squared divided by mu

368
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:59,859
zero C.
And so now we have the time

369
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:04,278
average value of the pointing
vector.

370
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:09,616
The moment that you move to
vacuum -- from vacuum to -- to

371
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:14,392
matter, so we now go from
vacuum, we move to matter,

372
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:19,917
and the matter has dielectric
constant K and it has magnetic

373
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:24,319
permeability K of M.
That's only important if we

374
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,375
deal with ferromagnetism because
with paramagnetism and

375
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:34,807
diamagnetism K of M is always
practically for all practical

376
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:39,349
purposes one.
But kappa can vary a great

377
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:42,023
deal.
From the various substances.

378
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:46,237
And so now all you have to do,
if you go to Maxwell's

379
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:49,803
equations, if they were given
only in vacuum,

380
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:54,098
then you have to replace
epsilon zero by kappa epsilon

381
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:56,611
zero.
That's already done there.

382
00:25:56,611 --> 00:26:01,149
And you have to replace mu zero
by kappa M times mu zero.

383
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:06,093
And therefore you have to place
C by V because the velocity is

384
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:11,361
different in matter of
electromagnetic radiation.

385
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:17,438
And you see immediately how it
changes because epsilon zero and

386
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:23,516
mu zero have to be replaced by
epsilon zero K and mu zero kappa

387
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:29,496
of M and so you see here that
the velocity following my recipe

388
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:33,614
becomes epsilon zero mu zero
kappa kappa M.

389
00:26:33,614 --> 00:26:39,594
And so my B zero becomes now E
zero divided by V and no longer

390
00:26:39,594 --> 00:26:44,887
divided by C.
So this B zero becomes E zero

391
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:47,904
divided by V.
Kappa can be a very strong

392
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:50,766
function of frequency.
So can kappa M,

393
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:55,097
but kappa M of course is only
important for ferromagnetic

394
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:57,805
materials.
I've shown you an example

395
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:01,285
before that kappa,
the dielectric constant for

396
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:05,462
water, was eighty at low
frequencies, even at a hundred

397
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:07,628
megahertz.
Radio frequencies.

398
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:11,495
It was still eighty.
But at the visible light where

399
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:16,711
you're dealing with
frequencies of a few times ten

400
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:20,762
to the fourteen hertz,
that value for kappa was way

401
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:23,355
lower, was one point seven
seven.

402
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:27,65
And so kappa is a small
function, a strong function of

403
00:27:27,65 --> 00:27:30,973
um of frequency,
and we introduce index of

404
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:33,809
refraction, which is C divided
by V.

405
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:38,022
And since V itself is a strong
function of frequency,

406
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:42,641
the index of refraction can
also be a very strong function

407
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:47,585
of frequency.
Was one point three roughly for

408
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:50,737
water.
But it is a little different

409
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:54,167
from -- for red light from blue
light.

410
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:58,153
If not, we wouldn't be able to
see rainbows.

411
00:27:58,153 --> 00:28:01,12
OK.
Let's now talk about standing

412
00:28:01,12 --> 00:28:04,55
waves.
Let's start with strings again.

413
00:28:04,55 --> 00:28:10,206
This is a string with length L
and I generate in this string a

414
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:13,914
standing wave.
Standing waves can only be

415
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:20,403
generated at very discrete
frequencies for very special

416
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:24,117
wavelengths.
It's a resonance phenomenon.

417
00:28:24,117 --> 00:28:29,595
And the lowest frequency for
which this occurs will make the

418
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:32,566
string oscillate in this
fashion.

419
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:37,672
The string will do this.
This is called the fundamental.

420
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:42,778
Also the first harmonic.
Then there is a second harmonic

421
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:48,07
which is the next frequency up
for which it will resonate,

422
00:28:48,07 --> 00:28:54,012
which adds an extra node,
there is already a node here

423
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:57,546
and a node there,
and the system will then

424
00:28:57,546 --> 00:29:01,166
oscillate like so.
Fweet fweet fweet fweet.

425
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:04,527
And then so this is the second
harmonic.

426
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:09,44
And then I can go to the third
harmonic and I can continue

427
00:29:09,44 --> 00:29:13,75
forever, not quite,
but I can continue quite a bit,

428
00:29:13,75 --> 00:29:17,198
and this now would be the third
harmonic.

429
00:29:17,198 --> 00:29:23,317
And the frequencies that are
the resonant frequencies are

430
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:25,755
given by F of N,
N being Nancy,

431
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:29,41
that means either one or two or
three or four,

432
00:29:29,41 --> 00:29:33,96
one being the fundamental,
two being the second harmonic,

433
00:29:33,96 --> 00:29:38,996
this frequency is given N times
V divided by two L whereby V is

434
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:43,871
the speed of propagation of a
disturbance along the direction

435
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:47,039
of the string.
And L in this case is the

436
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,557
length.
And the asso- associated

437
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:53,944
wavelength lambda for that
particular harmonic is two L

438
00:29:53,944 --> 00:29:59,531
divided by N.
If you put in N equals one you

439
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:05,41
see that the wavelength is
indeed twice the length and if

440
00:30:05,41 --> 00:30:11,815
you put in N equals two you see
that the wavelength is exactly

441
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:14,964
L.
So let us write down for the

442
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:19,584
fundamental the equation for a
standing wave.

443
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:25,043
Y one, one refers to the
fundamental, would be Y zero

444
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:30,083
one, times the cosine of omega
one T

445
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:36,78
times the sine of K one X.
This is very different from a

446
00:30:36,78 --> 00:30:42,016
traveling wave.
All the time information now

447
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:47,618
here is decoupled from the
spatial information.

448
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:55,046
K one is again as before -- let
me write down a nicer K one --

449
00:30:55,046 --> 00:31:01,866
two pi divided by lambda.
And omega one is two pi times F

450
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:06,291
one.
What is so special here is that

451
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:09,224
there are points here,
values for X,

452
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:11,822
for which the sine becomes
zero.

453
00:31:11,822 --> 00:31:16,683
In the case of the fundamental
put in X equals zero and you

454
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:19,532
find that that sine is always
zero.

455
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:23,555
But if you put in X equals L,
you can check that,

456
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:27,075
it's also zero.
And if you go to the second

457
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:33,192
harmonic you will find that the
sine is zero there as well.

458
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:36,906
And so there are points now
which never move,

459
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:41,125
we call those nodes.
And that's very characteristic

460
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:44,838
for a standing wave.
I could go to the second

461
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:50,154
harmonic and all I would have to
do is put here a two and here a

462
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:52,939
two and here a two and here a
two.

463
00:31:52,939 --> 00:31:56,146
It would have its own little
amplitude.

464
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:59,606
Which would be this.
It would have its own

465
00:31:59,606 --> 00:32:03,066
frequency.
But that frequency omega two is

466
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:07,77
nonnegotiable.
That must be two omega one.

467
00:32:07,77 --> 00:32:11,871
And if I go to the third
harmonic, then omega three is

468
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:16,358
going to be three omega one.
But it has its own wavelength,

469
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:20,768
you'll get K of two would be
two pi divided by lambda two,

470
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:24,713
and the lambdas are -- the
lambdas are given by this

471
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:27,498
relationship.
I want you to get a few

472
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:32,063
minutes' rest now so that you
can digest this and then we'll

473
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:36,009
go to electromagnetic standing
waves.

474
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:38,252
And I want you to see this
again.

475
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:42,527
You've seen that before but I
want you to see it in a way that

476
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:46,453
you have not seen it yet.
We have here a -- a rubber hose

477
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:50,869
which we can oscillate and we're
going to oscillate it in such a

478
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:54,794
way, at least that's our goal,
to get the third harmonic,

479
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:58,158
and it's not so easy to get
exactly on resonance,

480
00:32:58,158 --> 00:33:01,663
but we will try that,
and Marcos decided to make it

481
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:06,359
very beautiful for you,
so he's going to put up a --

482
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,426
a black screen there because
once we are at resonance we're

483
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:14,913
going to strobe the s- string so
that you will in fact be able to

484
00:33:14,913 --> 00:33:17,998
follow the motion.
Your eyes can't see what's

485
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:21,363
going up and what's going down.
It goes too fast.

486
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:24,378
But when we strobe it we can
slow that down,

487
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,832
make the thing actually stand
still.

488
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:30,688
And that's our objective,
so you'll be able to see that.

489
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:33,983
And so let me turn on the
strobe, and this black

490
00:33:33,983 --> 00:33:37,349
background will help,
the strobe frequency is not

491
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:42,121
exactly the same
as the frequency of the -- of

492
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:46,598
the uh oscillating string,
so that allows you to actually

493
00:33:46,598 --> 00:33:50,596
see the slow motion.
And no one is arguing with me,

494
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:55,473
right, when the center portion
is down, the left and the right

495
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:57,871
portion are up,
and vice versa.

496
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:02,748
So you can really see now the
characteristics of this standing

497
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:05,307
wave.
Notice you see in this case

498
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:07,625
four nodes.
One at either end,

499
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,782
and you see two nodes in the
middle.

500
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:16,334
That is where the s- sine of
that curve is always zero.

501
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:20,802
I can add another strobe light
at a slightly different

502
00:34:20,802 --> 00:34:24,173
frequency.
I collaborated for a few years

503
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:27,208
with uh an artist,
his name was Tsai,

504
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:32,097
he worked at the Center for
Advanced Visual Studies here at

505
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:37,491
MIT, and he actually made art by
oscillating objects at resonance

506
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:43,054
frequency, rods and strings,
and he strobed them in a

507
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:49,437
way that I'm doing,
so I actually learned this from

508
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:53,266
him.
Quite pretty but also very

509
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:58,755
instructive.
You can really see what's going

510
00:34:58,755 --> 00:35:02,968
on.
In green you see the s- string

511
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:09,989
at a s- different moment in time
than you see it in red.

512
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:17,775
And as I said I purposely made
the frequencies of the strobe a

513
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:21,436
little
different.

514
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:26,255
Thanks, Marcos.
As you perhaps remember,

515
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:32,557
you can also generate a
standing wave in air itself.

516
00:35:32,557 --> 00:35:39,6
Wind instruments are nothing
but air columns which go into

517
00:35:39,6 --> 00:35:43,43
resonance.
If I have here a wind

518
00:35:43,43 --> 00:35:49,237
instrument which is open and
open on both sides,

519
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:55,416
this is the length of that
instrument,

520
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:59,605
then the frequencies that I can
generate are given by this

521
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:02,546
equation.
The only fundamental difference

522
00:36:02,546 --> 00:36:07,25
between the strings and the wind
instruments is that with strings

523
00:36:07,25 --> 00:36:11,807
you can change V at will more or
less, you can choose different

524
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:15,482
materials through which the
speed of propagation is

525
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:18,864
different, and you can also
change the tension.

526
00:36:18,864 --> 00:36:21,951
If you increase the tension
this V goes up.

527
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:25,626
So you can give a s- violin
four different strings,

528
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:30,207
they'll give you four different
fundamentals.

529
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:34,905
With a wind instrument you
cannot manipulate V because V is

530
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:38,712
the speed of sound.
And so that V of air at room

531
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:42,924
temperature is three hundred
forty meters per second.

532
00:36:42,924 --> 00:36:46,568
That's nonnegotiable.
And so you can with wind

533
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:51,428
instruments, you can very easily
predict the frequencies that

534
00:36:51,428 --> 00:36:55,316
you're going to hear.
I have here a pipe which is

535
00:36:55,316 --> 00:36:57,989
open and open,
open on both sides.

536
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:03,384
One-and-a-half meters long.
And if I apply that equation I

537
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:06,892
will find that the fundamental
would be at a hundred and

538
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,57
thirteen hertz.
Perhaps you remember that I

539
00:37:09,57 --> 00:37:13,268
told you that resonances can
occur when you sometimes least

540
00:37:13,268 --> 00:37:16,01
expect them.
Just by blowing air you can get

541
00:37:16,01 --> 00:37:18,561
resonances.
If you take a wind instrument

542
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:21,558
and you start to blow air it
excites resonances.

543
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:25,256
Remember the Tacoma Bridge.
There was wind and it went into

544
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:27,424
resonance.
It was very destructive.

545
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,931
Well here we have a system that
we can also make go into

546
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:34,438
resonance when you least expect
it.

547
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:37,101
We have a -- a copper grid
here.

548
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:39,763
And I'm going to heat that
grid.

549
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:45,172
And when I heat the grid -- get
an air flow going through there.

550
00:37:45,172 --> 00:37:49,724
That all by itself will not
make it go into resonance.

551
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:54,704
But when I take my heat source
away and that grid starts to

552
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:59,599
cool, it goes into resonance.
So I'm going to heat it now.

553
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,034
Will take a while.
If I heat it too long,

554
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:09,302
the copper grid will melt.
Many years ago when I was doing

555
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:17,97
this with a very short burner
the molten copper came down on

556
00:38:17,97 --> 00:38:23,994
my hands, which was not funny,
believe me.

557
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:32,221
If I don't do it long enough,
it won't go into resonance.

558
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:37,656
So I'm sort of guessing this a
little.

559
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:43,748
A hundred thirteen hertz.
All right.

560
00:38:43,748 --> 00:38:49,56
Standing electromagnetic waves.
When we go to standing

561
00:38:49,56 --> 00:38:55,919
electromagnetic waves let me
stay on the center board here.

562
00:38:55,919 --> 00:39:01,95
The situation is almost
identical to standing waves on a

563
00:39:01,95 --> 00:39:06,117
string.
Again we have -- we have nodes.

564
00:39:06,117 --> 00:39:12,916
We have locations where the
electric field is always

565
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:16,124
zero.
Very very different from a

566
00:39:16,124 --> 00:39:19,954
traveling wave.
I refer you to problem

567
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:26,06
nine-four where you will see a
standing electromagnetic wave

568
00:39:26,06 --> 00:39:31,235
which just like we had with the
-- with the string,

569
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:36,721
it has exactly this form.
The time domain is decoupled

570
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:42,31
from the spatial domain.
The only complication that you

571
00:39:42,31 --> 00:39:45,793
have
with a standing wave,

572
00:39:45,793 --> 00:39:49,405
electromagnetic,
is that it is not so easy to

573
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:52,196
find the associated magnetic
field.

574
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:56,875
And therefore I refer you to
that problem nine-four if you

575
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,666
want to revisit that.
Polarization.

576
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:02,703
Oh, we want to see the subjects
again.

577
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:07,464
See where we are on the list.
But I think the time has come

578
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:10,666
to talk a little bit about
polarization.

579
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,8
That's right.
Polarization.

580
00:40:12,8 --> 00:40:17,79
Let's take
electromagnetic waves that come

581
00:40:17,79 --> 00:40:21,002
straight out of the blackboard
to you.

582
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:26,472
And I call this the Y direction
and I call this the Z direc- the

583
00:40:26,472 --> 00:40:29,511
-- the X direction.
And Z is to you.

584
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:34,98
Notice X cross Y is Z always in
my case, right-handed coordinate

585
00:40:34,98 --> 00:40:37,759
system.
And so the electric field

586
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:43,055
vector of the plain wave that is
coming out of the blackboard,

587
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:49,192
let us assume that the electric
vector is oscillating like so.

588
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:52,685
Fweet fweet fweet fweet fweet
fweet fweet fweet.

589
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:56,997
With angular frequency omega.
If this is a straight line we

590
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,822
call that linearly polarized
radiation.

591
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:03,836
Could be radio emission as we
did with the seventy-five

592
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:07,627
megahertz transmitter.
It can also be visible light.

593
00:41:07,627 --> 00:41:11,939
As long as the E vector stays
along a straight line we call

594
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:15,581
that linearly polarized
electromagnetic radiation.

595
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:20,211
Electromagnetic
radiation including radio

596
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:25,698
waves, including visible light,
can be circularly polarized.

597
00:41:25,698 --> 00:41:30,813
In which case the electric
vector doesn't oscillate like

598
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:36,394
you see here but always has the
same strength and is rotating

599
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:40,951
around in a circle,
either in this direction or in

600
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:44,857
this direction.
And it's very easy to make,

601
00:41:44,857 --> 00:41:48,949
actually.
I could have done that

602
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:51,416
here in lectures but I never
did.

603
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:55,731
Suppose we have an antenna in
the Y direction and we have

604
00:41:55,731 --> 00:42:00,432
another one in the X direction
like our seventy-five megahertz

605
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:04,208
transmitter was a s- copper bar
in this direction.

606
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:08,832
And suppose each one radiates
with exactly the same value for

607
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:13,225
E zero, with exactly the same
frequency but they're ninety

608
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:16,847
degrees out of phase.
That's not so difficult to

609
00:42:16,847 --> 00:42:21,018
arrange.
Then I would get an EX which

610
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:25,044
would be E zero.
And if I pick my value for Z --

611
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:29,841
let's take Z equals zero,
who cares where you are in this

612
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:34,638
line, so there is no K Z term,
so we simply have a cosine

613
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:38,407
omega T here.
So this is the component of the

614
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:41,577
electric vector in the direction
of X.

615
00:42:41,577 --> 00:42:45,945
And let the one in the Y
direction -- must be ninety

616
00:42:45,945 --> 00:42:51,672
degrees out of phase,
but must have exactly the same

617
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:57,31
amplitude, so ninety degrees out
of phase would for instance be

618
00:42:57,31 --> 00:43:00,675
sine omega T.
Omegas must be the same.

619
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:04,04
To get circularly polarized
radiation.

620
00:43:04,04 --> 00:43:09,314
And so the net electric field
vector, the one that you will

621
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:14,498
experience sitting here on the Z
axis, will be EX in the X

622
00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:17,772
direction plus EY in the Y
direction.

623
00:43:17,772 --> 00:43:23,604
And so the magnitude
of this vector will be the

624
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:30,032
square root of EX squared plus
EY squared, and that is E zero.

625
00:43:30,032 --> 00:43:36,039
Because sine squared omega T
plus cosine square omega T is

626
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:39,727
one.
And so you get under the square

627
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:45,102
root E zero squared times one,
and so that's E zero.

628
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:51,53
And so you see that the
amplitude is always E zero.

629
00:43:51,53 --> 00:43:56,101
You see that here in front of
you and so it's going to rotate

630
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:59,986
around when it's maximum in Y,
then it is zero in X,

631
00:43:59,986 --> 00:44:03,262
and when it is maximum in X it
is zero in Y,

632
00:44:03,262 --> 00:44:07,604
and so therefore you get this
rotation, either this way or

633
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:10,423
that way.
Depending upon how the phase

634
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:13,775
delay is arranged.
And you can turn this into

635
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:18,498
elliptical polarized radiation
by simply for instance putting a

636
00:44:18,498 --> 00:44:21,392
two here.
If you put a two there or let

637
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:25,277
me a put a two in the X
direction,

638
00:44:25,277 --> 00:44:30,567
because I have more room in the
X direction on the blackboard,

639
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:35,596
so if I put a two here that
means that in the X direction I

640
00:44:35,596 --> 00:44:40,799
can go twice as far as I can go
in the Y direction and so now

641
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:45,915
the E vector will go like this.
You see this now is twice as

642
00:44:45,915 --> 00:44:50,424
much as this and so now I have
elliptically polarized

643
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:53,112
radiation.
OK, so far is for the

644
00:44:53,112 --> 00:44:57,447
polarization is concerned.
Let's talk

645
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:02,407
about Snell's law.
Snell's law was discovered two

646
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:05,92
hundred fifty years before
Maxwell.

647
00:45:05,92 --> 00:45:11,19
It's quite an amazing
accomplishment even though you

648
00:45:11,19 --> 00:45:16,15
can derive it from Maxwell's
equations of course.

649
00:45:16,15 --> 00:45:22,143
But it was derived by this
Dutchman two hundred fifty years

650
00:45:22,143 --> 00:45:27,206
earlier.
And what Maxwell's e- what uh

651
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:32,376
Snell's law tells us is that if
we have light going from a

652
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:37,457
medium one with index of
refraction N one going to medium

653
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:43,081
two with index of refraction N
two, and this angle of incidence

654
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:46,528
is theta one,
this is the normal to the

655
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:51,427
surface, and we get some
reflection, this angle is also

656
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:56,689
theta one, and then some of that
light will enter into this

657
00:45:56,689 --> 00:46:00,952
medium and this angle will then
be

658
00:46:00,952 --> 00:46:04,481
theta two.
And Snell's law says that the

659
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:09,728
sine of theta one divided by the
sine of theta two is N one

660
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:13,98
divided by N two.
Always the medium where you're

661
00:46:13,98 --> 00:46:19,589
going is up, the medium where --
oh, it's the other way around.

662
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:24,927
Ha, good that I caught that,
this is N two divided by N one,

663
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:30,446
so the medium that you're going
is up and the medium where you

664
00:46:30,446 --> 00:46:33,112
came
from is down.

665
00:46:33,112 --> 00:46:38,41
And so it's immediately obvious
that if N two is larger than N

666
00:46:38,41 --> 00:46:43,534
one that the angle of theta two
is always smaller than theta

667
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,399
one.
Let us assume now that you go

668
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:51,349
from air to glass but that
somehow you come out in the air

669
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:54,128
again.
So right here this is your

670
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:57,168
angle of incidence now,
I call it I,

671
00:46:57,168 --> 00:47:02,378
it's clear that I is theta two.
And here you're coming out of

672
00:47:02,378 --> 00:47:05,601
the
medium in air again,

673
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:09,688
and I call this angle R,
and I'm going to ask you the

674
00:47:09,688 --> 00:47:14,405
question what is that angle R,
now some of you may have great

675
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:18,885
insight and immediately say oh
well it's obvious that it's

676
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:21,479
going to be the same as theta
one.

677
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:26,038
And that is indeed correct.
You can easily see that because

678
00:47:26,038 --> 00:47:30,833
the sine of theta one divided by
the sine of theta two at this

679
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:35,786
transition at point A -- so this
is at point A --

680
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:41,888
would be N of glass divided by
N of air, and now we come here

681
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:46,464
at this point B,
so at point B we get the sine

682
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:52,159
of this angle of incidence I,
which we know is theta two,

683
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,838
that's obvious,
divided by the sine of R is now

684
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:02,838
the one where we're going to
which is air divided by the one

685
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:07,211
where we were,
so this is N air divided by N

686
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:11,277
glass.
And we already agreed that I is

687
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:13,891
theta two.
And so when I multiply these

688
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,988
two equations,
on the right side I get exactly

689
00:48:16,988 --> 00:48:19,396
one.
Independent of the color of the

690
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,804
light.
If blue light has a different

691
00:48:21,804 --> 00:48:25,589
index of refraction than red
light, that doesn't matter,

692
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:29,029
because I have the same one
here that I have there.

693
00:48:29,029 --> 00:48:32,057
And so you get exactly one on
the right side,

694
00:48:32,057 --> 00:48:35,085
so you must get exactly one on
the left side,

695
00:48:35,085 --> 00:48:39,833
and so the consequence is that
theta one must be R,

696
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,71
and so this angle here is the
same as that angle,

697
00:48:42,71 --> 00:48:44,748
which is perhaps not so
surprising.

698
00:48:44,748 --> 00:48:47,806
Because these two planes are
parallel to each other.

699
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:51,103
If they were not parallel,
as they were with one of your

700
00:48:51,103 --> 00:48:54,759
problems where we had a prism,
then you would get a separation

701
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:57,637
of the colors here,
and then the red and the blue

702
00:48:57,637 --> 00:48:59,915
would come out in different
directions.

703
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:03,572
In this case red and blue and
green and yellow all come out in

704
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:07,049
the same direction and so you
see white light when you look

705
00:49:07,049 --> 00:49:09,985
through plain parallel
glass.

706
00:49:09,985 --> 00:49:13,81
When it comes to total
reflection, I refer you to

707
00:49:13,81 --> 00:49:17,317
problem nine-eight if you can
spare the time.

708
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:20,027
You're going to have five
problems.

709
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:24,888
Two of them have one question.
Two of them have two questions.

710
00:49:24,888 --> 00:49:27,837
And one has four true-false
questions.

711
00:49:27,837 --> 00:49:31,264
For each correct answer you get
four points.

712
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:35,408
For each wrong answer I have to
subtract four points.

713
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:38,038
However, you don't have to
answer.

714
00:49:38,038 --> 00:49:42,262
If you don't answer you don't
gain,

715
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:45,369
you don't lose points.
Now before you hate me for

716
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:48,863
subtracting four points,
think about this for a minute.

717
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:51,775
If you give true-false
questions to a class of

718
00:49:51,775 --> 00:49:55,723
five-year-olds they will have
half on average correct and half

719
00:49:55,723 --> 00:49:57,535
wrong.
Yet they deserve zero.

720
00:49:57,535 --> 00:50:01,547
So clearly the only reasonable
thing is that for a wrong answer

721
00:50:01,547 --> 00:50:05,041
you must subtract points.
But you don't have to answer.

722
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:08,924
So if you know to two for sure
out of four you could consider

723
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:12,03
not to answer the other two.
That is your choice.

724
00:50:12,03 --> 00:50:16,591
I'll give you an example.
The Benham top consists of

725
00:50:16,591 --> 00:50:19,624
several colors.
When you rotate it fast you see

726
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:21,272
white light.
That's wrong.

727
00:50:21,272 --> 00:50:24,107
That's false.
Because the Benham top did not

728
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:28,128
have several colors and when we
rotated it we didn't see white

729
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:30,501
light.
I'll give you another example.

730
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:34,325
One of two tails of comets is
due to radiation pressure and

731
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:36,566
the other is due to the solar
wind.

732
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,532
That's correct.
We discussed that in lectures.

733
00:50:39,532 --> 00:50:41,906
Let me end with some fatherly
advice.

734
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:45,333
Read each problem at least
twice

735
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,632
and do those problems first
that you like the best.

736
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:52,195
Those that suit you the best.
Never spend more than ten

737
00:50:52,195 --> 00:50:55,098
minutes on one problem.
Then move to another.

738
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:58,727
There is another review
tomorrow evening for three hours

739
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:01,498
by Ali Nayeri.
You may want to attend that.

740
00:51:01,498 --> 00:51:05,06
And we also will provide you
with tutoring this Sunday.

741
00:51:05,06 --> 00:51:07,963
Look at the Web.
Because we will update it as

742
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:09,942
the time comes.
See you Monday.

743
00:51:09,942 --> 51:15
Have a good weekend.
