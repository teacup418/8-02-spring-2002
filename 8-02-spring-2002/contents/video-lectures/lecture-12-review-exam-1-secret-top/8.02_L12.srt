1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03,138



2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:08,508
You see here the topics the way
I see them, you will get three

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:13,086
problems to -- on the exam,
and not all subjects can,

4
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:16,344
of course, be represented on
the exam.

5
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:20,218
Nor can I cover all of them in
fifty minutes.

6
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:25,324
I will test some very basic
ideas, the math will be utterly

7
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:30,343
trivial, and if it becomes
complicated, then you just know

8
00:00:30,343 --> 00:00:35,802
that you're on the wrong track.
If you get stuck,

9
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:39,249
somehow, on a problem,
my advice is,

10
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:44,764
move on, don't stay with the
problem, but move on and try

11
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:49,294
some others first.
There is a reason why Gauss'

12
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:53,431
Law there is in red,
because Gauss' Law is,

13
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:59,537
of course, extremely important
in the early part of the course,

14
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:05,151
the closed surface integral of
E dot D A is the sum of the

15
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:10,113
enclosed charged,
divided by epsilon zero.

16
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:15,133
And that is so important that
you can be sure that there will

17
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:18,313
be one problem dealing with
Gauss' Law.

18
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:23,333
Now, when you have Gauss' Law
problems, there's always one of

19
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,759
three.
You must have symmetry,

20
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,691
you must have a special
distribution of charges,

21
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:33,373
because otherwise,
Gauss' Law doesn't get you

22
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,636
anywhere.
So we have spherical symmetry,

23
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:40,087
we
have cylindrical symmetry,

24
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:43,902
and we have plain symmetry,
and that's all there is.

25
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:46,969
So you're going to get one of
those three.

26
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:49,438
I will do one now,
you may choose.

27
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,029
We're going to have a vote.
One is a possibility,

28
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:57,667
I do one on spherical symmetry,
another one I do on cylindrical

29
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,585
symmetry, or I do one on  slab
symmetry.

30
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:02,979
Who wants the spherical
symmetry?

31
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:05,298
Hands.
Who wants the cylindrical

32
00:02:05,298 --> 00:02:07,094
symmetry?
Way more hands.

33
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:11,209
Who wants plain?
I think the

34
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,55
cylinders have it.
But if you're clever,

35
00:02:14,55 --> 00:02:19,435
you can stay for the next
lecture, and then you can try to

36
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:23,291
get the other one.
We need a little bit of fun

37
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,004
today.
And therefore,

38
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:29,717
I want to introduce you first
to something very special,

39
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:33,659
which is close to my heart,
it is a secret top,

40
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,858
you're going to see it there,
and that secret top,

41
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:41,714
I'm going to spin,
and if you're a believer in

42
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:46,306
eight oh one,
which you should by now,

43
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:51,527
then we will -- should be able
to predict that that stop cannot

44
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:55,653
spin for very long,
there is friction with the air

45
00:02:55,653 --> 00:03:00,79
and friction with the surface,
and so chances are it will soon

46
00:03:00,79 --> 00:03:04,159
fall over.
We'll take a look at it later,

47
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,022
again.
So let's now start our first

48
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:10,643
problem, and that is a
cylindrical symmetry.

49
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:16,454
Well, we have a cylinder -- and
here is the cylinder --

50
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:19,536
it's very long,
has radius R,

51
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:25,261
and I have uniform charge
distribution throughout the

52
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:30,325
whole cylinder,
and the density is rho Coulombs

53
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:35,279
per cubic meter.
Uniformly distributed through

54
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:39,242
the cylinder.
I want to know what the

55
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:44,967
electric field inside the
cylinder is and outside the

56
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:48,82
cylinder.
Let's first do outside the

57
00:03:48,82 --> 00:03:53,272
cylinder.
The gauss surface,

58
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:59,503
clearly, is going to be itself
a cylinder, there it goes -- you

59
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:05,333
can give it any random length,
L, cannot have any effect on

60
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:11,564
the answer -- and so the end if
flat, perpendicular to the axis

61
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:17,595
of symmetry, and this front part
is flat, and this is curved.

62
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:23,684
I give this a radius little R,
and so I know that everywhere

63
00:04:23,684 --> 00:04:28,176
on the surface of that cylinder
outside, that the electric field

64
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:32,027
must be the same everywhere
because the distance is the

65
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:34,452
same, that's the symmetry
argument.

66
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:38,66
Electric field cannot be any
stronger here than it is there,

67
00:04:38,66 --> 00:04:42,368
if I'm on that surface.
Symmetry argument number one.

68
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:46,576
Symmetry argument number two
is, given the fact that this is

69
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:50,997
a cylinder, the electric field
must everywhere be perpendicular

70
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,562
to this
axis, coming out -- I call it

71
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:57,482
radially, but,
of course, it is not radially,

72
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:01,264
like a sphere -- it's radially
coming out of this surface,

73
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:04,25
always perpendicular to this
axis of symmetry.

74
00:05:04,25 --> 00:05:06,705
Nature could not decide any
other way.

75
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:09,028
That's the second symmetry
argument.

76
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:12,279
One you recognize that
argument, the electric flux

77
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,195
through this flat surface and
through that flat surface must

78
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:17,588
be zero.
Because then,

79
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:20,442
the electric field and the
local D A vector,

80
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:23,959
which is the perpendicular to
the

81
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,579
surface, make angles of ninety
degrees with each other,

82
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:30,999
because E would be like this
here, but D A is in the

83
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,212
direction of the axis of
symmetry.

84
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:36,296
So no flux can,
therefore, get out here and get

85
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:38,777
out here.
But only through this curved

86
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:41,124
surface.
But on this curved surface,

87
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,879
if it is a positive charge,
then the E vector and the D A

88
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,433
are in the same direction,
if it is a negative charge,

89
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,512
they are in opposite
directions.

90
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:53,999
Later, you can change the sign
of

91
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:56,738
rho, let's just make it
positive for now.

92
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:00,848
So if, now, I apply Gauss' Law,
then I only have to take this

93
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:04,204
surface into account and not
these two end pieces.

94
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:07,491
And so I need to know,
now, what this surface is,

95
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:11,669
because E and D A are always in
the same direction everywhere,

96
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,299
thus the cosine of the angle
between them is plus one.

97
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,423
And so what is the surface
area?

98
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:21,258
That is going to be L times two
pi little R, and then the

99
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:25,854
electric vector is
everywhere, the same there,

100
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:30,494
this was our symmetry argument,
and that is now the charge

101
00:06:30,494 --> 00:06:34,158
inside this cylinder,
divided by epsilon zero.

102
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:37,903
But, of course,
the charge inside the cylinder,

103
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:42,3
that's only the portion that is
in this inner cylinder,

104
00:06:42,3 --> 00:06:45,23
and so that has also,
then, length L.

105
00:06:45,23 --> 00:06:50,115
The cross-section here is pi r
squared, so this is the volume

106
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:55,245
of the volume of the charge that
I have inside by

107
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:58,803
Gaussian surface,
I must multiply by rho,

108
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:03,606
that gives in the charge,
and I divide by epsilon zero.

109
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:06,097
And of course,
the L cancels,

110
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:09,833
as it always does,
and the pi cancels here,

111
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,992
too, and so I find that the
electric field equals r squared

112
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:20,508
times rho divided by two epsilon
zero r, and if you want to see

113
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:24,333
it vectorially,
you can put an r roof there,

114
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,425
r roof, then,
would be a vector

115
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:33,742
which is perpendicular to the
axis -- I mentioned earlier,

116
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:36,633
I called that radially
outwards.

117
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:41,297
So this is the electric field
outside the cylinder.

118
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:44,282
R squared rho two epsilon zero
r.

119
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:49,786
So it falls off as one over r.
So now I want to know what it

120
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:53,517
is inside the cylinder.
So now I go to r,

121
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:58,088
less than equal to r.
So it's clear that what I do

122
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:02,291
now,
I'm going to have a Gaussian

123
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,328
surface which,
again, is a cylinder,

124
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:08,018
has length L,
and it has, again,

125
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:12,618
two flat pieces at the end,
so no flux will go through

126
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:16,697
those two pieces,
so my first term of Gauss' Law

127
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:21,47
is going to be the same,
I have L times two pi little R,

128
00:08:21,47 --> 00:08:25,723
because the radius of this
inner circle is also r,

129
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:30,322
L two pi r times the electric
field, the arguments are

130
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:35,401
identical -- but
now, there is less charge

131
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:39,727
inside by Gaussian surface.
Uh, the volume is L,

132
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:45,158
now times pi little R squared,
and then I get rho to convert

133
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,563
it to charge,
divided by epsilon zero.

134
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:51,049
I lose my L,
as I always do,

135
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:56,48
my pi goes, and so now I get E
equals -- there is an r here,

136
00:08:56,48 --> 00:09:02,187
and there is an R squared here,
an so I only end up with one R,

137
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:08,201
divide by two epsilon zero,
and if you like that vector

138
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:10,857
notation, you can always do
this.

139
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:13,763
And of course,
if rho were negative,

140
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:17,83
then automatically,
you see, if you put a negative

141
00:09:17,83 --> 00:09:22,062
charge density in here,
then the E field flips over,

142
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,628
so that's automatically taken
into account both here and

143
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:29,366
there.
So let's take a look at it,

144
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:33,682
I'm quite happy with that.
If you substitute little R

145
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:38,566
equals
capital R, you are right at the

146
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:44,089
surface of your cylinder,
then you get the same answer in

147
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:46,456
both cases.
Substitute R,

148
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:50,796
capital R in here,
then the magnitude of E --

149
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:56,911
don't worry about the direction
now -- is rho capital R divided

150
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:01,941
by two epsilon zero,
and if you put in here for this

151
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:06,38
little R, capital R,
you find exactly the same

152
00:10:06,38 --> 00:10:09,832
answer.
So we can now make a plot of

153
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:15,159
the
electric field as a function of

154
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:21,845
distance R, here being capital
R, and here being the electric

155
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:25,633
field strength.
It's a linear line,

156
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:30,312
zero here, it goes up to a
certain maximum,

157
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:34,212
and then it falls off as one
over R.

158
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:37,889
And this value here is this
value.

159
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:43,125
That's where little R is
capital R.

160
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,444
It is obvious and pleasing that
the electric field,

161
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:49,231
on the axis itself,
where little r is zero,

162
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:53,147
that that electric field is
zero, that is something that you

163
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:56,399
could have predicted almost
without any knowledge,

164
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,248
because you have symmetry all
around it, there is charge on

165
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:03,5
the left, there is charge on the
-- one the right,

166
00:11:03,5 --> 00:11:07,283
there's charge on north and
south, and the electric fields

167
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:10,602
right at the center,
of course, all pair each other

168
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,588
[unintelligible],
so you get no electric field

169
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:17,37
right at the center.
If the charge,

170
00:11:17,37 --> 00:11:20,865
for some reason,
would all be at the outer

171
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:25,468
surface, if it were a solid
conductor that would be the

172
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:30,668
case, then the electric field
would be zero everywhere inside,

173
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:34,249
and this would be unchanged,
assuming then,

174
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:39,108
that you have the same amount
of charge on the outside per

175
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:42,603
unit length as you now have on
the inside.

176
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:45,246
So that is cylindrical
symmetry.

177
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:49,678
I am dying to take a look at my
top.

178
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:55,283
I am really  -- and much to my
shock, do I see that it stopped?

179
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:59,802
It's still rotating.
So maybe I have to come to the

180
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:04,593
conclusion that there is
something wrong with eight oh

181
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:07,485
one.
There must be a layer deeper

182
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:11,733
than eight oh one -- there is
friction, and yet,

183
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,535
this top doesn't come to a
halt.

184
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:19,868
And so that layer deeper --
maybe that layer deeper is eight

185
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:24,798
oh two.
Give that some thought,

186
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:28,311
it may add to your sleepless
nights.

187
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:33,53
We'll visit it later,
because maybe it will come to a

188
00:12:33,53 --> 00:12:35,035
stop.
Very well.

189
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:38,749
Let's now do something very
different.

190
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:43,968
I have two conducting flat
plates for the plane plate

191
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:49,89
capacitor, and it has a certain
thickness, the material is a

192
00:12:49,89 --> 00:12:55,812
conducting material,
has a certain thickness,

193
00:12:55,812 --> 00:13:00,762
it's very large in size.
Way bigger is the plane

194
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:06,555
linearly than the separation.
And let this separation be

195
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:13,191
little d, and I charge the upper
plate with a positive charge so

196
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:17,826
I get here surface charge
density plus sigma,

197
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:22,776
and here minus sigma,
area is A, of both plates.

198
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:29,938
I know that in the conductor
itself, there is no current,

199
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:33,153
and therefore,
in the conductor itself,

200
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:35,775
the electric field must be
zero.

201
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:39,751
I have an electric field
between the two plates,

202
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:44,572
which can be derived using
Gauss' Law, but we have already

203
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:49,309
used up our time on Gauss' Law,
which is sigma divided by

204
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:52,947
epsilon zero.
And the electric outside these

205
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:58,022
two plates is very close to zero
here, and also very close to

206
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:01,538
zero here.
We find that from the

207
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:04,54
superposition principle --
because this plate,

208
00:14:04,54 --> 00:14:08,41
which is negatively charged,
will add to the electric field

209
00:14:08,41 --> 00:14:11,213
pointing down,
and as you perhaps remember,

210
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,615
that that is independent of
distance.

211
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:17,818
Well, provided that you are not
so far away from the plates that

212
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:21,088
the dimension of the plates is
going to interfere.

213
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:24,958
The -- if the plate is ten by
ten meters, then it's fine as

214
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,693
long as you are,
say, within a few meters.

215
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:31,296
But it you go a hundred meters
away, then it's not true

216
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:35,164
anymore.
So if we assume that we don't

217
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:38,267
go too far out,
then the electric field due to

218
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:41,991
this one pointing down,
due to this one is pointing up,

219
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:45,576
and they have equal strength,
they are independent of

220
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:49,783
distance, so they cancel each
other here, and they cancel each

221
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:52,196
other there, superposition
argument.

222
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:56,402
Let this point be P inside the
conductor, and this point be S,

223
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:59,781
and the first thing I would ask
you, for instance,

224
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:03,504
is what is V P minus V S?
It's the potential difference

225
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:06,411
over
this capacitor,

226
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:09,56
if you want to call it a
capacitor.

227
00:15:09,56 --> 00:15:13,451
That is the integral,
in going from P to S,

228
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:17,341
of E dot D L.
For reasons that I have never

229
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:21,602
understood, your book will
switch these around,

230
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:25,863
and put here a minus sign,
which is, of course,

231
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:30,587
exactly the same thing.
And so now, we can calculate

232
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:34,107
the potential difference.
If I am here,

233
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:39,863
and I'm going to walk down --
suppose I walk down

234
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:44,374
[unintelligible] a straight
line, do D L is in the same

235
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:48,05
direction as E,
then it's immediately obvious

236
00:15:48,05 --> 00:15:53,147
that this is simply E times that
distance D, because E and D L

237
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:57,491
are in the same direction.
So the cosine of the angle

238
00:15:57,491 --> 00:16:02,002
between them is plus one.
And so I find that this is E,

239
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,595
which is, um,
sigma divided by epsilon zero,

240
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:11,435
times that distance D.
If I had chosen another route,

241
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:16,724
I would have found the same
answer, because we're dealing

242
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:22,201
here with conservative fields,
so the path does not matter.

243
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:26,922
So as long as you go from this
plate to this plate,

244
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:30,038
that integral is always E times
D.

245
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:34,854
What is the potential
difference between point P and

246
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:37,404
point T here?
V P minus V T,

247
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:43,468
it's clear that that is zero,
because there is no electric

248
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:47,547
field here, and there is no
electric field anywhere there,

249
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,052
so the integral,
obviously, is zero.

250
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,7
What is the capacitance of this
plate?

251
00:16:52,7 --> 00:16:55,705
The capacitance is the charge
on one plate,

252
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:59,713
divided by the potential
difference, which I just use the

253
00:16:59,713 --> 00:17:03,362
word V now, it means it is this
value V P minus V S.

254
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:06,368
So what is the charge on one of
the plates?

255
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:10,59
It doesn't matter which one you
take, that is sigma times A.

256
00:17:10,59 --> 00:17:14,581
That's the definition of sigma,
right?

257
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:18,86
It's charge per unit area.
So that's the charge on the

258
00:17:18,86 --> 00:17:23,219
plate, and the potential
difference we just calculated,

259
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:26,368
that is sigma D divided by
epsilon zero,

260
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:30,404
so the epsilon zero comes
upstairs, and so we find,

261
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:34,441
now, that it is A times epsilon
zero, divided by D.

262
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:37,912
Notice it's independent of
sigma, of course.

263
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:42,191
Capacitance is geometry,
it has nothing to do with how

264
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:46,55
much charge you have on the
capacitor.

265
00:17:46,55 --> 00:17:50,889
I could ask you what is the
electrostatic potential energy.

266
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:54,928
The electrostatic potential
energy is the work that you

267
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:59,49
would have to do to assemble the
positive charges here and the

268
00:17:59,49 --> 00:18:03,305
negative charges there.
You could also look at it at

269
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:07,344
the energy that it takes to
create that electric field.

270
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:10,411
Same question.
So this work that has to be

271
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:14,525
done to assemble it is the
charge on one plate times the

272
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:20,516
potential difference times
one-half, or -- which is the

273
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:26,157
same -- one-half C V squared.
So, what is one-half Q V?

274
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:30,753
Let's first take this one,
there is one-half,

275
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:35,14
Q is sigma times A,
potential difference V,

276
00:18:35,14 --> 00:18:39,632
we have, is here,
sigma D divided by epsilon

277
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:44,333
zero, so this is the answer that
we will find.

278
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:48,615
From this one,
and the answer that we find

279
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:52,294
from the
other one must,

280
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:55,973
of course, by the same.
Let's check that.

281
00:18:55,973 --> 00:19:01,309
This is C, [unintelligible] is
A epsilon zero divided by D,

282
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:06,738
and now I must multiply by the
potential difference squared,

283
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:10,693
so I get a sigma squared,
I get a D squared,

284
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:15,938
and I get an epsilon zero
squared, and these two better be

285
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:18,973
the same.
I have sigma sigma here,

286
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:23,958
sigma squared,
I have D squared divided by D,

287
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:27,65
so I have only one D,
I have an epsilon z- zero

288
00:19:27,65 --> 00:19:30,38
squared here and here,
and epsilon,

289
00:19:30,38 --> 00:19:34,313
so I have only one over epsilon
zero, so they are,

290
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:37,925
indeed, the same.
Now I could ask you where is

291
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:41,457
the charge located?
Let's first go to the top

292
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:45,712
plate, where is the charge
located on the upper plate?

293
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:49,725
Some of you may say,
"Oh, well, maybe the charge is

294
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:53,337
in the plate,
somewhere here.

295
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:56,289
That cannot be.
I make a Gaussian surface all

296
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:59,174
around that charge.
Gauss' Law will tell me,

297
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:02,595
then, that the surface,
closed surface integral of E

298
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:06,017
dot D A is not zero,
because there is charge inside,

299
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:10,109
and if there is charge inside,
that closed surface integral is

300
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,067
not zero -- but we know that the
electric field must be zero

301
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:17,757
everywhere, zero in the
conductor, everywhere it must be

302
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:21,044
zero, so the closed surface
integral must be zero.

303
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:23,392
So there cannot be any charge
there.

304
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:27,832
Simple argument.
Some of you may say,

305
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:32,188
"OK, maybe some of the charge
here is at the top surface.

306
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:35,378
Not allowed either,
in this configuration.

307
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:39,734
I make myself a small pillbox,
which is my Gauss surface,

308
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:43,467
these are flat ends.
Electric field is zero here,

309
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:46,89
electric field is zero there,
sot he surface,

310
00:20:46,89 --> 00:20:51,713
closed surface integral must be
zero because the electric field

311
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:55,524
is zero everywhere,
but there is charge inside the

312
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:59,803
pillbox, and so Gauss' Law says
that it

313
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:02,4
cannot be zero.
Since it is zero,

314
00:21:02,4 --> 00:21:06,296
there's no charge inside.
And so there's only one

315
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:11,004
solution, nature puts all the
positive charge right here at

316
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:15,388
the bottom of this plate,
and the negative charge right

317
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:20,096
there at the top of that plate.
That's the only solution in

318
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:23,424
this case.
Charge cannot be anywhere else.

319
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:27,239
I can't believe it.
That thing is still running.

320
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:31,217
I want you to take a look at
that.

321
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:35,193
You see that top is still
happily running,

322
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:40,818
so either this has to be a
violation of the conservation of

323
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:45,182
energy somehow,
or it is black magic -- it can

324
00:21:45,182 --> 00:21:49,934
never be excluded in twenty six
one hundred -- or,

325
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:54,492
perhaps, there is some simple
physics behind it.

326
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:59,827
And whatever that simple
physics is, I would like you to

327
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:02,833
start thinking about.
All right.

328
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:08,318
Next subject.
Again, let me come with a --

329
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:12,967
with two plates,
because I want to start talking

330
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:17,418
about dielectrics,
and I want to  massage this

331
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:20,979
idea of capacitance a little
further.

332
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:24,737
I have here a parallel plate
capacitor.

333
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:28,1
And I put on here,
positive charge,

334
00:22:28,1 --> 00:22:32,947
plus sigma, I call it now,
sigma free, there is no

335
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:38,916
dielectric yet,
but, later, there will be,

336
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:43,825
so I call it sigma free,
and here is minus sigma free,

337
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:46,975
separation is D,
surface area is A.

338
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:51,05
So in the beginning,
it's going to be boring,

339
00:22:51,05 --> 00:22:56,886
we know that the electric field
here is going in this direction,

340
00:22:56,886 --> 00:23:01,98
and that electric field is
sigma free divided by epsilon

341
00:23:01,98 --> 00:23:05,13
zero.
The free goes with the sigma.

342
00:23:05,13 --> 00:23:11,052
I  charge it up using a
power supply,

343
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:19,434
and now -- this is crucial -- I
disconnect the power supply.

344
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:25,97
I take the leads off.
So I disconnect the power

345
00:23:25,97 --> 00:23:30,516
supply.
That means -- and this is

346
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:40,035
crucial -- that whatever comes
that this charge is trapped,

347
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:44,029
can never change.
No matter what we're going to

348
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:46,114
do.
Power supply has been

349
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:49,588
disconnected,
that sigma free is trapped.

350
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:52,54
I'm going to do various things
now.

351
00:23:52,54 --> 00:23:56,97
I'm going to change the
distance between the plates,

352
00:23:56,97 --> 00:24:00,965
and then independently,
I'm going to shove in a

353
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:05,567
dielectric, we will do that
separately, one at a time.

354
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:10,778
And so the equations that I can
now trust, and that I will be

355
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:16,25
looking at, are the following.
The -- the free

356
00:24:16,25 --> 00:24:21,342
charge that I have,
Q free, is obviously sigma free

357
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:25,823
times the area.
And that is the definition of

358
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:30,61
surface charge density.
So I can trust that one.

359
00:24:30,61 --> 00:24:36,823
The electric field between the
plates is sigma free divided by

360
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:40,999
epsilon zero,
and now I get a kappa there,

361
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:45,887
if we have a dielectric.
The potential difference

362
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:52,065
between the plates is E D.
Provided I know the E,

363
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:55,074
this is the E,
it's always E D.

364
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:59,084
We just had that in our
previous problem.

365
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:04,198
The capacitance itself,
C, is the free charge on one

366
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:10,215
plate divided by the potential
difference between the plates,

367
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:14,627
V is my potential difference,
that is this V,

368
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:21,244
and the electrostatic potential
energy equals one-half

369
00:25:21,244 --> 00:25:25,722
Q free times V,
but it is also one-half C V

370
00:25:25,722 --> 00:25:29,56
squared.
And so keep these in mind in

371
00:25:29,56 --> 00:25:33,079
what follows.
Take a look at them,

372
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:38,089
the first one is correct,
second one is correct,

373
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:42,461
third one is correct,
that one is correct,

374
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:48,218
that one I can also live with.
Or you could write down,

375
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:53,229
for the capacitance,
if you wanted

376
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:58,402
that, you can write down A
times epsilon zero divided by D,

377
00:25:58,402 --> 00:26:02,237
times kappa.
The first thing I'm going to do

378
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:05,269
with the power supply
disconnected,

379
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:10,175
I'm going to increase the
distance D between the plates.

380
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:15,437
And I'm going to increase them
by a distance -- I'm going to

381
00:26:15,437 --> 00:26:19,629
double the distance.
So D goes up by a factor of

382
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:23,196
two.
But kappa remains one.

383
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:25,861
Just air.
No dielectric yet.

384
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:29,512
What happened with the electric
field?

385
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:31,387
E.
E can not change,

386
00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:36,913
because sigma free cannot
change, kappa is one -- there's

387
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:42,538
no kappa -- and if this cannot
change, this cannot change.

388
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:48,065
So, as I move the plates apart,
there is no change in the

389
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:53,69
electric field.
Non-intuitive as that may be

390
00:26:53,69 --> 00:26:56,974
for you, the electric field
remains a constant.

391
00:26:56,974 --> 00:27:01,258
So what happens now with the
potential difference between the

392
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:03,828
plates?
That, now, must increase by a

393
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:06,827
factor of two,
because if I increase D by a

394
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:09,683
factor of two,
and if E is doing nothing,

395
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:12,253
then V must go up by a factor
of two.

396
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:14,681
So V must go up by a factor of
two.

397
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:18,751
And I did a demonstration here,
during one of my lectures,

398
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:22,892
whereby I changed D from one
millimeter to ten millimeters,

399
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:28,445
and I changed the potential
difference from thousand volts

400
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:32,454
to ten thousand volts,
you've seen it in front of your

401
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:36,689
own eyes, if you were here.
So, indeed, when you separate

402
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:40,092
the plates with the power supply
disconnected,

403
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,512
the potential difference goes
up.

404
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:45,008
What happens with the
capacitance?

405
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:48,336
Well, the capacitance is Q free
divided by V.

406
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:52,117
There's an R missing here.
This one doesn't change.

407
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:56,504
This one goes up by a factor of
two, so C must go down by a

408
00:27:56,504 --> 00:28:00,587
factor of two.
What happens with the

409
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:06,074
electrostatic potential energy?
Well, it is one-half Q free

410
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:11,655
times V, Q free cannot change,
V went up by a factor of two,

411
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:14,871
so U must go up by a factor of
two.

412
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:20,546
Remember that when I separated
these plates and increased the

413
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:25,181
potential difference,
I told you I was doing work.

414
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:29,249
U is increasing.
If I move the plates apart,

415
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,694
I have to do that work.
All right.

416
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:39,552
So this is the first part,
whereby we change D.

417
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:44,518
Now, I go back to D,
leave it as it was,

418
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:51,267
and now I want to change kappa.
I'm going to move in a

419
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:56,615
dielectric.
I'd like to stay working on the

420
00:28:56,615 --> 00:29:04,256
center board  I have to change,
have to -- can't see this any

421
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:09,898
more.
So now D is as it was before,

422
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:14,951
but now kappa becomes three.
So I take dielectric and I

423
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:19,442
shove it in, and sigma free is
fixed, and so now,

424
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:23,746
what happens with E?
Well, sigma free is fixed.

425
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:27,489
If kappa, all of a sudden,
becomes three,

426
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:31,606
[krrk] E field goes down.
Is that surprising?

427
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:37,781
No, that is not surprising,
because as you move in the

428
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:42,643
dielectric, the -- this surface
charge density is not going to

429
00:29:42,643 --> 00:29:46,788
change, but you are inducing
now, on your dielectric,

430
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:51,251
negative charge here and
positive charge here as a result

431
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:56,192
of that external electric field,
and so that creates an induced

432
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:59,38
electric field in this
direction, and so,

433
00:29:59,38 --> 00:30:03,126
as a result of that,
the net electric field goes

434
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:05,836
down.
And that's what you see here,

435
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:09,039
it goes down,
in this case,

436
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,927
by a factor of three.
What happens with the potential

437
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:16,739
difference over the plates?
Well, D wasn't changing,

438
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:19,132
remember?
We kept D constant now.

439
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:23,467
So if E goes down by a factor
of three, V must go down by a

440
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:26,233
factor of three.
What happens with the

441
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:29,373
capacitance, C?
Well, the capacitor is free

442
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:32,513
charge divided by the potential
difference.

443
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:35,877
The free charge is not
changing, it's trapped.

444
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:40,181
The potential
difference goes down by a

445
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:43,915
factor of three,
capacitance goes up by a factor

446
00:30:43,915 --> 00:30:46,299
of three.
What happens with the

447
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:50,59
electrostatic potential energy?
Well, the electrostatic

448
00:30:50,59 --> 00:30:53,132
potential energy is one-half Q
V.

449
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:57,423
But Q free could not change.
V went down by a factor of

450
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,204
three.
So U must go down by a factor

451
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:03,382
of three.
That means if the electrostatic

452
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:08,626
potential energy goes down,
that as I move in this

453
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:11,939
dielectric, that I do negative
work.

454
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:16,292
If I had to push it in,
you would have gone up.

455
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:20,172
So, in a way,
as I move the dielectric in,

456
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:24,999
it's being sucked in.
There is a force that pulls it

457
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,743
in.
Interesting all by itself.

458
00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:32,096
I would like you,
at home, to go to ex- through

459
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:37,491
exactly the same questions,
verbatim, with one difference.

460
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:40,897
And that is,
you keep

461
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:45,505
the power supply connected.
Now your answers are going to

462
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:48,138
be very different.
For one thing,

463
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:52,416
if the power supply is
connected, and if you change D

464
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:57,188
-- so your power supply is
connected, and you go up in D by

465
00:31:57,188 --> 00:32:01,137
a factor of two -- the power
supply is connected,

466
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:06,073
[unintelligible] one thing now
that cannot change throughout,

467
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:09,446
and that is V.
Potential difference cannot

468
00:32:09,446 --> 00:32:13,49
change,
because the power supply is

469
00:32:13,49 --> 00:32:16,551
connected.
So now, if V cannot change,

470
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:20,274
and you increase D by a factor
of two, E, now,

471
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,838
must go down by a factor of
two.

472
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:27,057
And that's very different from
what happened before,

473
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:30,201
when E remained constant.
So it's very,

474
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:34,585
very different physics.
Well, the physics is the same,

475
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,398
but the results are very
different.

476
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:41,534
And I want you do that,
you have all the tools now,

477
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:45,919
you can believe in those
equations,

478
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,024
and they should work for you.
All right, let's visit Ohm's

479
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:56,13
Law and maybe look at Kirchoff
-- I prefer to stay on this

480
00:32:56,13 --> 00:32:58,997
center board,
convenient for you,

481
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:01,863
and it is also convenient for
me.

482
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:05,446
A very simple network,
keep in mind that,

483
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:10,193
on an exam, all problems are
extremely simple and very

484
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:13,06
fundamental.
Nothing complicated.

485
00:33:13,06 --> 00:33:17,359
You don't have the time for
that.

486
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,413
I give here a problem in which
I actually give numbers,

487
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:26,437
on the exam you won't see any
numbers, even,

488
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:30,742
not in the sense of distances,
ohms, and so on,

489
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:34,486
because there is no calculator
necessary.

490
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:39,82
But here, you will see some
numbers, this is a battery and

491
00:33:39,82 --> 00:33:43,844
this battery has an EMF,
which is ten volts.

492
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:46,371
That's a given.
Plus, minus.

493
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:52,548
And here, the current is going
to split into three.

494
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:57,053
There is R one,
which is one ohm,

495
00:33:57,053 --> 00:34:04,936
R two, which is two ohms,
and then we have R three -- put

496
00:34:04,936 --> 00:34:13,524
it a little lower -- R three is
three ohms, they come together

497
00:34:13,524 --> 00:34:18,17
here.
And here I have a resistor R

498
00:34:18,17 --> 00:34:25,433
four, which is four ohms,
and I close the loop and go

499
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:29,744
back to my battery.
Just to make it a little bit

500
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:33,688
more interesting,
I will introduce into this

501
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:38,274
battery an internal resistance
which is very small,

502
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:42,585
which is oh point one ohms.
You can't remove it,

503
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:45,52
it's intrinsic into that
battery.

504
00:34:45,52 --> 00:34:52,4
And so the first question that
I would ask you in this case is,

505
00:34:52,4 --> 00:34:56,971
what is the total current that
is going to flow?

506
00:34:56,971 --> 00:35:00,376
We're going to get a current I
here.

507
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:05,628
Through here you get I one,
through here you get I two,

508
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:10,103
through here you get I three,
I comes out here,

509
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:13,896
I goes through here,
through the fourth,

510
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:17,884
come back, and I goes through
the battery.

511
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:22,748
So what is I?
In a problem like this,

512
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:25,762
there are many roads to
success.

513
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:29,554
Not just one.
And it's a matter of taste

514
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:34,319
which one you prefer.
If I call this point A and I

515
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:38,111
call this point D,
then what I would do,

516
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:43,07
I would ask myself the
question, if this is point A,

517
00:35:43,07 --> 00:35:47,641
and this is point D,
what resistor -- which your

518
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:52,6
book calls the equivalent
resistor -- the equivalent

519
00:35:52,6 --> 00:35:57,86
resistance --
what resistor would I have put

520
00:35:57,86 --> 00:36:02,935
here, instead of these three,
for the current I to be exactly

521
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:07,671
the same as what it is now?
So I'm going to replace these

522
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:11,477
three by one resistor,
which is this imaginary

523
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:14,522
resistor.
As you have noticed in your

524
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:19,851
book, where you undoubtedly read
up on, one over R equivalent is

525
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:25,686
one over R one plus one over R
two plus one over R three.

526
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:29,82
You know all these numbers,
and so you will find our

527
00:36:29,82 --> 00:36:32,819
equivalent is oh point five five
ohms.

528
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:36,791
Check this at home,
and I hope I didn't goof up on

529
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,628
that one.
Notice that this resistor,

530
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:44,086
this equivalent resistance,
is smaller than the smallest

531
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:47,085
one, which is one ohm.
That's obvious.

532
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:51,299
It has to be that way.
Think of these as water flows.

533
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:54,947
Water flow through this one,
through this one,

534
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:57,942
and through this
one.

535
00:36:57,942 --> 00:37:01,626
Remove these two.
Water is only flowing through

536
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:04,749
this one.
Now you add these two pipes so

537
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:08,593
more water can flow,
so the equivalent resistance

538
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,155
goes down.
Same with electricity.

539
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:15,88
So the equivalent resistance of
parallel resistors is always

540
00:37:15,88 --> 00:37:20,124
lower than the smallest.
Now it's trivial to calculate

541
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:22,527
the current I,
I use Ohm's Law.

542
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:27,332
Ohm's Law says that potential
difference that is available b-

543
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:30,297
by
the battery is E,

544
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:33,024
it's ten volts,
is now the current,

545
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:37,356
the total current times all
resistances along the road.

546
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:40,965
I go once around,
I have here R e- equivalent,

547
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:44,816
then I have R four,
because the full current goes

548
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:48,185
through R four,
and then I have this little

549
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:51,393
stinky R of I.
Doesn't going to make much

550
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:55,163
difference, but it's there.
And so you can find,

551
00:37:55,163 --> 00:37:58,452
now, what I is,
because you know all other

552
00:37:58,452 --> 00:38:03,427
numbers,
and you'll find that what I --

553
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:07,472
I is my goal,
and I think I found two point

554
00:38:07,472 --> 00:38:10,458
one five amperes,
that is right.

555
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:15,08
Two point one five amperes.
So we know what I is.

556
00:38:15,08 --> 00:38:17,392
Is this the only way?
No.

557
00:38:17,392 --> 00:38:21,052
But it is one way,
it's very effective.

558
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:26,349
So now I want to know what I
one, I two, and I three is.

559
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:31,839
Well,  if I know the potential
difference between A and D,

560
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,751
V A minus V D,
that must be,

561
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:39,839
according to Ohm's Law,
I one R one.

562
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,987
If I go this route.
But since we're dealing with

563
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:48,046
conservative forces,
I can also go through this

564
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:53,253
path, the path doesn't matter,
I must get the same potential

565
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:56,959
difference.
So it's also I two times R two,

566
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,842
and so it must also be I three
times R three.

567
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:04,902
So if I only could find I two,
then, of course,

568
00:39:04,902 --> 00:39:09,7
I would know the
potential difference,

569
00:39:09,7 --> 00:39:13,725
out pops, immediately,
I one and out pops,

570
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:15,689
immediately,
I three.

571
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:21,188
And now I'm going to apply
Kirchoff's First Rule in order

572
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:24,723
to find I two.
I couldn't find I one,

573
00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:30,418
but I just decided on I two.
And Kirchoff's First Rule says

574
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:35,328
that the closed loop integral of
E dot D L -- this,

575
00:39:35,328 --> 00:39:38,47
now, is a closed loop -- is
zero.

576
00:39:38,47 --> 00:39:43,569
In the future,
you will see situations that

577
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:45,492
it's not zero.
Here, zero.

578
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:49,26
I don't know why Kirchoff got
the credit for this,

579
00:39:49,26 --> 00:39:52,952
this was long known before him,
but nevertheless,

580
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:55,49
it's called Kirchoff's First
Rule.

581
00:39:55,49 --> 00:39:59,489
So I go with closed path,
and this is the closed path

582
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:04,027
that I have decided to take.
And that closed loop integral E

583
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:07,795
dot D L must be zero.
Any other path would also be

584
00:40:07,795 --> 00:40:11,795
zero.
I chose the one through R two,

585
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:14,372
because my goal is to find I
two.

586
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:17,756
Once I have I two,
I want an I three follow

587
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:20,737
immediately from this.
I have decided,

588
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:24,603
very arbitrarily,
that if I go down in potential,

589
00:40:24,603 --> 00:40:29,195
then I will call that -- I will
give that a negative sign,

590
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:33,948
and if I go down in potential,
I will give that a plus sign.

591
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:37,654
You can reverse that.
That makes no difference,

592
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:42,327
because the sum of them is
going to be zero

593
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:44,806
anyhow.
So I will stick to my

594
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:49,235
convention for now,
that if I go down in potential,

595
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:53,841
I will give it a minus sign,
if I go up in potential,

596
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,789
plus sign.
I go, first,

597
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,092
from A to D,
through R two.

598
00:40:58,092 --> 00:41:02,078
The current is I two.
The resistance is R two.

599
00:41:02,078 --> 00:41:07,215
And I go down in potential.
So I get my first term is minus

600
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,961
I two times R two.
I'm now at D.

601
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,441
I started at A,
I'm now at D.

602
00:41:12,441 --> 00:41:17,125
I went through two.
I come out here,

603
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:19,516
and I go through four,
R four.

604
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:23,802
I go down in potential.
The current through R four is

605
00:41:23,802 --> 00:41:25,945
I.
So I get minus I R four.

606
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:29,737
I go up, and I see this battery
in front of me,

607
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,622
and I have to climb up in
potential.

608
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:37,238
How much do I have to climb up?
That EMF, of the battery.

609
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:41,854
But that dinky toy little
resistance R of I makes me down

610
00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:45,234
a little bit,
and so I get another minus I

611
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:48,788
times R
of I, and that,

612
00:41:48,788 --> 00:41:52,871
now, is zero.
And that's one equation with

613
00:41:52,871 --> 00:41:56,058
only one unknown,
which is I two,

614
00:41:56,058 --> 00:42:01,535
because we already have I.
That's the two point one five

615
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:04,223
amperes.
And so you'll find,

616
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:08,605
now, that I two becomes oh
point six amperes.

617
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:13,982
And so you know now that V A
minus V D is the potential

618
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:20,056
difference, which was I two R
two, is now going

619
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:24,676
to be one point two volts.
Because I two is oh point six

620
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:29,296
amperes, but R two -- there's a
two here -- is two ohms.

621
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:34,168
So it's one point two volts.
And so the one point two volts

622
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:38,368
is also I one R one,
and it's also I three R three,

623
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:41,392
so you get I one and you get I
three.

624
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,004
What is the power delivered by
this battery?

625
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:48,448
That is the EMF times the total
current I.

626
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:51,884
We know the EMF,
ten volts.

627
00:42:51,884 --> 00:42:55,795
The total current is two point
one five amperes.

628
00:42:55,795 --> 00:42:58,957
So this is twenty one point
five watts.

629
00:42:58,957 --> 00:43:01,786
How does that show up,
that energy?

630
00:43:01,786 --> 00:43:04,948
Well, it comes out in the form
of heat.

631
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:07,361
Heat in R four,
heat in R one,

632
00:43:07,361 --> 00:43:09,941
R two, and R three,
and a teeny,

633
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:15,1
weeny little bit of heat inside
that battery because of that oh

634
00:43:15,1 --> 00:43:17,846
point one ohm internal
resistance.

635
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:23,088
How much power comes out in
resistance R two?

636
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:26,343
Well, that is,
of course, the potential

637
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:30,626
difference over R two,
which was that V A minus V D

638
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:34,48
times the current through R two.
That's power,

639
00:43:34,48 --> 00:43:38,163
power is potential difference
times current.

640
00:43:38,163 --> 00:43:42,274
This is the total power
delivered by the battery.

641
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:47,156
That is the total potential
difference available times the

642
00:43:47,156 --> 00:43:49,554
total current.
But of course,

643
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:55,742
R two only sees a potential
difference which is one point

644
00:43:55,742 --> 00:44:00,746
two volts, and it has an I two
which is only oh point six

645
00:44:00,746 --> 00:44:05,123
amperes, so this is only oh
point seven two watts.

646
00:44:05,123 --> 00:44:10,484
So that is the number of joules
per second, in terms of heat,

647
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:15,487
that is produced in R two.
I think you'll believe me when

648
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,614
I say that the top is still
running.

649
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:24,242
And the clue I will give you is
that the answer lies in eight oh

650
00:44:24,242 --> 00:44:28,068
two.
Give it some thought,

651
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:33,452
it's a very cute t- top.
All right, let's talk about

652
00:44:33,452 --> 00:44:39,153
kinetic energy increase due to
charges that move over a

653
00:44:39,153 --> 00:44:43,693
potential difference.
I have two conductors,

654
00:44:43,693 --> 00:44:47,916
very funny in shape,
but they are equally

655
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:55,413
potentials, there's no current
running inside the conductors.

656
00:44:55,413 --> 00:44:59,295
And so conductor A is at a
potential V of A,

657
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:02,906
this is conductor A,
potential is V of A,

658
00:45:02,906 --> 00:45:07,24
and this is conductor be,
ahs a potential V of B,

659
00:45:07,24 --> 00:45:11,213
and let's assume that V A is
larger than V B.

660
00:45:11,213 --> 00:45:15,276
If you want to change that
later, that's fine.

661
00:45:15,276 --> 00:45:20,061
We put the whole thing in
vacuum, because I'm going to

662
00:45:20,061 --> 00:45:24,847
release a charge here,
plus Q, and the charge will now

663
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,794
go
to B.

664
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:29,843
Electric field configuration is
a zoo.

665
00:45:29,843 --> 00:45:33,387
I don't even want to think
about what it is.

666
00:45:33,387 --> 00:45:36,436
One way or another,
if this is vacuum,

667
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:39,651
than this charge will finds it
way to B.

668
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:43,195
Let's say this is the routing
that it takes.

669
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:46,491
It ends up on B,
and the question now is,

670
00:45:46,491 --> 00:45:51,354
what is the speed at which it
reaches B if I release it here

671
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:54,98
at zero speed?
So the electric field is going

672
00:45:54,98 --> 00:45:58,762
to
do work on this charge,

673
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:01,915
and the work,
in going from A to B,

674
00:46:01,915 --> 00:46:05,347
integral A to B,
is the force dot D L.

675
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:09,15
That is the electric force on
that charge.

676
00:46:09,15 --> 00:46:14,437
Since it a conservative field,
it doesn't matter what your

677
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:19,631
routing is, you will always get
the same answer for this.

678
00:46:19,631 --> 00:46:25,382
That electric force is also the
force times the electric field,

679
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:29,927
at any location along the line.
And

680
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:33,728
so you see, you get here a Q
times E D L.

681
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:39,431
But the integral of E D L is
the potential difference between

682
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:42,282
the two.
And so the net result,

683
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:47,51
therefore, is that the work
done by the electric fields,

684
00:46:47,51 --> 00:46:53,308
when this charge finally ends
up here, that work is the charge

685
00:46:53,308 --> 00:46:57,68
Q times the potential difference
V A minus V B,

686
00:46:57,68 --> 00:47:02,907
regardless of which path it
chooses to go.

687
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:06,829
Let's take a practical case,
we have a proton which has a

688
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:10,68
mass one point seven times ten
to the minus twenty seven

689
00:47:10,68 --> 00:47:13,41
kilograms.
The charge of the pro- proton

690
00:47:13,41 --> 00:47:17,261
is the same of that of the
electron, but it is positive.

691
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:21,042
One point six times ten to the
minus nineteen Coulombs.

692
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:24,963
And let's suppose that the
potential difference between A

693
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:29,375
and B, this is now the potential
difference, is a million volts.

694
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:34,797
Uh, let me put a delta here,
because I don't want Vs on both

695
00:47:34,797 --> 00:47:37,52
sides.
But that's the difference V A

696
00:47:37,52 --> 00:47:40,321
minus V B.
So what is now the kinetic

697
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:43,355
energy with which this proton
reaches B?

698
00:47:43,355 --> 00:47:47,322
So that kinetic energy must be
Q times the potential

699
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:51,834
difference, so that is one point
six times ten to the minus

700
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:56,58
nineteen, times ten to the six,
so that is one point six times

701
00:47:56,58 --> 00:47:59,069
ten to the minus thirteen
joules.

702
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:03,815
Almost no physicist would call
this one point six times ten to

703
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:07,043
the minus
thirteen joules,

704
00:48:07,043 --> 00:48:10,073
but we would say,
the kinetic energy of that

705
00:48:10,073 --> 00:48:13,385
proton is one M E V,
one million electron volts.

706
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:17,331
And the reason why we do that
is, an electron volt is the

707
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:21,347
energy that an electron gains if
it moves over a potential

708
00:48:21,347 --> 00:48:24,941
difference of one volt.
That's the definition of one

709
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:28,112
electron volt.
Though the charge of the proton

710
00:48:28,112 --> 00:48:31,987
is that same of that of an
electron, and it moves over a

711
00:48:31,987 --> 00:48:37,152
distance of one million volts,
and so the energy is one

712
00:48:37,152 --> 00:48:41,161
million electron volts.
But this is not an SI unit,

713
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:43,485
so be careful.
If you work SI,

714
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:47,895
you've got to use this number.
But we would say that's a

715
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:52,865
proton with a kinetic energy of
one M E V, one million electron

716
00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:55,59
volts.
So what is the speed with at

717
00:48:55,59 --> 00:48:58,075
which it finally,
then, arrives?

718
00:48:58,075 --> 00:49:02,965
Well, one-half M P squared is
this number, this is the mass of

719
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:07,856
the proton, this is the speed
that the proton

720
00:49:07,856 --> 00:49:11,967
arrives at point B,
and when you use that number,

721
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:16,934
the mass, you will find that
the velocity of that proton is

722
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:22,159
about one point four times ten
to the seven meters per second,

723
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,356
which is about five percent of
the speed of light.

724
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:29,439
In other words,
we don't have to make

725
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:33,807
relativistic corrections.
This answer is believable.

726
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:38,09
Several students have sent me
e-mail,

727
00:49:38,09 --> 00:49:40,768
and they have asked me for
practice exams.

728
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:44,165
I am equally surprised,
as you are, that the previous

729
00:49:44,165 --> 00:49:47,365
lecturers of eight oh two did
not list on the web,

730
00:49:47,365 --> 00:49:48,868
on their website,
exams.

731
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:51,089
They didn't.
I was hoping they did,

732
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:53,31
but they didn't.
Professor Belcher,

733
00:49:53,31 --> 00:49:56,772
however, mentioned one
particular practice exam to me,

734
00:49:56,772 --> 00:50:00,756
and when you visit the eight oh
two website, you can find that

735
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:03,565
practice exam,
but there are no solutions on

736
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:06,048
that exam.
So you can discuss this exam

737
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:09,96
with your instructors,
with your tutors,

738
00:50:09,96 --> 00:50:13,078
I am available if you want to
discuss it with me,

739
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:17,039
I have no problems with that --
it's a little difficult for me

740
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,676
to help six hundred students,
but I can help quite a few.

741
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:24,507
But my advice is that you take
the study guide if you really

742
00:50:24,507 --> 00:50:28,079
want to do more practice,
and go over some problems that

743
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,066
have worked-out solutions.
And I wish you luck,

744
00:50:31,066 --> 50:36
and I'll see you next Friday.
