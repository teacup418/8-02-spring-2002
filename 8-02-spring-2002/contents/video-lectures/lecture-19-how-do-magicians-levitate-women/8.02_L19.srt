00:00:00 --> 00:00:00,171



2
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:04,61
You have ten days left for your
motor, so that's a nice project

3
00:00:04,61 --> 00:00:07,617
for Spring Break.
I'll give you some hints.

4
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:11,125
Keep the friction of your rotor
as low as you can.

5
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,849
You can't use any oil,
of course; that's not allowed.

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,569
Balance your rotor to the best
you can.

7
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:21,006
And try to avoid that the rotor
begins to bounce,

8
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:24,228
begins to vibrate,
because when it vibrates it

9
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:28,524
loses contact with the current
when it needs it so there's no

10
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:32,98
torque.
How will we test your motors?

11
00:00:32,98 --> 00:00:38,549
We do it with a stroboscope,
and I've decided to demonstrate

12
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,664
to you how we're going to do
that.

13
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:45,062
That's probably the best thing
to do.

14
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:49,215
We have a disk,
and we're going to rotate the

15
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,557
disk at thousand RPM.
Let's assume that is your

16
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:56,767
motor.
And we're going to strobe it

17
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:02,052
with a strobe light until it
stands still.

18
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:05,748
In this case,
I have set the strobe so that

19
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:10,147
it will stand still,
roughly, and the strobe is now

20
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:14,635
going at five hundred RPM,
and the motor is going at

21
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:18,066
thousand RPM.
So this clearly is not the

22
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:23,169
rotation rate of your motor.
In fact, your motor goes twice

23
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:28,185
around between the blinks.
And we'd have no way of knowing

24
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:31
that, so we double the
frequency.

25
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37,141
I'm trying to double it now,
double the frequency of the

26
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:42,294
blinking of the strobe light.
And now it stands still again.

27
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:47,272
So now we may think that your
motor is going thousand RPM,

28
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:51,901
but we don't know yet.
Maybe it's going three thousand

29
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:55,831
R- two thousand RPM.
Maybe three thousand RPM.

30
00:01:55,831 --> 00:02:00,721
So what are we going to do now,
we're going to double the

31
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,778
frequency.
And so we go now with the

32
00:02:03,778 --> 00:02:06,573
strobe light to two thousand
RPM.

33
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:11,192
And what we see now is
we see a double image.

34
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:14,148
So two thousand RPM is out,
and any multiple of two

35
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:16,985
thousand RPM is out.
So four thousand RPM is out,

36
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,291
six thousand,
and eight thousand is out.

37
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,72
But what is not yet out is
three thousand and five thousand

38
00:02:22,72 --> 00:02:25,498
and seven thousand.
So we would have to test for

39
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:26,858
that.
On the other hand,

40
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:30,168
I told you already that this
motor is going thousand RPM,

41
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:32,474
so there's no sense us testing
that now.

42
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:36,08
But during the actual contest,
of course, we will continue all

43
00:02:36,08 --> 00:02:39,627
the way until we are convinced
that we have the right RPM for

44
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:44,055
your motor.
And so that's the way we will

45
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:46,873
do it.
We will put a little bit of

46
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:52,255
white paint on one side of your
rotor, so that's the way it will

47
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,244
be done.
Of course, if your motor is

48
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:58,832
highly unstable in terms of
rotation rates,

49
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:03,018
it will not be easy to get a
right correct number.

50
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:06,349
I want to talk with you about
the heart.

51
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,595
The heart, our heart has four
chambers.

52
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:15,486
Looks sort of like this.
The left atrium and right

53
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,148
atrium.
Maybe this is why it's -- this

54
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:24,79
is why it's called the heart.
And here is the left and the

55
00:03:24,79 --> 00:03:29,74
ri- and the right ventricle.
And here is the aorta.

56
00:03:29,74 --> 00:03:34,293
The sole purpose of the heart
is to pump blood.

57
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:40,034
About five quarts per minute,
which is seventy-five gallons

58
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:44,191
per hour, which is seventy
barrels per day,

59
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:50,575
which is about two million
barrels in seventy-five years.

60
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:54,05
And it pumps about seventy
times per minute.

61
00:03:54,05 --> 00:03:58,495
If the blood to your brain
stops for about five seconds,

62
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:02,374
you lose consciousness.
So it's five skips of the

63
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:05,525
heartbeat, and you're down on
the floor.

64
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:09,243
And four minutes later,
permanent brain damage.

65
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:13,364
The way the heart works is
absolutely mind-boggling.

66
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:18,86
Extremely complicated.
Nature had one billion years to

67
00:04:18,86 --> 00:04:22,853
design it, but nevertheless
it's impressive.

68
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:26,754
Each heart cell is a mini
chemical battery,

69
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:30,562
and it pumps ions in or out as
it pleases.

70
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:35,298
In the normal state,
each heart cell is minus eighty

71
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:39,756
millivolts on the inside
relative to the outside.

72
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:44,678
There are some cells which are
called pacemaker cells.

73
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:48,858
They are located in a very
small

74
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:52,671
area, about one square
millimeter, near the atrium,

75
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:56,332
the right atrium,
and they change their potential

76
00:04:56,332 --> 00:05:00,451
from minus eighty millivolts to
plus twenty millivolts.

77
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:03,578
Now why they do that is a
different story,

78
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:07,545
which I will not address.
Once they go to plus twenty

79
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:10,595
millivolts, the neighboring
cells follow,

80
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:13,341
and a wave propagates over the
heart.

81
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:15,706
I'll make you a drawing
shortly.

82
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:19,977
So the wave first moves over
the atrial chambers and then

83
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:23,656
over the
ventricle chambers.

84
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:28,259
And when the cells are at plus
twenty millivolts inside

85
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,498
relative to the outside,
they contract.

86
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,589
So they form a muscle.
The whole heart is one big

87
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:38,828
muscle.
And after about two tenths of a

88
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:43,175
second, the cells return to
minus eighty millivolts,

89
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:46,414
and this wave goes from below
to above.

90
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:51,528
And then the whole thing waits
again for another message from

91
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:57,093
the pacemaker cells.
Takes about one second,

92
00:05:57,093 --> 00:06:01,652
and then the whole process
starts all over.

93
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:07,404
Now I want to be more precise.
Here is one heart cell.

94
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:11,312
So this is about ten microns in
size.

95
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:17,173
And this cell has eighty
millivolts with respect to the

96
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:21,189
outside.
So that means it has repelled

97
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:27,375
positive ions,
and so the inside is negative.

98
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,805
And there is no E field here
outside, because if you put a

99
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:36,39
Gaussian surface around here,
there is no net charge inside.

100
00:06:36,39 --> 00:06:39,498
But there is,
of course, a electric field

101
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:42,684
across the walls here,
from plus to minus.

102
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:46,88
Now the depolarization,
which is the change to the plus

103
00:06:46,88 --> 00:06:51,154
twenty millivolt state starts,
and it starts from above.

104
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:55,506
And I will assume now that it
is not plus twenty but zero

105
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:59,391
millivolts, and it's easier to
see.

106
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,237
If we have this cell,
and the wave is,

107
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:05,159
say, halfway down,
and this is now zero

108
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,695
millivolts, then there is no
longer minus charge here and no

109
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,309
longer plus charge here,
because zero millivolts

110
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:17,846
relative to the outside world.
So there is no electric field

111
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:20,691
across here anymore.
[unintelligible].

112
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,613
In other words,
what the cell has done,

113
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:26,227
it has moved positive ions back
in.

114
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:31,302
But here the situation is still
as it was before,

115
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:35,883
so this is still at your minus
eighty millivolts.

116
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:40,653
And if you look now,
you have here a minus layer on

117
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:44,279
top of a positive layer.
Positive here,

118
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,192
minus on top.
And that creates an electric

119
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:53,44
field, which has roughly the
shape of a electric dipole.

120
00:07:53,44 --> 00:07:58,115
It has this shape.
So as the wave goes through the

121
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:02,996
cells, only then do they
create a dipole.

122
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:05,95
And we call this the
depolarization.

123
00:08:05,95 --> 00:08:10,085
A little later in time,
when this wave has passed,

124
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:13,545
the whole thing is plus twenty
millivolts.

125
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:17,258
I chose zero here,
but it really goes to plus

126
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:20,465
twenty.
This is just easier to explain.

127
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:23,926
So that means that now the
inside is plus,

128
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:28,061
so positive ions are now
inside, negative ions are

129
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:31,69
outside, and the E field here is
again zero.

130
00:08:31,69 --> 00:08:36,331
Now there is the repolarization
wave,

131
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:40,34
which comes from below,
when it goes back to minus

132
00:08:40,34 --> 00:08:44,103
eighty millivolts.
And I will again do the same

133
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:48,521
trick that I did before;
I will just assume the wave is

134
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:53,02
halfway, that it is not minus
eighty but that it is zero

135
00:08:53,02 --> 00:08:56,292
millivolts.
So there are no charges here,

136
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:59,074
but the charges here are
unchanged.

137
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:03,818
So what do you have now here?
You have a minus layer on top

138
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:08,399
of a plus layer.
So you have exactly what

139
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,562
you had before.
So again you get an electric

140
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:16,919
field, [unintelligible] electric
dipole field,

141
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,63
which has again the same shape.
So what's going to happen is

142
00:09:22,63 --> 00:09:28,729
the depolarization wave is going
to run down, leaves behind here

143
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:33,473
the cells at plus twenty
millivolts, when they are

144
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:38,894
contracted, so this part of the
heart has already pumped,

145
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:43,993
and it moves down.
And only the cells where the

146
00:09:43,993 --> 00:09:47,665
depolarization occurs,
that's only the ones on the

147
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:51,111
ring, contribute to that
electric dipole field.

148
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:54,783
If there is no wave,
which is sizeable fraction of

149
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:57,855
the heart, of the cycle,
there is no wave,

150
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:00,702
then there is no electric
dipole field.

151
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:04,823
And when the repolarization
goes in the other direction,

152
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:09,018
when the heart relaxes because
the cells go back to minus

153
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:13,964
eighty millivolts,
then again there is an electric

154
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:18,081
dipole field,
but only from the cells through

155
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:21,356
which the repolarization wave
moves.

156
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:26,783
And you can very easily see
that the electric dipole fields

157
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:30,713
of all these cells here support
each other.

158
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,456
So you get a dipole field from
the heart.

159
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:39,789
And so if I make you look at
your heart -- so this is you,

160
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:44
this is your body,
your legs, and this is your

161
00:10:44 --> 00:10:49,685
arms, and here is
your heart, and there goes this

162
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:52,549
wave.
And so here is your electric

163
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:56,628
field that is generated while
the wave is going,

164
00:10:56,628 --> 00:11:00,707
either depolarization down or
repolarization up.

165
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:05,48
But if there is an electric
field, there's going to be a

166
00:11:05,48 --> 00:11:10,427
potential difference between
different parts of your body.

167
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:15,113
You look here at your belly
button, and you follow this

168
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:18,78
electric field
line at your head,

169
00:11:18,78 --> 00:11:22,079
there is an E field.
The integral E dot D L gives

170
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,514
you a potential difference.
And so now you see that

171
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:29,706
there're going to be potential
differences between the various

172
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:33,004
parts of your body.
And that's the idea behind an

173
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:36,027
electrocardiogram.
Typically there are twelve

174
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:40,081
electrodes attached to arms,
legs, head, and chest to get as

175
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,967
much information about the heart
as we can.

176
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:46,197
And the maximum potential
difference between two

177
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:50,595
electrodes, in general,
is not more than about

178
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:58,571
two to three millivolts.
I'd like to show you a healthy

179
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:04,037
heart cardiogram,
of a healthy person.

180
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:10,389
I have that here.
The time here is about one

181
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:18,071
second, and from here to here is
about one millivolt.

182
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:23,533
The P wave --
we call this the P wave -- that

183
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,96
is observed when the atrium is
being depolarized,

184
00:12:26,96 --> 00:12:30,672
so when the depolarization wave
goes over the atrium.

185
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:35,098
A little later it goes over the
ventricle, and you get a larger

186
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:39,024
potential difference because
there is more muscle in the

187
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,737
ventricle.
So that's why this R wave is

188
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:43,45
higher.
The T wave is the

189
00:12:43,45 --> 00:12:46,52
repolarization,
when the wave goes back over

190
00:12:46,52 --> 00:12:49,804
the ventricles.
The dipole field is in the same

191
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:53,759
direction, remember.
That's the T wave.

192
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,452
It's not known,
at least it wasn't known

193
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:59,628
recent- until recently,
what causes the U wave.

194
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:03,495
I talked to a heart expert
about this, Professor Cohen at

195
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:07,43
MIT, and I was surprised to
learn that it's not known what

196
00:13:07,43 --> 00:13:10,952
the U wave is about.
Not everyone's cardiogram looks

197
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:14,473
as healthy as this one.
There is a terrible disease,

198
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:18,34
which four hundred thousand
people die of per year in the

199
00:13:18,34 --> 00:13:22,482
United States,
which is known as ventricular

200
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:25,719
fibrillation,
also known as sudden death.

201
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:30,411
The ventricles fire without any
message from the pace wave,

202
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,242
pacemaker wave,
and there is random,

203
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:37,773
non-synchronous depolarization.
So the heart doesn't pump

204
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:41,575
anymore, in five seconds you
lose consciousness,

205
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:44,569
on the floor,
and in four minutes you,

206
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:47,077
um, have permanent brain
damage.

207
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,07
In hospitals,
heart patients are being

208
00:13:50,07 --> 00:13:54,029
monitored,
and as soon as it's noticed

209
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:57,708
that there is something wrong
like this, so severe as the

210
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,205
fibrillation,
ventricular fibrillation,

211
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:02,834
then they apply electric shock
treatment.

212
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,119
So you have to be fast,
you only have a few minutes

213
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:09,733
before you get brain damage.
And three thousand volts is

214
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:13,084
applied, one amperes,
for about a tenth of a second.

215
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:16,567
Large plates are being used on
each side of the chest.

216
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,852
And this, of course,
is enough to kill the patient.

217
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:23,86
But it makes little difference,
because the patient would have

218
00:14:23,86 --> 00:14:26,061
died
anyhow.

219
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:30,957
Heart patients can also get
synchronization problems and

220
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:35,053
then they implant a pacemaker
that's a circuit.

221
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:40,038
And this pacemaker takes over
the role from the pacemaker

222
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:43,154
cells.
When the heartbeat rate falls

223
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:47,695
below a certain rate,
the artificial pacemaker takes

224
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,9
over.
About ten milliamperes for half

225
00:14:50,9 --> 00:14:54,817
a millisecond,
and it does it sixty times per

226
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:58,423
minute.
And so it triggers,

227
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:02,523
then, the depolarization wave.
These pacemakers are

228
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:06,46
susceptible to influences from
the outside world,

229
00:15:06,46 --> 00:15:10,397
and one person's pacemaker
stopped, for instance,

230
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:14,989
every ten seconds due to a
radar sweep from a police car.

231
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:19,582
It's also possible that you get
a built-in defibrillator,

232
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:22,699
in other words,
a system that gives you

233
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:28,44
electric shocks when sudden
death might otherwise occur.

234
00:15:28,44 --> 00:15:32,527
So it senses that something is
wrong, that the ventricle is

235
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:35,628
going into fibrillation,
and then it applies,

236
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:38,306
all by itself,
six hundred fifty volts,

237
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,702
about five and a half
milliseconds,

238
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:44,579
up to five to ten amperes.
And that's not enough to kill

239
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:49,019
the patient, and the whole idea
is sort of a wake-up call to the

240
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,908
heart to get it back into
synchronization,

241
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:55,855
to get this depolarization wave
being synchronized again.

242
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:59,943
So clearly I would like to show
now a heart cardiogram of a

243
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:03,975
student,
and I prefer to have a healthy

244
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:07,31
one to avoid some difficulties.
You feel strong?

245
00:16:07,31 --> 00:16:10,788
You a healthy person?
You don't mind volunteering?

246
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:13,768
Tight pants,
we have to do something about.

247
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:16,465
OK, why don't you sit down.
[laughter].

248
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:18,878
Well, there's nothing I -- come
in.

249
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,865
We'll, we'll,
we will, we'll,

250
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:24,272
we'll find a way.
All right, so we have to attach

251
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:28,033
-- we don't have twelve
electrodes, we only use three.

252
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:33,284
And the first one -- that's why
I was worried about your

253
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,829
tight pants.
Can you roll them up a little?

254
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,023
OK.
Oh, this one goes here.

255
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:42,146
Let's hope that it makes good
contact.

256
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:46,45
Now the others go on your arm,
and we need very good

257
00:16:46,45 --> 00:16:50,163
electrical contact,
and therefore we put some

258
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:54,973
conducting grease on there.
It will make it a little -- it

259
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,699
will make it a bit of a mess,
but we'll give you a chance

260
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:05,101
later to clean up.
So let's first put this one --

261
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:07,099
you're relaxed,
right?

262
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,382
Yes, of course.
So can you roll up your sleeve

263
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:12,905
there?
Very good.

264
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:16,997
And mayb- oh,
oh, and maybe you can put this

265
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:20,614
over your arm,
yeah, over your -- yeah,

266
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:22,517
that's good.
High up.

267
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:25,277
Oh man, boy,
you have muscles.

268
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,418
[laughter].
All right, just relax.

269
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:33,271
If it hurts a little,
oh well, that's the way it is.

270
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:38,837
[laughter].
We need, we ne- we need good

271
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:41,839
contact.
OK, now your other arm.

272
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,13
Again, a little bit of gooky
stuff.

273
00:17:45,13 --> 00:17:50,746
Oh, you need another rubber
band, so put it around your arm

274
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:52,682
high up.
That's good,

275
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:54,134
yeah.
All right.

276
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:59,749
So now it's very important that
you relax, because when you

277
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:03,622
start moving,
the other muscle cells will

278
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:08,656
also produce electric dipole
fields.

279
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:14,273
And that we don't want,
because then that will be

280
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:16,964
overpowering.
All right.

281
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:22,697
I'm going to take -- make you
take a look at this.

282
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:24,92
Yeah?
Everything OK?

283
00:18:24,92 --> 00:18:31,589
So I'm going to change the
light situation so that you can

284
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:35,567
see shortly there what's coming
up.

285
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,609
Oh, man.
What a da- oh gee,

286
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:42,939
look at this.
Oh, gee.

287
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,813
Oh, look!
I see your -- I don't see your

288
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:47,139
P wave.
[laughter].

289
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:50,308
But you have an amazing T wave,
right -- no,

290
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:54,878
no, you have an amazing R wave!
It looks like your R wave is in

291
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:57,162
the wrong direction.
[laughter].

292
00:18:57,162 --> 00:18:59,005
You feel OK though,
right?

293
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:03,5
Yeah, I can't see your P wave.
Well, maybe some people survive

294
00:19:03,5 --> 00:19:05,49
without P waves.
[laughter].

295
00:19:05,49 --> 00:19:08,806
It's a certainly an unusual,
an unusual heart,

296
00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:13,154
but if you tell me that you are
healthy,

297
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:15,254
then I'll take your word for
that.

298
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,181
I think it would be nice if you
show class now,

299
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:22,125
why don't you just stand up for
a while, let your other muscles

300
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,734
begin to act,
and y- they will see then --

301
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:27,469
just stand up.
You will see -- move a little

302
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:29,314
bit your arms.
Move your arms.

303
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:31,796
You see?
Now you get the electric dipole

304
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,358
field from the other muscles in
the body [laughter] which

305
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,776
contract.
This is even more interesting

306
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,048
than your heart,
man.

307
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:40,384
[laughter].
All right.

308
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:42,675
Sit down again and let's take
it off.

309
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:47,073
And then you can clean up.
Looks good.

310
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:50,534
Yeah.
Heart cardiograms are not so

311
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:55,149
easy to interpret.
But I think you're looking

312
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:58,085
fine.
And you feel all right,

313
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:00,497
right?
That's important.

314
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:04,588
So thank you very much for
volunteering,

315
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:07,419
very courageous.
[applause].

316
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:12,139
Yeah, make sure you clean that
stuff off, huh.

317
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:16,124
It's water-soluble,
so it's not so bad.

318
00:20:16,124 --> 00:20:19,166
What is your name,
by the way?

319
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:23,57
Danny.
You were great,

320
00:20:23,57 --> 00:20:26,135
Danny.
[laughter].

321
00:20:26,135 --> 0.

322
0. --> 00:20:30,509
And now I want to talk about
Now I want to talk about

323
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:37,599
Aurora Borealis.
If we have a magnetic field and

324
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:45,141
we have a charged particle,
let's say make it plus,

325
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:52,834
and the velocity of that
charged particle is in this

326
00:20:52,834 --> 00:21:00,051
direction,
then the force on that charged

327
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:05,239
particle, the Lorenz force,
equals Q times V cross V.

328
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:11,025
I'm going to decompose this
velocity now into one component

329
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:16,014
parallel to the magnetic field
and into a component

330
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:21,9
perpendicular to the magnetic
field, so the vectorial sum of

331
00:21:21,9 --> 00:21:26,39
these two is V.
And so I can rewrite this as Q

332
00:21:26,39 --> 00:21:31,278
times V parallel plus V
perpendicular

333
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:35,273
crossed with V.
But V parallel crossed with V

334
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:40,63
is zero, because the angle is
either zero degrees or hundred

335
00:21:40,63 --> 00:21:44,444
eighty degrees,
so the sine of the angle is

336
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:47,712
zero.
And so the force is exclusively

337
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:52,161
determined by this term.
It's by the perpendicular

338
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:55,884
component.
And so what is going to happen,

339
00:21:55,884 --> 00:22:01,423
this charged particle is going
to circle around.

340
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:05,971
But then it continues to go in
this direction with that

341
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:10,099
velocity V parallel.
And so you are going to see a

342
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:13,89
path like this.
Well, by this radius R of that

343
00:22:13,89 --> 00:22:18,775
circle, that radius i- I still
remember it from the lecture

344
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:23,071
when we discussed that,
that was M V divided by Q B,

345
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:28,21
but the V now is of course the
perpendicular component divided

346
00:22:28,21 --> 00:22:32,927
by Q B, and then in this
direction it continues unaltered

347
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:37,97
with the
velocity which is the parallel

348
00:22:37,97 --> 00:22:41,904
component.
Magnetic field of the earth,

349
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:48,426
it's not a straight line but is
curved, and so charged particles

350
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:54,534
can spiral around the magnetic
field and follow the magnetic

351
00:22:54,534 --> 00:23:00,538
field lines, and they come down
on Earth where the magnetic

352
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:05,093
field lines enter,
which is near the magnetic

353
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,886
poles.
The sun emits a plasma.

354
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:12,746
Plasma is highly ionized
electrons and protons.

355
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:16,941
We call that the solar wind.
Sometimes it's strong,

356
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:21,136
sometimes it's weak.
And when it reaches the Earth,

357
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:24,827
it ionizes the upper atmosphere
of the Earth,

358
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:29,106
and then it produces light.
The light is very faint,

359
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:33,301
can only be seen at night.
And that light is called

360
00:23:33,301 --> 00:23:38,167
Aurora, and we here call it
Northern Lights,

361
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,793
but I'm sure that people in the
southern hemisphere,

362
00:23:41,793 --> 00:23:45,846
they call it Southern Lights.
When the sun is very active,

363
00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:49,401
it can be breathtaking,
really absolutely fabulous.

364
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:53,453
The Aurora can change very
fast, on time scales of seconds

365
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:55,728
to minutes.
And it is, of course,

366
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:59,923
strongest near the magnetic
poles, and so you r- rarely ever

367
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:03,335
see it in Boston.
It can have very bright colors,

368
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:05,895
red, green, white is the most
common.

369
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:11,004
And the color that you will see
depends on the energy of the

370
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:13,003
charged particles as they come
in.

371
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:16,577
But it also depends on whether
the nitrogen molecules in the

372
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:19,727
atmosphere or the oxygen
molecules are being excited.

373
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:23,362
Also depends on at what height,
what height in the atmosphere

374
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,512
the ionization occurs.
I've seen it quite a few times

375
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:28,996
in my life.
I did hiking in the Adirondack

376
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:31,601
where I saw it.
I've seen it from Calgary in

377
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,782
Canada.
But whenever I fly to Europe,

378
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:37,235
and flights are always at
night, I always ask for a window

379
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:40,567
seat on the left side of the
plane,

380
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:45,105
and that's the reason.
So that I can look to the

381
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:50,995
north, and a few times have I
seen spectacular Aurora from the

382
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:54,567
plane.
I want to show you some slides.

383
00:24:54,567 --> 00:25:00,168
If you visit the eight oh two
website I made some links for

384
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:03,741
you to some fabulous slides of
Aurora.

385
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:08,472
But now I want to show you a
few that I have here.

386
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:13,589
Can I have the first slide?
This is, um,

387
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:17,131
white Aurora,
and like a nice curtain.

388
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:21,342
Not so uncommon.
Can change on time scales of

389
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:26,032
minutes to seconds.
As I said, you can only see it

390
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:28,424
at night.
It's very faint.

391
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:32,348
The next slide?
You see another remarkable

392
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:35,315
example of Aurora,
white Aurora.

393
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:38,57
Strange shapes,
very unpredictable.

394
00:25:38,57 --> 00:25:42,685
And the moving,
it's like looking at a movie

395
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:49,768
when you actually see Aurora.
The next one is red Aurora,

396
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:52,506
like a wonderful curtain coming
down.

397
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:56,004
For reasons that are not so
easy to understand,

398
00:25:56,004 --> 00:26:00,72
maximum light comes from a ring
which is, which has a radius of

399
00:26:00,72 --> 00:26:04,675
about five hundred kilometers
from the magnetic pole.

400
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:09,238
And the next slide shows you a
picture taken from a satellite

401
00:26:09,238 --> 00:26:12,737
which is three Earth radii away
from the Earth.

402
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,323
This is taken in ultraviolet
light.

403
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:19,354
And you see beautiful this,
this ring.

404
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:22,944
So this radius is roughly five
hundred kilometers,

405
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:25,654
and here is one of the magnetic
poles.

406
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:30,124
I don't know whether it's the
North Pole or the South Magnetic

407
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:32,542
Pole.
And the next slide shows you

408
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:36,132
something similar.
If you look only at these four,

409
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:39,648
they are taken twelve minutes
apart, again in UV,

410
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:43,678
and you see here a crossbar.
I don't know how to explain

411
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:46,536
that crossbar.
It's called Theta Aurora.

412
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:51,142
Obviously why theta goes
without saying,

413
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,638
right.
Amazing.

414
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:58,302
And this is sort of -- these
are twelve minutes apart,

415
00:26:58,302 --> 00:27:04,179
so that gives you also an idea
how fast this can change.

416
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:09,522
Over here it's very dark and
here it's very bright.

417
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:13,048
So the changes are quite
dramatic.

418
00:27:13,048 --> 0.

419
0. --> 00:27:15,719
And now I want to talk about
Now I want to talk about

420
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:21,699
superconductivity.
Superconductivity was

421
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:27,051
discovered by a Dutch physicist.
His name was Kamerlingh Onnes.

422
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:32,144
And he discovered that if you
cool mercury to something like

423
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:36,719
four degrees Kelvin -- he used
liquid helium for that,

424
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:41,553
in fact he actually discovered
how to make liquid helium.

425
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:46,473
That was the incredible thing.
And then he used the liquid

426
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:51,684
helium to cool down substances,
among them mercury,

427
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:56,342
and he discovered that mercury
would lose completely all its

428
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,499
resistivity.
So the electrical resistance

429
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:03,604
would go down to zero.
And he got the Nobel Prize for

430
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:07,472
that in nineteen thirteen.
You can only understand

431
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:11,971
superconductivity with quantum
mechanics, and even quantum

432
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:16,628
mechanics has a major problem
nowadays to understand all the

433
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,312
phenomenon about
superconductivity.

434
00:28:19,312 --> 00:28:23,97
The problem started in nineteen
eighty-six,

435
00:28:23,97 --> 00:28:27,307
when two scientists in Zurich,
Muller and Bednorz,

436
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:31,529
discovered that certain alloys
can be made superconducting at a

437
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:34,866
temperature as high as
thirty-five degrees Kelvin.

438
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:38,749
And theorists earlier had
proven that it was impossible to

439
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:42,562
ever get superconductivity at
thirty-five degrees Kelvin.

440
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:46,717
And so this was such a splash
in the community that these guys

441
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:49,101
got the Nobel Prize within one
year.

442
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:53,528
In nineteen eighty-seven they
got the Nobel Prize.

443
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:57,202
I don't think there's any other
example that I recall whereby a

444
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,581
discovery was made and within
one year the Nobel Prize was

445
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:02,596
awarded.
And theorists still cannot

446
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:06,271
explain today fully why there is
what's called high-temperature

447
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,346
superconductivity.
The record today,

448
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,309
I checked that yesterday with
Professor Lee at MIT,

449
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:14,391
the record is now hundred
thirty-five degrees Kelvin.

450
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:17,651
So certain alloys can be made
superconducting at hundred

451
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:20,852
thirty-five degrees Kelvin.
And since you probably know

452
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:24,409
that liquid nitrogen has a
temperature of

453
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:28,263
seventy-seven degrees Kelvin,
anyone can now play nowadays

454
00:29:28,263 --> 00:29:32,253
with superconducting subjects,
materials, even high schools,

455
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:35,431
because liquid nitrogen is very
easy to come by.

456
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:39,151
If you make power lines out of
superconducting material,

457
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,315
there would be no loss of
energy.

458
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:45,372
People are thinking about that.
You can imagine how costly it

459
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:49,497
might be, but in principle you
could transport electric energy

460
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,338
without any loss,
without any omega losses.

461
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:54,569
No I squared R,
because R is zero.

462
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:58,288
Also, if you have zero
resistance in

463
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:02,736
a material, you can run
extremely high current through

464
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:07,519
it, and you can therefore get
very strong magnetic fields.

465
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,798
Using superconducting coils,
you can get very strong

466
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:15,407
magnetic fields,
and these colliders that we

467
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:19,435
talked about earlier,
these atom-smashers like we

468
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:24,469
have at Fermilab and in Geneva,
they are going to make use of

469
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:29,336
superconducting coils to get
magnetic fields as high as six

470
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:32,6
tesla
or so, or even higher.

471
00:30:32,6 --> 00:30:35,987
No electric field can exist in
a superconductor.

472
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:40,095
And you can very easily see
that, because if there were an

473
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:44,419
electric field -- if this is a
superconductor and there is an

474
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,157
electric field,
say, in this direction,

475
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:50,4
there would be a potential
difference over the

476
00:30:50,4 --> 00:30:52,49
superconductor.
And Ohm's Law,

477
00:30:52,49 --> 00:30:55,661
V equals I R,
tells you then immediately that

478
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:59,769
if this is not zero but if this
is zero that I would go to

479
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:04,02
infinity.
So you cannot have any electric

480
00:31:04,02 --> 00:31:09,372
field in a superconductor.
If I approach a superconducting

481
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:14,911
disk or material with a magnet
-- say this is the north pole

482
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:20,074
and this is the south pole,
so we have an electric field

483
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:25,331
configur- a magnetic field
configuration roughly like so.

484
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:29,368
If I approach this
superconducting material,

485
00:31:29,368 --> 00:31:34,532
then the EMF generated in here
because of Faraday's Law,

486
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:41,027
because there's a change in the
magnetic flux coming off,

487
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:45,946
that EMF must remain zero,
because you cannot have an

488
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:49,54
electric field inside a
superconductor.

489
00:31:49,54 --> 00:31:52,094
And this, of course,
is I R.

490
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:56,445
So R is also zero.
So I now can have any value,

491
00:31:56,445 --> 00:32:01,363
completely legitimate.
So you can have a huge current

492
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:04,863
inside the superconductor,
but no EMF.

493
00:32:04,863 --> 00:32:09,213
And so as you approach with
this

494
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:15,165
magnet, eddy currents are going
to run inside the superconductor

495
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:20,172
in such a way that D phi D T,
the flux change in here,

496
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:24,518
is always zero.
And so these eddy currents will

497
00:32:24,518 --> 00:32:29,997
flow to never allow any magnetic
flux, because there was no

498
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:35,193
magnetic flux to start with when
the magnet was high up,

499
00:32:35,193 --> 00:32:38,216
so there can never be any
change.

500
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:42,846
And so the eddy c- currents
create a

501
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:46,594
magnetic field themselves
which, if you vectorially add

502
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:50,342
them to this magnetic field,
will always make sure that

503
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:54,228
there is no net magnetic field
inside the superconductor.

504
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:56,935
And so if you now make a
drawing of the,

505
00:32:56,935 --> 00:33:00,336
of the two fields,
the one that is produced by the

506
00:33:00,336 --> 00:33:04,223
eddy currents and the one that
is produced by the magnet,

507
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:08,04
when the magnet comes very
close -- so here is north and

508
00:33:08,04 --> 00:33:11,164
here is south,
and here is your superconductor

509
00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:14,921
--
then the superposition of those

510
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:18,461
two fields then,
effectively comes down to the

511
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:23,418
effect that this magnetic field
is completely repelled -- that's

512
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:28,059
another way of looking at it.
You get a squeezed field here.

513
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:32,15
But that is the superposition
of two magnetic fields,

514
00:33:32,15 --> 00:33:36,084
one produced by the eddy
currents and one from the,

515
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:39,388
the magnet.
And whenever you have here such

516
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:44,738
a squeezed magnetic field,
there is magnetic pressure.

517
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:48,9
We know why there is magnetic
pressure, because north and

518
00:33:48,9 --> 00:33:53,286
north poles repel each other,
but we never expressed that in

519
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:56,631
terms of a quantity.
And the magnetic pressure

520
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:59,902
equals B squared,
which is the magnetic field

521
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:02,355
strength, divided by -- is it
two?

522
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:05,403
Yeah, two mu zero,
divided by two mu zero.

523
00:34:05,403 --> 00:34:09,194
I'll get back to this a little
later in the lecture.

524
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:12,614
And this is pressure,
so this is in newtons per

525
00:34:12,614 --> 00:34:14,808
square
meter.

526
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:18,601
This is not entirely new,
this idea of pressure,

527
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:23,445
because you may have seen at
people's desks nice conversation

528
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:25,22
piece.
You have here a,

529
00:34:25,22 --> 00:34:29,337
a magnet, and you have here a
magnet, and this is a,

530
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:32,646
a wooden stick.
There's a hole in here and

531
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:36,036
there's a hole in here.
This is north pole,

532
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:40,395
south pole, north pole,
south pole, and they repel each

533
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,897
other.
That's magnetic pressure.

534
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:48,429
It's the same thing.
And if you drew the magnetic

535
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:51,861
field configurations here,
go like this,

536
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:57,053
that's the magnetic field from
this magnet and this would be

537
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,133
the magnetic field from that
magnet.

538
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:04,181
We get the same idea.
You get magnetic pressure

539
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:07,261
there.
If I rotate this magnet here,

540
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:11,045
so th- first of all,
the magnet is repelled,

541
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:16,59
which is in a way a form of
levitation, and we're

542
00:35:16,59 --> 00:35:20,291
going to show you that.
The magnet is just pushed up by

543
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,581
the superconductor is the way
you can look at it.

544
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,46
But if you start rotating it,
for instance,

545
00:35:26,46 --> 00:35:30,641
around with the south pole here
or the south pole there or the

546
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:33,314
north pole there,
the eddy currents will

547
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:36,741
instantaneously adjust to always
repel that magnet.

548
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:40,237
So even if you rotate it,
it would still hang there,

549
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:43,115
levitated, rotating.
What is not so easy to

550
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:46,543
understand is why the whole
thing

551
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:51,478
is so very stable.
As you will shortly see,

552
00:35:51,478 --> 00:35:57,119
it's quite stable.
So I'm going to show you there

553
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,818
this superconducting idea.
I first have to top it off with

554
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:09,929
some liquid nitrogen,
so let me do that when we still

555
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:12,749
have full lights.
Oh boy.

556
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:16,157
Good.
So I have to top it off.

557
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:21,249
And this disk,
which is about an inch in

558
00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:24,088
diameter, going to be
superconducting.

559
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:27,695
I can even tell you what kind
of material it is.

560
00:36:27,695 --> 00:36:31,532
It is a copper oxide mixed with
yttrium and barium,

561
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:35,753
and it becomes superconducting
at ninety degrees Kelvin.

562
00:36:35,753 --> 00:36:39,13
And liquid nitrogen is
seventy-seven degrees.

563
00:36:39,13 --> 00:36:42,43
So we're going to put a small
magnet on top,

564
00:36:42,43 --> 00:36:46,42
which we will levitate.
For that, we're going to have

565
00:36:46,42 --> 00:36:52,197
the following light situation.
And of course you want to see

566
00:36:52,197 --> 00:36:55,605
it also, don't you.
And you want some lights.

567
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:59,245
So there you see the disk,
which is -- should be

568
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:02,653
superconducting now.
And here comes my little

569
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,364
magnet.
So there is no magnetic flux

570
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:08,927
going through there.
It itself is not a magnet.

571
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,413
But now I'm going to come close
with a magnet,

572
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:17,06
and the eddy currents go nuts
in there, and it just floats on

573
00:37:17,06 --> 00:37:18,377
top.
It's amazing,

574
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:22,947
isn't it.
So this is magnetic levitation,

575
00:37:22,947 --> 00:37:30,914
and you can rotate it around,
and the eddy currents adjust

576
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:35,387
instantaneously.
And there it is.

577
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:40,419
Now you've all seen it,
clear enough.

578
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:45,731
OK, let me get the -- rescue my
magnet.

579
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:52,86
Imagine in the days of
Kamerlingh Onnes it took four

580
00:37:52,86 --> 00:38:00,339
degrees Kelvin to
have anything superconductive,

581
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:04,737
and now you can do it as easy
as that.

582
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:09,966
There are other forms of
magnetic levitation.

583
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:15,315
One going to be very promising
in our economy,

584
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:21,851
we hope, and that is magnetic
levitation can be used for

585
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:26,011
trains.
If you have a magnet and you

586
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:30,82
move it
fast over a conducting surface,

587
00:38:30,82 --> 00:38:35,428
then you also get levitation.
You have to move it though,

588
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:38,637
whereas there you don't have to
move it.

589
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:43,245
See, if you let that magnet
just go, if you don't move it

590
00:38:43,245 --> 00:38:47,113
anymore, then there is an eddy
current going on,

591
00:38:47,113 --> 00:38:50,898
but the eddy current never
dissipates any heat.

592
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:54,271
There is no I squared R because
R is zero.

593
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:57,069
So you never lose the eddy
current.

594
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:01,58
That's different with
what is coming now.

595
00:39:01,58 --> 00:39:03,278
Now I have a,
a magnet.

596
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:05,671
Here is north and here is
south.

597
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:09,144
So we have a magnetic field
sort of like this.

598
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:13,93
And I'm going to move it over a
plate, over a conducting plate,

599
00:39:13,93 --> 00:39:18,021
and I'll put the plate here.
And as it comes over this

600
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:21,649
conducting plate,
the magnetic flux through that

601
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,27
plate will change.
Mr.

602
00:39:23,27 --> 00:39:26,28
Faralow s- Mr.
Faraday says -- actually,

603
00:39:26,28 --> 00:39:27,978
it's Mr.
Lenz who says,

604
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:32,039
"I don't
like that." And so they're

605
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,567
going to run an eddy current in
here, and the eddy current will

606
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:40,511
undoubtedly go in this direction
as it comes over here.

607
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:45,04
And this current ring now will
produce a magnetic field in this

608
00:39:45,04 --> 00:39:47,45
direction.
And look what you have.

609
00:39:47,45 --> 00:39:51,614
You have again this is the
north pole of this eddy current

610
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:55,704
and this is the south pole.
North pole repels north pole.

611
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:59,795
And so if this has a high
enough speed so that the change

612
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:02,355
of the
magnetic flux,

613
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:05,693
the D phi D T is high enough,
the train can float.

614
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:08,622
Tens of tons of weight can be
made to float.

615
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:12,641
And the reason why in this case
the train has to keep going,

616
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:16,252
that if the train stops the
eddy current will die out.

617
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:20,475
There's no longer the D phi D T
but there is resistance in this

618
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:23,336
conductor, and so you get only
dissipation.

619
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:26,129
You get I squared R.
You get heat in here.

620
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:29,058
And so then the train will just
plunge down.

621
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:32,465
And that's not the case with
the

622
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:36,763
superconductor because you
don't dissipate any heat in the

623
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:40,307
superconductor because the
superconductor has no

624
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,947
resistance.
So the idea is the same,

625
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:47,321
but you see now why you have to
keep this one going and why

626
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:50,865
there you don't.
And so again you get a squeezed

627
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,505
magnetic field,
like you have there,

628
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:55,918
and so you get magnetic
pressure.

629
00:40:55,918 --> 00:41:00,367
Japan and Germany are really
the leaders in the world in the

630
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:03,384
technology of,
uh, maglevs -- that's what

631
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:06,478
these
trains are called.

632
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:08,977
United States is trying to
catch up.

633
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:13,117
There's an enormous reduction
in friction if you can have a

634
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:16,186
train that is not in contact
with the rails.

635
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:19,969
In fact, speeds have been
recorded up to three hundred

636
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:23,395
forty miles per hour.
Both Germany and Japan have

637
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:26,036
test trains, prototypes,
in operation.

638
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:29,748
United States has made a
commitment to build a maglev

639
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:33,246
train to go from Washington,
DC, back and forth to

640
00:41:33,246 --> 00:41:37,529
Baltimore, should be ready in
the year two

641
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:40,517
thousand seven.
The cost per mile at about

642
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:44,962
thirty million dollars per mile.
Now that make strike as high,

643
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:48,825
but keep in mind that if you
build a four-way highway,

644
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:51,959
that's also thirty million
dollars per mile.

645
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,53
So it's no more expensive than
a four-way highway.

646
00:41:55,53 --> 00:41:59,174
And again, when you visit the
eight oh two website,

647
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:01,797
I made several links to maglev
sites.

648
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:07,045
I advise you to take a look.
Now there is a third form of

649
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:12,044
magnetic levitation whereby we
don't need any speed and we

650
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:15,904
don't need any superconductors
but we use AC,

651
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:20,64
we use alternating current.
And that's also easy to see

652
00:42:20,64 --> 00:42:22,745
now.
Here is such a coil,

653
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:27,57
and we run AC through it.
So at one particular moment in

654
00:42:27,57 --> 00:42:31,517
time, let's say the magnetic
field is like so,

655
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:36,341
and maybe is increasing.
And then of course the magnetic

656
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:40,269
field turns around,
up, down, up,

657
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:43,905
down, because it's AC.
Now I have here a conducting

658
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:46,669
plate, and I put this above this
plate.

659
00:42:46,669 --> 00:42:50,451
But now I have this continuous
magnetic field change,

660
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:54,814
so I have a continuous change
of magnetic flux in that plate.

661
00:42:54,814 --> 00:42:58,232
So as this magnetic flux,
as the B field down is

662
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:02,741
increasing, you're going to get
an eddy current running in this

663
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:06,668
direction, which will create the
magnetic field in that

664
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:10,887
direction.
And you're back where you were.

665
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:14,029
You again have north pole,
north pole, south pole,

666
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:16,593
south pole.
So again, the eddy current in

667
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:19,735
the conducting plate is
responsible for a magnetic

668
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:21,98
field, and the two repel each
other.

669
00:43:21,98 --> 00:43:25,378
So a little later in time,
the magnetic field strength

670
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:27,43
will decrease.
When that happens,

671
00:43:27,43 --> 00:43:31,021
the eddy current will reverse
direction, and the two will

672
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:34,035
attract each other.
And so you will think now it

673
00:43:34,035 --> 00:43:38,075
seems quite reasonable that half
the time they will attract each

674
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:42,256
other and the
other half of the time they

675
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:45,096
will repel each other.
That, however,

676
00:43:45,096 --> 00:43:48,646
is not the case.
There will be a net repelling

677
00:43:48,646 --> 00:43:50,382
force.
And why that is,

678
00:43:50,382 --> 00:43:53,932
I will explain to you during
the next lecture.

679
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:56,456
But I want to demonstrate it
now.

680
00:43:56,456 --> 00:44:00,401
I have here such a coil,
about an area of about one

681
00:44:00,401 --> 00:44:03,556
square foot.
I can simply run hundred ten

682
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:07,343
volts, sixty hertz AC.
I switch th- turn this on.

683
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:11,84
This goes into hundred ten volt
outlet, and I increase the

684
00:44:11,84 --> 00:44:15,68
current.
It starts to float.

685
00:44:15,68 --> 00:44:19,457
No high-speed train,
nothing superconducting.

686
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:23,663
What do you think will happen
when I turn it over?

687
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:27,097
Excuse me?
Of course it will float again.

688
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:31,905
The ed- the eddy currents
adjust themselves at any moment

689
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:35,596
in time, and they will always
make it float.

690
00:44:35,596 --> 00:44:40,575
So this is another interesting
form of magnetic levitation.

691
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:45,211
So we have the superconducting
way, whereby there is no

692
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:49,745
dissipation in
the disk, so those currents

693
00:44:49,745 --> 00:44:52,864
never die out.
Then you have the case of the

694
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:56,927
train, if I call that the train,
the magnetic levitation,

695
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,916
whereby you have to keep the
speed going, because if you

696
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:05,269
don't have the speed then you
don't have enough magnetic flux

697
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:09,114
changes in the surface,
and so you don't have the eddy

698
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:11,798
currents.
The eddy currents would die,

699
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:15,57
you get heat dissipation.
And then there is the third

700
00:45:15,57 --> 00:45:19,759
case
here, whereby you simply have a

701
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:23,558
changing magnetic field in the
coil with AC,

702
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:27,534
which then creates the changing
eddy currents.

703
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:31,333
So now we come to the
levitation of a woman.

704
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:36,103
How do we levitate a woman?
Well, the secret must be in

705
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:39,902
that equation.
V is B squared divided by two

706
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:43,171
mu zero.
We have a coil which is about

707
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:46,97
one square foot,
so the area of that coil is

708
00:45:46,97 --> 00:45:51,425
about oh
point one square meters.

709
00:45:51,425 --> 00:45:56,287
And so our goal was that we
should be able to lift,

710
00:45:56,287 --> 00:46:01,344
let's say, a two hundred
pounder, to give ourselves a

711
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:06,11
little bit of leeway.
And so we calculated that if

712
00:46:06,11 --> 00:46:10,584
the magnetic field,
B, is about fifteen hundred

713
00:46:10,584 --> 00:46:14,96
gauss, which is about oh point
one five tesla,

714
00:46:14,96 --> 00:46:22,059
that we would get very close.
We know that mu zero is four pi

715
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:25,882
times ten to the minus seven in
SI units.

716
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:31,521
And so you can calculate now
what the force is on this area.

717
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:36,299
The force is of course the
pressure times the area,

718
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:40,408
assuming that the magnetic
field is uniform.

719
00:46:40,408 --> 00:46:45,951
And so you're going to get that
this force is going to be B

720
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:50,06
squared, which is oh point one
five squared,

721
00:46:50,06 --> 00:46:54,456
divide by two,
divide by four pi,

722
00:46:54,456 --> 00:46:59,541
times ten to the seventh,
multiplied by the area,

723
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:05,897
which is oh point one square
meter, and you find that this is

724
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:10,558
about nine hundred newtons.
Ninety kilograms,

725
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:13,947
as I said, a two hundred
pounder.

726
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:18,185
Then we tried to get this
magnetic field,

727
00:47:18,185 --> 00:47:22,104
and believe me,
Marcos and I and Bill,

728
00:47:22,104 --> 00:47:26,357
we really
tried, but there was a problem,

729
00:47:26,357 --> 00:47:29,706
because we needed enormously
high currents to get these

730
00:47:29,706 --> 00:47:32,063
magnetic fields.
And at these very high

731
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:35,164
currents, our circuit breakers
would go every time.

732
00:47:35,164 --> 00:47:38,203
So we called up the physical
plant, and they said,

733
00:47:38,203 --> 00:47:40,064
"Yeah, what do you expect,
man?

734
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:42,049
You need several hundred
amperes.

735
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:45,274
You think we can get seven
hundred -- several hundred

736
00:47:45,274 --> 00:47:48,685
amperes out of this system?
You have to redesign MIT for

737
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:51,29
that." So it was very
disappointing for us.

738
00:47:51,29 --> 00:47:56,438
So the best we could do was the
strongest current that we could

739
00:47:56,438 --> 00:48:00,623
generate, we could only get a
magnetic field of about three

740
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:04,232
hundred and fifty gauss,
which is four times lower.

741
00:48:04,232 --> 00:48:08,562
And the tragedy has it that the
magnetic pressure goes with B

742
00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:11,81
squared, so that makes it
sixteen times lower.

743
00:48:11,81 --> 00:48:15,779
So the two hundred pounder now
becomes a twelve pounder.

744
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:20,037
But that's the reason why when
some women wrote me very nice

745
00:48:20,037 --> 00:48:24,223
email yesterday because they
volunteered, why I had to say,

746
00:48:24,223 --> 00:48:33,43
"Thanks, but no
thanks." But I want to keep my

747
00:48:33,43 --> 00:48:42,349
promise.
I said I was going to levitate

748
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:50,798
a woman, and I will.
And here she is.

749
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:58,543
[laughter].
And as far as we know,

750
00:48:58,543 --> 00:49:02,998
it
is a woman.

751
00:49:02,998 --> 00:49:09,51
[laughter].
OK, give her some room.

752
00:49:09,51 --> 00:49:15,831
She deserves -- we ready for
that?

753
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:23,302
And there she goes.
I levitated a woman.

754
00:49:23,302 --> 00:49:30,773
[laughter].
Have a great Spring

755
00:49:30,773 --> 49:36
Break. [applause].
