1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
You have ten days left for your
motor, so that's a nice project

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:10
for Spring Break.
I'll give you some hints.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13
Keep the friction of your rotor
as low as you can.

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
You can't use any oil,
of course; that's not allowed.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
Balance your rotor to the best
you can.

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
And try to avoid that the rotor
begins to bounce,

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
begins to vibrate,
because when it vibrates it

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:30
loses contact with the current
when it needs it so there's no

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:34
torque.
How will we test your motors?

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:38
We do it with a stroboscope,
and I've decided to demonstrate

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:44
to you how we're going to do
that.

12
00:00:41 --> 00:00:47
That's probably the best thing
to do.

13
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
We here have a disk,
and we're going to rotate the

14
00:00:49 --> 00:00:55
disk at 1000 RPM.
Let's assume that is your

15
00:00:53 --> 00:00:59
motor.
And we're going to strobe it

16
00:00:56 --> 00:01:02
with a strobe light until it
stands still.

17
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
In this case,
I have set the strobe so that

18
00:01:05 --> 00:01:11
it will stand still,
roughly, and the strobe is now

19
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
going at 500 RPM,
and the motor is going at

20
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
1000 RPM.
So this clearly is not the

21
00:01:18 --> 00:01:24
rotation rate of your motor.
In fact, your motor goes twice

22
00:01:23 --> 00:01:29
around between the blinks.
And we'd have no way of knowing

23
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34
that, so we double the
frequency.

24
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
I'm trying to double it now,
double the frequency of the

25
00:01:37 --> 00:01:43
blinking of the strobe light.
And now it stands still again.

26
00:01:42 --> 00:01:48
So now we may think that your
motor is going 1000 RPM,

27
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
but we don't know yet.
Maybe it's going 

28
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
R- 2000 RPM.
Maybe 3000 RPM.

29
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
So what are we going to do now,
we're going to double the

30
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
frequency.
And so we go now with the

31
00:02:03 --> 00:02:09
strobe light to 
RPM.

32
00:02:06 --> 00:02:12
And what we see now is
we see a double image.

33
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
So 2000 RPM is out,
and any multiple of 

34
00:02:14 --> 00:02:20
2000 RPM is out.
So 4000 RPM is out,

35
00:02:16 --> 00:02:22
6000,
and 8000 is out.

36
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
But what is not yet out is
3000 and 

37
00:02:22 --> 00:02:28
and 7000.
So we would have to test for

38
00:02:25 --> 00:02:31
that.
On the other hand,

39
00:02:26 --> 00:02:32
I told you already that this
motor is going 1000 RPM,

40
00:02:30 --> 00:02:36
so there's no sense us testing
that now.

41
00:02:32 --> 00:02:38
But during the actual contest,
of course, we will continue all

42
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
the way until we are convinced
that we have the right RPM for

43
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
your motor.
And so that's the way we will

44
00:02:44 --> 00:02:50
do it.
We will put a little bit of

45
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
white paint on one side of your
rotor, so that's the way it will

46
00:02:52 --> 00:02:58
be done.
Of course, if your motor is

47
00:02:55 --> 00:03:01
highly unstable in terms of
rotation rate,

48
00:02:58 --> 00:03:04
it will not be easy to get a
right correct number.

49
00:03:03 --> 00:03:09
I want to talk with you about
the heart.

50
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
The heart, our heart has four
chambers.

51
00:03:09 --> 00:03:15
Looks sort of like this.
The left atrium and right

52
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
atrium.
Maybe this is why it's -- this

53
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
is why it's called the heart.
And here is the left and the

54
00:03:24 --> 00:03:30
ri- and the right ventricle.
And here is the aorta.

55
00:03:29 --> 00:03:35
The sole purpose of the heart
is to pump blood.

56
00:03:34 --> 00:03:40
About 5 quarts per minute,
which is 75 gallons

57
00:03:40 --> 00:03:46
per hour, which is 70
barrels per day,

58
00:03:44 --> 00:03:50
which is about 2 million
barrels in 75 years.

59
00:03:50 --> 00:03:56
And it pumps about 70
times per minute.

60
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
If the blood to your brain
stops for about 5 seconds,

61
00:03:58 --> 00:04:04
you lose consciousness.
So it's five skips of the

62
00:04:02 --> 00:04:08
heartbeat, and you're down on
the floor.

63
00:04:05 --> 00:04:11
And four minutes later,
permanent brain damage.

64
00:04:09 --> 00:04:15
The way the heart works is
absolutely mind-boggling.

65
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
Extremely complicated.
Nature had one billion years to

66
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
design it, but nevertheless
it's impressive.

67
00:04:22 --> 00:04:28
Each heart cell is a mini
chemical battery,

68
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
and it pumps ions in or out as
it pleases.

69
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
In the normal state,
each heart cell is minus 80

70
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
millivolts on the inside
relative to the outside.

71
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
There are some cells which are
called pacemaker cells.

72
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
They are located in a very
small

73
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
area, about 1 square
millimeter, near the atrium,

74
00:04:52 --> 00:04:58
the right atrium,
and they change their potential

75
00:04:56 --> 00:05:02
from minus 80 millivolts to
plus 20 millivolts.

76
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
Now why they do that is a
different story,

77
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
which I will not address.
Once they go to plus 20

78
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
millivolts, the neighboring
cells follow,

79
00:05:10 --> 00:05:16
and a wave propagates over the
heart.

80
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
I'll make you a drawing
shortly.

81
00:05:15 --> 00:05:21
So the wave first moves over
the atrial chambers and then

82
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
over the
ventricle chambers.

83
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
And when the cells are at plus
20 millivolts inside

84
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
relative to the outside,
they contract.

85
00:05:31 --> 00:05:37
So they form a muscle.
The whole heart is one big

86
00:05:35 --> 00:05:41
muscle.
And after about 2/10 of a

87
00:05:38 --> 00:05:44
second, the cells return to
minus 80 millivolts,

88
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
and this wave goes from below
to above.

89
00:05:46 --> 00:05:52
And then the whole thing waits
again for another message from

90
00:05:51 --> 00:05:57
the pacemaker cells.
Takes about one second,

91
00:05:57 --> 00:06:03
and then the whole process
starts all over.

92
00:06:01 --> 00:06:07
Now I want to be more precise.
Here is one heart cell.

93
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
So this is about 10 microns in
size.

94
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
And this cell has 80
millivolts with respect to the

95
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
outside.
So that means it has repelled

96
00:06:21 --> 00:06:27
positive ions,
and so the inside is negative.

97
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
And there is no E field here
outside, because if you put a

98
00:06:31 --> 00:06:37
Gaussian surface around here,
there is no net charge inside.

99
00:06:36 --> 00:06:42
But there is,
of course, a electric field

100
00:06:39 --> 00:06:45
across the walls here,
from plus to minus.

101
00:06:42 --> 00:06:48
Now the depolarization,
which is the change to the plus

102
00:06:46 --> 00:06:52
20 millivolt state starts,
and it starts from above.

103
00:06:51 --> 00:06:57
And I will assume now that it
is not plus 20 but 0

104
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
millivolts, and it's easier to
see.

105
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
If we have this cell,
and the wave is,

106
00:07:02 --> 00:07:08
say, halfway down,
and this is now 0

107
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
millivolts, then there is no
longer minus charge here and no

108
00:07:09 --> 00:07:15
longer plus charge here,
because 0 millivolts

109
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
relative to the outside world.
So there is no electric field

110
00:07:17 --> 00:07:23
across here anymore.

111
00:07:20 --> 00:07:26
In other words,
what the cell has done,

112
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
it has moved positive ions back
in.

113
00:07:26 --> 00:07:32
But here the situation is still
as it was before,

114
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
so this is still at your minus
80 millivolts.

115
00:07:35 --> 00:07:41
And if you look now,
you have here a minus layer on

116
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
top of a positive layer.
Positive here,

117
00:07:44 --> 00:07:50
minus on top.
And that creates an electric

118
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
field, which has roughly the
shape of a electric dipole.

119
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
It has this shape.
So as the wave goes through the

120
00:07:58 --> 00:08:04
cells, only then do they
create a dipole.

121
00:08:02 --> 00:08:08
And we call this the
depolarization.

122
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
A little later in time,
when this wave has passed,

123
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
the whole thing is plus 20
millivolts.

124
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
I chose 0 here,
but it really goes to plus

125
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
20.
This is just easier to explain.

126
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
So that means that now the
inside is plus,

127
00:08:23 --> 00:08:29
so positive ions are now
inside, negative ions are

128
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
outside, and the E field here is
again 0.

129
00:08:31 --> 00:08:37
Now there is the repolarization
wave,

130
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
which comes from below,
when it goes back to minus

131
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
80 millivolts.
And I will again do the same

132
00:08:44 --> 00:08:50
trick that I did before;
I will just assume the wave is

133
00:08:48 --> 00:08:54
halfway, that it is not minus
80 but that it is 0

134
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
millivolts.
So there are no charges here,

135
00:08:56 --> 00:09:02
but the charges here are
unchanged.

136
00:08:59 --> 00:09:05
So what do you have now here?
You have a minus layer on top

137
00:09:03 --> 00:09:09
of a plus layer.
So you have exactly what

138
00:09:08 --> 00:09:14
you had before.
So again you get an electric

139
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
field, which is an electric
dipole field,

140
00:09:16 --> 00:09:22
which has again the same shape.
So what's going to happen is

141
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
the depolarization wave is going
to run down, leaves behind here

142
00:09:28 --> 00:09:34
the cells at plus 20
millivolts, when they are

143
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
contracted, so this part of the
heart has already pumped,

144
00:09:38 --> 00:09:44
and it moves down.
And only the cells where the

145
00:09:43 --> 00:09:49
depolarization occurs,
that's only the ones on the

146
00:09:47 --> 00:09:53
ring, contribute to that
electric dipole field.

147
00:09:51 --> 00:09:57
If there is no wave,
which is a sizeable fraction of

148
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
the heart, of the cycle,
there is no wave,

149
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
then there is no electric
dipole field.

150
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
And when the repolarization
goes in the other direction,

151
00:10:04 --> 00:10:10
when the heart relaxes because
the cells go back to minus

152
00:10:09 --> 00:10:15
80 millivolts,
then again there is an electric

153
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
dipole field,
but only from the cells through

154
00:10:18 --> 00:10:24
which the repolarization wave
moves.

155
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
And you can very easily see
that the electric dipole fields

156
00:10:26 --> 00:10:32
of all these cells here support
each other.

157
00:10:30 --> 00:10:36
So you get a dipole field from
the heart.

158
00:10:34 --> 00:10:40
And so if I make you look at
your heart -- so this is you,

159
00:10:39 --> 00:10:45
this is your body,
your legs, and this is your

160
00:10:44 --> 00:10:50
arms, and here is
your heart, and there goes this

161
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
wave.
And so here is your electric

162
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
field that is generated while
the wave is going,

163
00:10:56 --> 00:11:02
either depolarization down or
repolarization up.

164
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
But if there is an electric
field, there's going to be a

165
00:11:05 --> 00:11:11
potential difference between
different parts of your body.

166
00:11:10 --> 00:11:16
You look here at your belly
button, and you follow this

167
00:11:15 --> 00:11:21
electric field
line at your head,

168
00:11:18 --> 00:11:24
there is an E field.
The integral E dot dL gives

169
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
you a potential difference.
And so now you see that

170
00:11:25 --> 00:11:31
there're going to be potential
differences between the various

171
00:11:29 --> 00:11:35
parts of your body.
And that's the idea behind an

172
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
electrocardiogram.
Typically there are 12

173
00:11:36 --> 00:11:42
electrodes attached to arms,
legs, head, and chest to get as

174
00:11:40 --> 00:11:46
much information about the heart
as we can.

175
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
And the maximum potential
difference between two

176
00:11:46 --> 00:11:52
electrodes, in general,
is not more than about

177
00:11:50 --> 00:11:56
2 to 3 millivolts.
I'd like to show you a healthy

178
00:11:58 --> 00:12:04
heart cardiogram,
of a healthy person.

179
00:12:04 --> 00:12:10
I have that here.
The time here is about 1

180
00:12:10 --> 00:12:16
second, and from here to here is
about 1 millivolt.

181
00:12:18 --> 00:12:24
The P wave --
we call this the P wave -- that

182
00:12:23 --> 00:12:29
is observed when the atrium is
being depolarized,

183
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
so when the depolarization wave
goes over the atrium.

184
00:12:30 --> 00:12:36
A little later it goes over the
ventricle, and you get a larger

185
00:12:35 --> 00:12:41
potential difference because
there is more muscle in the

186
00:12:39 --> 00:12:45
ventricle.
So that's why this R wave is

187
00:12:41 --> 00:12:47
higher.
The T wave is the

188
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
repolarization,
when the wave goes back over

189
00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
the ventricles.
The dipole field is in the same

190
00:12:49 --> 00:12:55
direction, remember.
That's the T wave.

191
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
It's not known,
at least it wasn't known

192
00:12:56 --> 00:13:02
recent- until recently,
what causes the U wave.

193
00:12:59 --> 00:13:05
I talked to a heart expert
about this, Professor Cohen at

194
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
MIT, and I was surprised to
learn that it's not known what

195
00:13:07 --> 00:13:13
the U wave is about.
Not everyone's cardiogram looks

196
00:13:10 --> 00:13:16
as healthy as this one.
There is a terrible disease,

197
00:13:14 --> 00:13:20
which 4000 
people die of per year in the

198
00:13:18 --> 00:13:24
United States,
which is known as ventricular

199
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
fibrillation,
also known as sudden death.

200
00:13:25 --> 00:13:31
The ventricles fire without any
message from the pace wave,

201
00:13:30 --> 00:13:36
pacemaker wave,
and there is random,

202
00:13:33 --> 00:13:39
non-synchronous depolarization.
So the heart doesn't pump

203
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
anymore, in 5 seconds you
lose consciousness,

204
00:13:41 --> 00:13:47
on the floor,
and in four minutes you,

205
00:13:44 --> 00:13:50
um, have permanent brain
damage.

206
00:13:47 --> 00:13:53
In hospitals,
heart patients are being

207
00:13:50 --> 00:13:56
monitored,
and as soon as it's noticed

208
00:13:54 --> 00:14:00
that there is something wrong
like this, so severe as the

209
00:13:57 --> 00:14:03
fibrillation,
ventricular fibrillation,

210
00:14:00 --> 00:14:06
then they apply electric shock
treatment.

211
00:14:02 --> 00:14:08
So you have to be fast,
you only have a few minutes

212
00:14:06 --> 00:14:12
before you get brain damage.
And 3000 volts is

213
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
applied, 1 amperes,
for about a tenth of a second.

214
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
Large plates are being used on
each side of the chest.

215
00:14:16 --> 00:14:22
And this, of course,
is enough to kill the patient.

216
00:14:19 --> 00:14:25
But it makes little difference,
because the patient would have

217
00:14:23 --> 00:14:29
died
anyhow.

218
00:14:26 --> 00:14:32
Heart patients can also get
synchronization problems and

219
00:14:30 --> 00:14:36
then they implant a pacemaker,
that's a circuit.

220
00:14:35 --> 00:14:41
And this pacemaker takes over
the role from the pacemaker

221
00:14:40 --> 00:14:46
cells.
When the heartbeat rate falls

222
00:14:43 --> 00:14:49
below a certain rate,
the artificial pacemaker takes

223
00:14:47 --> 00:14:53
over.
About 10 milliamperes for half

224
00:14:50 --> 00:14:56
a millisecond,
and it does it 60 times per

225
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00
minute.
And so it triggers,

226
00:14:58 --> 00:15:04
then, the depolarization wave.
These pacemakers are

227
00:15:02 --> 00:15:08
susceptible to influences from
the outside world,

228
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
and one person's pacemaker
stopped, for instance,

229
00:15:10 --> 00:15:16
every 10 seconds due to a
radar sweep from a police car.

230
00:15:14 --> 00:15:20
It's also possible that you get
a built-in defibrillator,

231
00:15:19 --> 00:15:25
in other words,
a system that gives you

232
00:15:22 --> 00:15:28
electric shocks when sudden
death might otherwise occur.

233
00:15:28 --> 00:15:34
So it senses that something is
wrong, that the ventricle is

234
00:15:32 --> 00:15:38
going into fibrillation,
and then it applies,

235
00:15:35 --> 00:15:41
all by itself,
650 volts,

236
00:15:38 --> 00:15:44
about 5.5
milliseconds,

237
00:15:40 --> 00:15:46
up to 5 to 10 amperes.
And that's not enough to kill

238
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
the patient, and the whole idea
is sort of a wake-up call to the

239
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
heart to get it back into
synchronization,

240
00:15:51 --> 00:15:57
to get this depolarization wave
being synchronized again.

241
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01
So clearly I would like to show
now a heart cardiogram of a

242
00:15:59 --> 00:16:05
student,
and I prefer to have a healthy

243
00:16:03 --> 00:16:09
one to avoid some difficulties.
You feel strong?

244
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
You a healthy person?
You don't mind volunteering?

245
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
Tight pants,
we have to do something about.

246
00:16:13 --> 00:16:19
OK, why don't you sit down.
[laughter].

247
00:16:16 --> 00:16:22
Well, there's nothing I -- come
in.

248
00:16:18 --> 00:16:24
We'll, we'll,
we will, we'll,

249
00:16:20 --> 00:16:26
we'll find a way.
All right, so we have to attach

250
00:16:24 --> 00:16:30
-- we don't have twelve
electrodes, we only use three.

251
00:16:28 --> 00:16:34
And the first one -- that's why
I was worried about your

252
00:16:33 --> 00:16:39
tight pants.
Can you roll them up a little?

253
00:16:36 --> 00:16:42
OK.
Oh, this one goes here.

254
00:16:39 --> 00:16:45
Let's hope that it makes good
contact.

255
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
Now the others go on your arm,
and we need very good

256
00:16:46 --> 00:16:52
electrical contact,
and therefore we put some

257
00:16:50 --> 00:16:56
conducting grease on there.
It will make it a little -- it

258
00:16:54 --> 00:17:00
will make it a bit of a mess,
but we'll give you a chance

259
00:16:59 --> 00:17:05
later to clean up.
So let's first put this one --

260
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
you're relaxed,
right?

261
00:17:07 --> 00:17:13
Yes, of course.
So can you roll up your sleeve

262
00:17:11 --> 00:17:17
there?
Very good.

263
00:17:12 --> 00:17:18
And mayb- oh,
oh, and maybe you can put this

264
00:17:16 --> 00:17:22
over your arm,
yeah, over your -- yeah,

265
00:17:20 --> 00:17:26
that's good.
High up.

266
00:17:22 --> 00:17:28
Oh man, boy,
you have muscles.

267
00:17:25 --> 00:17:31
[laughter].
All right, just relax.

268
00:17:28 --> 00:17:34
If it hurts a little,
oh well, that's the way it is.

269
00:17:33 --> 00:17:39
[laughter].
We need, we ne- we need good

270
00:17:38 --> 00:17:44
contact.
OK, now your other arm.

271
00:17:41 --> 00:17:47
Again, a little bit of gooky
stuff.

272
00:17:45 --> 00:17:51
Oh, you need another rubber
band, so put it around your arm

273
00:17:50 --> 00:17:56
high up.
That's good,

274
00:17:52 --> 00:17:58
yeah.
All right.

275
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
So now it's very important that
you relax, because when you

276
00:17:59 --> 00:18:05
start moving,
the other muscle cells will

277
00:18:03 --> 00:18:09
also produce electric dipole
fields.

278
00:18:08 --> 00:18:14
And that we don't want,
because then that will be

279
00:18:14 --> 00:18:20
overpowering.
All right.

280
00:18:16 --> 00:18:22
I'm going to take -- make you
take a look at this.

281
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
Yeah?
Everything OK?

282
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
So I'm going to change the
light situation so that you can

283
00:18:31 --> 00:18:37
see shortly there what's coming
up.

284
00:18:35 --> 00:18:41
Oh, man.
What a da- oh gee,

285
00:18:38 --> 00:18:44
look at this.
Oh, gee.

286
00:18:42 --> 00:18:48
Oh, look!
I see your -- I don't see your

287
00:18:45 --> 00:18:51
P wave.
[laughter].

288
00:18:47 --> 00:18:53
But you have an amazing T wave,
right -- no,

289
00:18:50 --> 00:18:56
no, you have an amazing R wave!
It looks like your R wave is in

290
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
the wrong direction.
[laughter].

291
00:18:57 --> 00:19:03
You feel OK though,
right?

292
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
Yeah, I can't see your P wave.
Well, maybe some people survive

293
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
without P waves.
[laughter].

294
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
It's a certainly an unusual,
an unusual heart,

295
00:19:08 --> 00:19:14
but if you tell me that you are
healthy,

296
00:19:13 --> 00:19:19
then I'll take your word for
that.

297
00:19:15 --> 00:19:21
I think it would be nice if you
show class now,

298
00:19:18 --> 00:19:24
why don't you just stand up for
a while, let your other muscles

299
00:19:22 --> 00:19:28
begin to act,
and y- they will see then --

300
00:19:24 --> 00:19:30
just stand up.
You will see -- move a little

301
00:19:27 --> 00:19:33
bit your arms.
Move your arms.

302
00:19:29 --> 00:19:35
You see?
Now you get the electric dipole

303
00:19:31 --> 00:19:37
field from the other muscles in
the body [laughter] which

304
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
contract.
This is even more interesting

305
00:19:37 --> 00:19:43
than your heart,
man.

306
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
[laughter].
All right.

307
00:19:40 --> 00:19:46
Sit down again and let's take
it off.

308
00:19:42 --> 00:19:48
And then you can clean up.
Looks good.

309
00:19:47 --> 00:19:53
Yeah.
Heart cardiograms are not so

310
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
easy to interpret.
But I think you're looking

311
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
fine.
And you feel all right,

312
00:19:58 --> 00:20:04
right?
That's important.

313
00:20:00 --> 00:20:06
So thank you very much for
volunteering,

314
00:20:04 --> 00:20:10
very courageous.
[applause].

315
00:20:07 --> 00:20:13
Yeah, make sure you clean that
stuff off, huh.

316
00:20:12 --> 00:20:18
It's water-soluble,
so it's not so bad.

317
00:20:16 --> 00:20:22
What is your name,
by the way?

318
00:20:19 --> 00:20:25
Danny.
You were great,

319
00:20:23 --> 00:20:29
Danny.
[laughter].

320
00:20:26 --> 00:20:32
.
And now I want to talk about

321
00:20:30 --> 00:20:36
Aurora Borealis.
If we have a magnetic field and

322
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
we have a charged particle,
let's say, make it plus,

323
00:20:45 --> 00:20:51
and the velocity of that
charged particle is in this

324
00:20:52 --> 00:20:58
direction,
then the force on that charged

325
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
particle, the Lorenz force,
equals Q times V cross B.

326
00:21:05 --> 00:21:11
I'm going to decompose this
velocity now into one component

327
00:21:11 --> 00:21:17
parallel to the magnetic field
and into a component

328
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
perpendicular to the magnetic
field, so the vectorial sum of

329
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
these two is V.
And so I can rewrite this as Q

330
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
times V parallel plus V
perpendicular

331
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37
crossed with B.
But V parallel crossed with B

332
00:21:35 --> 00:21:41
is 0, because the angle is
either 0 degrees or

333
00:21:40 --> 00:21:46
degrees,
so the sine of the angle is

334
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
0.
And so the force is exclusively

335
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
determined by this term.
It's by the perpendicular

336
00:21:52 --> 00:21:58
component.
And so what is going to happen,

337
00:21:55 --> 00:22:01
this charged particle is going
to circle around.

338
00:22:01 --> 00:22:07
But then it continues to go in
this direction with that

339
00:22:05 --> 00:22:11
velocity V parallel.
And so you are going to see a

340
00:22:10 --> 00:22:16
path like this.
Well, by this radius R of that

341
00:22:13 --> 00:22:19
circle, that radius i- I still
remember it from the lecture

342
00:22:18 --> 00:22:24
when we discussed that,
that was M V divided by Q B,

343
00:22:23 --> 00:22:29
but the V now is of course the
perpendicular component divided

344
00:22:28 --> 00:22:34
by Q B, and then in this
direction it continues unaltered

345
00:22:32 --> 00:22:38
with the
velocity which is the parallel

346
00:22:37 --> 00:22:43
component.
Magnetic field of the earth,

347
00:22:41 --> 00:22:47
it's not a straight line but is
curved, and so charged particles

348
00:22:48 --> 00:22:54
can spiral around the magnetic
field and follow the magnetic

349
00:22:54 --> 00:23:00
field lines, and they come down
on Earth where the magnetic

350
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
field lines enter,
which is near the magnetic

351
00:23:05 --> 00:23:11
poles.
The sun emits a plasma.

352
00:23:08 --> 00:23:14
Plasma is highly ionized
electrons and protons.

353
00:23:12 --> 00:23:18
We call that the solar wind.
Sometimes it's strong,

354
00:23:16 --> 00:23:22
sometimes it's weak.
And when it reaches the Earth,

355
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
it ionizes the upper atmosphere
of the Earth,

356
00:23:24 --> 00:23:30
and then it produces light.
The light is very faint,

357
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
can only be seen at night.
And that light is called

358
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
Aurora, and we here call it
Northern Lights,

359
00:23:38 --> 00:23:44
but I'm sure that people in the
southern hemisphere,

360
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47
they call it Southern Lights.
When the sun is very active,

361
00:23:45 --> 00:23:51
it can be breathtaking,
really absolutely fabulous.

362
00:23:49 --> 00:23:55
The Aurora can change very
fast, on time scales of seconds

363
00:23:53 --> 00:23:59
to minutes.
And it is, of course,

364
00:23:55 --> 00:24:01
strongest near the magnetic
poles, and so you r- rarely ever

365
00:23:59 --> 00:24:05
see it in Boston.
It can have very bright colors,

366
00:24:03 --> 00:24:09
red, green, white is the most
common.

367
00:24:05 --> 00:24:11
And the color that you will see
depends on the energy of the

368
00:24:11 --> 00:24:17
charged particles as they come
in.

369
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
But it also depends on whether
the nitrogen molecules in the

370
00:24:16 --> 00:24:22
atmosphere or the oxygen
molecules are being excited.

371
00:24:19 --> 00:24:25
Also depends on at what height,
what height in the atmosphere

372
00:24:23 --> 00:24:29
the ionization occurs.
I've seen it quite a few times

373
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
in my life.
I did hiking in the Adirondack

374
00:24:28 --> 00:24:34
where I saw it.
I've seen it from Calgary in

375
00:24:31 --> 00:24:37
Canada.
But whenever I fly to Europe,

376
00:24:33 --> 00:24:39
and flights are always at
night, I always ask for a window

377
00:24:37 --> 00:24:43
seat on the left side of the
plane,

378
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
and that's the reason.
So that I can look to the

379
00:24:45 --> 00:24:51
north, and a few times have I
seen spectacular Aurora from the

380
00:24:50 --> 00:24:56
plane.
I want to show you some slides.

381
00:24:54 --> 00:25:00
If you visit the 8.02
website I made some links for

382
00:25:00 --> 00:25:06
you to some fabulous slides of
Aurora.

383
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
But now I want to show you a
few that I have here.

384
00:25:08 --> 00:25:14
Can I have the first slide?
This is, um,

385
00:25:13 --> 00:25:19
white Aurora,
like a nice curtain.

386
00:25:17 --> 00:25:23
Not so uncommon.
Can change on time scales of

387
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
minutes to seconds.
As I said, you can only see it

388
00:25:26 --> 00:25:32
at night.
It's very faint.

389
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
The next slide?
You see another remarkable

390
00:25:32 --> 00:25:38
example of Aurora,
white Aurora.

391
00:25:35 --> 00:25:41
Strange shapes,
very unpredictable.

392
00:25:38 --> 00:25:44
And the moving,
it's like looking at a movie

393
00:25:42 --> 00:25:48
when you actually see Aurora.
The next one is red Aurora,

394
00:25:49 --> 00:25:55
like a wonderful curtain coming
down.

395
00:25:52 --> 00:25:58
For reasons that are not so
easy to understand,

396
00:25:56 --> 00:26:02
maximum light comes from a ring
which is, which has a radius of

397
00:26:00 --> 00:26:06
about 500 kilometers
from the magnetic pole.

398
00:26:04 --> 00:26:10
And the next slide shows you a
picture taken from a satellite

399
00:26:09 --> 00:26:15
which is three Earth radii away
from the Earth.

400
00:26:12 --> 00:26:18
This is taken in ultraviolet
light.

401
00:26:15 --> 00:26:21
And you see beautiful this,
this ring.

402
00:26:19 --> 00:26:25
So this radius is roughly 500 kilometers,

403
00:26:22 --> 00:26:28
and here is one of the magnetic
poles.

404
00:26:25 --> 00:26:31
I don't know whether it's the
North Pole or the South Magnetic

405
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
Pole.
And the next slide shows you

406
00:26:32 --> 00:26:38
something similar.
If you look only at these four,

407
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
they are taken 12 minutes
apart, again in UV,

408
00:26:39 --> 00:26:45
and you see here a crossbar.
I don't know how to explain

409
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
that crossbar.
It's called Theta Aurora.

410
00:26:46 --> 00:26:52
Obviously why theta goes
without saying,

411
00:26:51 --> 00:26:57
right.
Amazing.

412
00:26:52 --> 00:26:58
And this is sort of -- these
are twelve minutes apart,

413
00:26:58 --> 00:27:04
so that gives you also an idea
how fast this can change.

414
00:27:04 --> 00:27:10
Over here it's very dark and
here it's very bright.

415
00:27:09 --> 00:27:15
So the changes are quite
dramatic.

416
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
.
Now I want to talk about

417
00:27:15 --> 00:27:21
superconductivity.
Superconductivity was

418
00:27:21 --> 00:27:27
discovered by a Dutch physicist.
His name was Kamerlingh Onnes.

419
00:27:27 --> 00:27:33
And he discovered that if you
cool mercury to something like

420
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
4 degrees Kelvin -- he used
liquid helium for that,

421
00:27:36 --> 00:27:42
in fact he actually discovered
how to make liquid helium.

422
00:27:41 --> 00:27:47
That was the incredible thing.
And then he used the liquid

423
00:27:46 --> 00:27:52
helium to cool down substances,
among them mercury,

424
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
and he discovered that mercury
would lose completely all its

425
00:27:56 --> 00:28:02
resistivity.
So the electrical resistance

426
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
would go down to 0.
And he got the Nobel Prize for

427
00:28:03 --> 00:28:09
that in 1913.
You can only understand

428
00:28:07 --> 00:28:13
superconductivity with quantum
mechanics, and even quantum

429
00:28:11 --> 00:28:17
mechanics has a major problem
nowadays to understand all the

430
00:28:16 --> 00:28:22
phenomenon about
superconductivity.

431
00:28:19 --> 00:28:25
The problem started in 1986,

432
00:28:23 --> 00:28:29
when two scientists in Zurich,
Muller and Bednorz,

433
00:28:27 --> 00:28:33
discovered that certain alloys
can be made superconducting at a

434
00:28:31 --> 00:28:37
temperature as high as
35 degrees Kelvin.

435
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
And theorists earlier had
proven that it was impossible to

436
00:28:38 --> 00:28:44
ever get superconductivity at
35 degrees Kelvin.

437
00:28:42 --> 00:28:48
And so this was such a splash
in the community that these guys

438
00:28:46 --> 00:28:52
got the Nobel Prize within one
year.

439
00:28:49 --> 00:28:55
In 1987 they
got the Nobel Prize.

440
00:28:53 --> 00:28:59
I don't think there's any other
example that I recall whereby a

441
00:28:57 --> 00:29:03
discovery was made and within
one year the Nobel Prize was

442
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
awarded.
And theorists still cannot

443
00:29:02 --> 00:29:08
explain today fully why there is
what's called high-temperature

444
00:29:06 --> 00:29:12
superconductivity.
The record today,

445
00:29:08 --> 00:29:14
I checked that yesterday with
Professor Lee at MIT,

446
00:29:11 --> 00:29:17
the record is now 135 degrees Kelvin.

447
00:29:14 --> 00:29:20
So certain alloys can be made
superconducting at

448
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
degrees Kelvin.
And since you probably know

449
00:29:20 --> 00:29:26
that liquid nitrogen has a
temperature of

450
00:29:24 --> 00:29:30
77 degrees Kelvin,
anyone can now play nowadays

451
00:29:28 --> 00:29:34
with superconducting subjects,
materials, even high schools,

452
00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
because liquid nitrogen is very
easy to come by.

453
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
If you make power lines out of
superconducting material,

454
00:29:39 --> 00:29:45
there would be no loss of
energy.

455
00:29:41 --> 00:29:47
People are thinking about that.
You can imagine how costly it

456
00:29:45 --> 00:29:51
might be, but in principle you
could transport electric energy

457
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
without any loss,
without any ohmic losses.

458
00:29:52 --> 00:29:58
No I squared R,
because R is 0.

459
00:29:54 --> 00:30:00
Also, if you have 0
resistance in

460
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
a material, you can run
extremely high current through

461
00:30:02 --> 00:30:08
it, and you can therefore get
very strong magnetic fields.

462
00:30:07 --> 00:30:13
Using superconducting coils,
you can get very strong

463
00:30:11 --> 00:30:17
magnetic fields,
and these colliders that we

464
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
talked about earlier,
these atom-smashers like we

465
00:30:19 --> 00:30:25
have at Fermilab and in Geneva,
they are going to make use of

466
00:30:24 --> 00:30:30
superconducting coils to get
magnetic fields as high as 6

467
00:30:29 --> 00:30:35
tesla
or so, or even higher.

468
00:30:32 --> 00:30:38
No electric field can exist in
a superconductor.

469
00:30:35 --> 00:30:41
And you can very easily see
that, because if there were an

470
00:30:40 --> 00:30:46
electric field -- if this is a
superconductor and there is an

471
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
electric field,
say, in this direction,

472
00:30:47 --> 00:30:53
there would be a potential
difference over the

473
00:30:50 --> 00:30:56
superconductor.
And Ohm's Law,

474
00:30:52 --> 00:30:58
V equals I R,
tells you then immediately that

475
00:30:55 --> 00:31:01
if this is not 0 but if this
is 0 that I would go to

476
00:30:59 --> 00:31:05
infinity.
So you cannot have any electric

477
00:31:04 --> 00:31:10
field in a superconductor.
If I approach a superconducting

478
00:31:09 --> 00:31:15
disk or material with a magnet
-- say this is the north pole

479
00:31:14 --> 00:31:20
and this is the south pole,
so we have an electric field

480
00:31:20 --> 00:31:26
configur- a magnetic field
configuration roughly like so.

481
00:31:25 --> 00:31:31
If I approach this
superconducting material,

482
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
then the EMF generated in here
because of Faraday's Law,

483
00:31:34 --> 00:31:40
because there's a change in the
magnetic flux coming off,

484
00:31:41 --> 00:31:47
that EMF must remain 0,
because you cannot have an

485
00:31:45 --> 00:31:51
electric field inside a
superconductor.

486
00:31:49 --> 00:31:55
And this, of course,
is I R.

487
00:31:52 --> 00:31:58
So R is also 0.
So I now can have any value,

488
00:31:56 --> 00:32:02
completely legitimate.
So you can have a huge current

489
00:32:01 --> 00:32:07
inside the superconductor,
but no EMF.

490
00:32:04 --> 00:32:10
And so as you approach with
this

491
00:32:09 --> 00:32:15
magnet, eddy currents are going
to run inside the superconductor

492
00:32:15 --> 00:32:21
in such a way that d phi/dt,
the flux change in here,

493
00:32:20 --> 00:32:26
is always 0.
And so these eddy currents will

494
00:32:24 --> 00:32:30
flow to never allow any magnetic
flux, because there was no

495
00:32:29 --> 00:32:35
magnetic flux to start with when
the magnet was high up,

496
00:32:35 --> 00:32:41
so there can never be any
change.

497
00:32:38 --> 00:32:44
And so the eddy c- currents
create a

498
00:32:42 --> 00:32:48
magnetic field themselves
which, if you vectorially add

499
00:32:46 --> 00:32:52
them to this magnetic field,
will always make sure that

500
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
there is no net magnetic field
inside the superconductor.

501
00:32:54 --> 00:33:00
And so if you now make a
drawing of the,

502
00:32:56 --> 00:33:02
of the two fields,
the one that is produced by the

503
00:33:00 --> 00:33:06
eddy currents and the one that
is produced by the magnet,

504
00:33:04 --> 00:33:10
when the magnet comes very
close -- so here is north and

505
00:33:08 --> 00:33:14
here is south,
and here is your superconductor

506
00:33:11 --> 00:33:17
--
then the superposition of those

507
00:33:14 --> 00:33:20
two fields then,
effectively comes down to the

508
00:33:18 --> 00:33:24
fact that this magnetic field
is completely repelled -- that's

509
00:33:23 --> 00:33:29
another way of looking at it.
You get a squeezed field here.

510
00:33:28 --> 00:33:34
But that is the superposition
of two magnetic fields,

511
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38
one produced by the eddy
currents and one from the,

512
00:33:36 --> 00:33:42
the magnet.
And whenever you have here such

513
00:33:39 --> 00:33:45
a squeezed magnetic field,
there is magnetic pressure.

514
00:33:44 --> 00:33:50
We know why there is magnetic
pressure, because north and

515
00:33:48 --> 00:33:54
north poles repel each other,
but we never expressed that in

516
00:33:53 --> 00:33:59
terms of a quantity.
And the magnetic pressure

517
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
equals B squared,
which is the magnetic field

518
00:33:59 --> 00:34:05
strength, divided by -- is it
2?

519
00:34:02 --> 00:34:08
Yeah, 2 mu 0,
divided by 2 mu 0.

520
00:34:05 --> 00:34:11
I'll get back to this a little
later in the lecture.

521
00:34:09 --> 00:34:15
And this is pressure,
so this is in newtons per

522
00:34:12 --> 00:34:18
square
meter.

523
00:34:14 --> 00:34:20
This is not entirely new,
this idea of pressure,

524
00:34:18 --> 00:34:24
because you may have seen at
people's desks, nice conversation

525
00:34:23 --> 00:34:29
piece.
You have here a,

526
00:34:25 --> 00:34:31
a magnet, and you have here a
magnet, and this is a,

527
00:34:29 --> 00:34:35
a wooden stick.
There's a hole in here and

528
00:34:32 --> 00:34:38
there's a hole in here.
This is north pole,

529
00:34:36 --> 00:34:42
south pole, north pole,
south pole, and they repel each

530
00:34:40 --> 00:34:46
other.
That's magnetic pressure.

531
00:34:42 --> 00:34:48
It's the same thing.
And if you drew the magnetic

532
00:34:48 --> 00:34:54
field configurations here,
go like this,

533
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
that's the magnetic field from
this magnet and this would be

534
00:34:57 --> 00:35:03
the magnetic field from that
magnet.

535
00:35:00 --> 00:35:06
We get the same idea.
You get magnetic pressure

536
00:35:04 --> 00:35:10
there.
If I rotate this magnet here,

537
00:35:07 --> 00:35:13
so th- first of all,
the magnet is repelled,

538
00:35:11 --> 00:35:17
which is in a way a form of
levitation, and we're

539
00:35:16 --> 00:35:22
going to show you that.
The magnet is just pushed up by

540
00:35:20 --> 00:35:26
the superconductor is the way
you can look at it.

541
00:35:23 --> 00:35:29
But if you start rotating it,
for instance,

542
00:35:26 --> 00:35:32
around with the south pole here
or the south pole there or the

543
00:35:30 --> 00:35:36
north pole there,
the eddy currents will

544
00:35:33 --> 00:35:39
instantaneously adjust to always
repel that magnet.

545
00:35:36 --> 00:35:42
So even if you rotate it,
it would still hang there,

546
00:35:40 --> 00:35:46
levitated, rotating.
What is not so easy to

547
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
understand is why the whole
thing

548
00:35:46 --> 00:35:52
is so very stable.
As you will shortly see,

549
00:35:51 --> 00:35:57
it's quite stable.
So I'm going to show you there

550
00:35:57 --> 00:36:03
this superconducting idea.
I first have to top it off with

551
00:36:03 --> 00:36:09
some liquid nitrogen,
so let me do that when we still

552
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
have full lights.
Oh boy.

553
00:36:12 --> 00:36:18
Good.
So I have to top it off.

554
00:36:16 --> 00:36:22
And this disk,
which is about an inch in

555
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
diameter, going to be
superconducting.

556
00:36:24 --> 00:36:30
I can even tell you what kind
of material it is.

557
00:36:27 --> 00:36:33
It is a copper oxide mixed with
yttrium and barium,

558
00:36:31 --> 00:36:37
and it becomes superconducting
at 90 degrees Kelvin.

559
00:36:35 --> 00:36:41
And liquid nitrogen is
77 degrees.

560
00:36:39 --> 00:36:45
So we're going to put a small
magnet on top,

561
00:36:42 --> 00:36:48
which we will levitate.
For that, we're going to have

562
00:36:46 --> 00:36:52
the following light situation.
And of course you want to see

563
00:36:52 --> 00:36:58
it also, don't you.
And you want some light.

564
00:36:55 --> 00:37:01
So there you see the disk,
which is -- should be

565
00:36:59 --> 00:37:05
superconducting now.
And here comes my little

566
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
magnet.
So there is no magnetic flux

567
00:37:05 --> 00:37:11
going through there.
It itself is not a magnet.

568
00:37:08 --> 00:37:14
But now I'm going to come close
with a magnet,

569
00:37:12 --> 00:37:18
and the eddy currents go nuts
in there, and it just floats on

570
00:37:17 --> 00:37:23
top.
It's amazing,

571
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24
isn't it.
So this is magnetic levitation,

572
00:37:22 --> 00:37:28
and you can rotate it around,
and the eddy currents adjust

573
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
instantaneously.
And there it is.

574
00:37:35 --> 00:37:41
Now, you've all seen it,
clear enough?

575
00:37:40 --> 00:37:46
OK, let me get the -- rescue my
magnet.

576
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
Imagine in the days of
Kamerlingh Onnes it took 4

577
00:37:52 --> 00:37:58
degrees Kelvin to
have anything superconductive,

578
00:38:00 --> 00:38:06
and now you can do it as easy
as that.

579
00:38:04 --> 00:38:10
There are other forms of
magnetic levitation.

580
00:38:09 --> 00:38:15
One going to be very promising
in our economy,

581
00:38:15 --> 00:38:21
we hope, and that is magnetic
levitation can be used for

582
00:38:21 --> 00:38:27
trains.
If you have a magnet and you

583
00:38:26 --> 00:38:32
move it
fast over a conducting surface,

584
00:38:30 --> 00:38:36
then you also get levitation.
You have to move it though,

585
00:38:35 --> 00:38:41
whereas there you don't have to
move it.

586
00:38:38 --> 00:38:44
See, if you let that magnet
just go, if you don't move it

587
00:38:43 --> 00:38:49
anymore, then there is an eddy
current going on,

588
00:38:47 --> 00:38:53
but the eddy current never
dissipates any heat.

589
00:38:50 --> 00:38:56
There is no I squared R because
R is 0.

590
00:38:54 --> 00:39:00
So you never lose the eddy
current.

591
00:38:57 --> 00:39:03
That's different with
what is coming now.

592
00:39:01 --> 00:39:07
Now I have a,
a magnet.

593
00:39:03 --> 00:39:09
Here is north and here is
south.

594
00:39:05 --> 00:39:11
So we have a magnetic field
sort of like this.

595
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
And I'm going to move it over a
plate, over a conducting plate,

596
00:39:13 --> 00:39:19
and I'll put the plate here.
And as it comes over this

597
00:39:18 --> 00:39:24
conducting plate,
the magnetic flux through that

598
00:39:21 --> 00:39:27
plate will change.
Mr.

599
00:39:23 --> 00:39:29
Faralow s- Mr.
Faraday says -- actually,

600
00:39:26 --> 00:39:32
it's Mr.
Lenz who says,

601
00:39:27 --> 00:39:33
"I don't
like that." And so they're

602
00:39:32 --> 00:39:38
going to run an eddy current in
here, and the eddy current will

603
00:39:36 --> 00:39:42
undoubtedly go in this direction
as it comes over here.

604
00:39:40 --> 00:39:46
And this current ring now will
produce a magnetic field in this

605
00:39:45 --> 00:39:51
direction.
And look what you have.

606
00:39:47 --> 00:39:53
You have again this is the
north pole of this eddy current

607
00:39:51 --> 00:39:57
and this is the south pole.
North pole repels north pole.

608
00:39:55 --> 00:40:01
And so if this has a high
enough speed so that the change

609
00:39:59 --> 00:40:05
of the
magnetic flux,

610
00:40:02 --> 00:40:08
the d phi/dt is high enough,
the train can float.

611
00:40:05 --> 00:40:11
Tens of tons of weight can be
made to float.

612
00:40:08 --> 00:40:14
And the reason why in this case
the train has to keep going,

613
00:40:12 --> 00:40:18
that if the train stops the
eddy current will die out.

614
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
There's no longer the d phi/dt
but there is resistance in this

615
00:40:20 --> 00:40:26
conductor, and so you get ohmic
dissipation.

616
00:40:23 --> 00:40:29
You get I squared R.
You get heat in here.

617
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
And so then the train will just
plunge down.

618
00:40:29 --> 00:40:35
And that's not the case with
the

619
00:40:32 --> 00:40:38
superconductor because you
don't dissipate any heat in the

620
00:40:36 --> 00:40:42
superconductor because the
superconductor has no

621
00:40:40 --> 00:40:46
resistance.
So the idea is the same,

622
00:40:42 --> 00:40:48
but you see now why you have to
keep this one going and why

623
00:40:47 --> 00:40:53
there you don't.
And so again you get a squeezed

624
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
magnetic field,
like you have there,

625
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59
and so you get magnetic
pressure.

626
00:40:55 --> 00:41:01
Japan and Germany are really
the leaders in the world in the

627
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
technology of,
uh, maglevs -- that's what

628
00:41:03 --> 00:41:09
these
trains are called.

629
00:41:06 --> 00:41:12
United States is trying to
catch up.

630
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
There's an enormous reduction
in friction if you can have a

631
00:41:13 --> 00:41:19
train that is not in contact
with the rails.

632
00:41:16 --> 00:41:22
In fact, speeds have been
recorded up to

633
00:41:19 --> 00:41:25
miles per hour.
Both Germany and Japan have

634
00:41:23 --> 00:41:29
test trains, prototypes,
in operation.

635
00:41:26 --> 00:41:32
United States has made a
commitment to build a maglev

636
00:41:29 --> 00:41:35
train to go from Washington,
DC, back and forth to

637
00:41:33 --> 00:41:39
Baltimore, should be ready in
the year 2007.

638
00:41:37 --> 00:41:43
The cost per mile at about

639
00:41:40 --> 00:41:46
thirty million dollars per mile.
Now that may strike as high,

640
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
but keep in mind that if you
build a four-way highway,

641
00:41:48 --> 00:41:54
that's also thirty million
dollars per mile.

642
00:41:51 --> 00:41:57
So it's no more expensive than
a four-way highway.

643
00:41:55 --> 00:42:01
And again, when you visit the
8.02 website,

644
00:41:59 --> 00:42:05
I made several links to maglev
sites.

645
00:42:01 --> 00:42:07
I advise you to take a look.
Now there is a third form of

646
00:42:07 --> 00:42:13
magnetic levitation whereby we
don't need any speed and we

647
00:42:12 --> 00:42:18
don't need any superconductors
but we use AC,

648
00:42:15 --> 00:42:21
we use alternating current.
And that's also easy to see

649
00:42:20 --> 00:42:26
now.
Here is such a coil,

650
00:42:22 --> 00:42:28
and we run AC through it.
So at one particular moment in

651
00:42:27 --> 00:42:33
time, let's say the magnetic
field is like so,

652
00:42:31 --> 00:42:37
and maybe is increasing.
And then of course the magnetic

653
00:42:36 --> 00:42:42
field turns around,
up, down, up,

654
00:42:40 --> 00:42:46
down, because it's AC.
Now I have here a conducting

655
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
plate, and I put this above this
plate.

656
00:42:46 --> 00:42:52
But now I have this continuous
magnetic field change,

657
00:42:50 --> 00:42:56
so I have a continuous change
of magnetic flux in that plate.

658
00:42:54 --> 00:43:00
So as this magnetic flux,
as the B field down is

659
00:42:58 --> 00:43:04
increasing, you're going to get
an eddy current running in this

660
00:43:02 --> 00:43:08
direction, which will create the
magnetic field in that

661
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
direction.
And you're back where you were.

662
00:43:10 --> 00:43:16
You again have north pole,
north pole, south pole,

663
00:43:14 --> 00:43:20
south pole.
So again, the eddy current in

664
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
the conducting plate is
responsible for a magnetic

665
00:43:19 --> 00:43:25
field, and the two repel each
other.

666
00:43:21 --> 00:43:27
So a little later in time,
the magnetic field strength

667
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
will decrease.
When that happens,

668
00:43:27 --> 00:43:33
the eddy current will reverse
direction, and the two will

669
00:43:31 --> 00:43:37
attract each other.
And so you will think now it

670
00:43:34 --> 00:43:40
seems quite reasonable that half
the time they will attract each

671
00:43:38 --> 00:43:44
other and the
other half of the time they

672
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
will repel each other.
That, however,

673
00:43:45 --> 00:43:51
is not the case.
There will be a net repelling

674
00:43:48 --> 00:43:54
force.
And why that is,

675
00:43:50 --> 00:43:56
I will explain to you during
the next lecture.

676
00:43:53 --> 00:43:59
But I want to demonstrate it
now.

677
00:43:56 --> 00:44:02
I have here such a coil,
about an area of about 1

678
00:44:00 --> 00:44:06
square foot.
I can simply run

679
00:44:03 --> 00:44:09
volts, 60 hertz AC.
I switch th- turn this on.

680
00:44:07 --> 00:44:13
This goes into 110 volt
outlet, and I increase the

681
00:44:11 --> 00:44:17
current.
It starts to float.

682
00:44:15 --> 00:44:21
No high-speed train,
nothing superconducting.

683
00:44:19 --> 00:44:25
What do you think will happen
when I turn it over?

684
00:44:23 --> 00:44:29
Excuse me?
Of course it will float again.

685
00:44:27 --> 00:44:33
The ed- the eddy currents
adjust themselves at any moment

686
00:44:31 --> 00:44:37
in time, and they will always
make it float.

687
00:44:35 --> 00:44:41
So this is another interesting
form of magnetic levitation.

688
00:44:40 --> 00:44:46
So we have the superconducting
way, whereby there is no

689
00:44:45 --> 00:44:51
dissipation in
the disk, so those currents

690
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
never die out.
Then you have the case of the

691
00:44:52 --> 00:44:58
train, if I call that the train,
the magnetic levitation,

692
00:44:56 --> 00:45:02
whereby you have to keep the
speed going, because if you

693
00:45:00 --> 00:45:06
don't have the speed then you
don't have enough magnetic flux

694
00:45:05 --> 00:45:11
changes in the surface,
and so you don't have the eddy

695
00:45:09 --> 00:45:15
currents.
The eddy currents would die,

696
00:45:11 --> 00:45:17
you get heat dissipation.
And then there is the third

697
00:45:15 --> 00:45:21
case
here, whereby you simply have a

698
00:45:19 --> 00:45:25
changing magnetic field in the
coil with AC,

699
00:45:23 --> 00:45:29
which then creates the changing
eddy currents.

700
00:45:27 --> 00:45:33
So now we come to the
levitation of a woman.

701
00:45:31 --> 00:45:37
How do we levitate a woman?
Well, the secret must be in

702
00:45:36 --> 00:45:42
that equation.
V is B squared divided by 2

703
00:45:39 --> 00:45:45
mu 0.
We have a coil which is about

704
00:45:43 --> 00:45:49
1 square foot,
so the area of that coil is

705
00:45:46 --> 00:45:52
about 0.1 square meters.

706
00:45:51 --> 00:45:57
And so our goal was that we
should be able to lift,

707
00:45:56 --> 00:46:02
let's say, a
pounder, to give ourselves a

708
00:46:01 --> 00:46:07
little bit of leeway.
And so we calculated that if

709
00:46:06 --> 00:46:12
the magnetic field,
B, is about 

710
00:46:10 --> 00:46:16
gauss, which is about 0.15 tesla,

711
00:46:14 --> 00:46:20
that we would get very close.
We know that mu 0 is 4 pi

712
00:46:22 --> 00:46:28
times 10 to the -7 in
SI units.

713
00:46:25 --> 00:46:31
And so you can calculate now
what the force is on this area.

714
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
The force is of course the
pressure times the area,

715
00:46:36 --> 00:46:42
assuming that the magnetic
field is uniform.

716
00:46:40 --> 00:46:46
And so you're going to get that
this force is going to be B

717
00:46:45 --> 00:46:51
squared, which is 0.15, squared,

718
00:46:50 --> 00:46:56
divide by 2,
divide by 4 pi,

719
00:46:54 --> 00:47:00
times 10 to the 7,
multiplied by the area,

720
00:46:59 --> 00:47:05
which is 0.1 square
meter, and you find that this is

721
00:47:05 --> 00:47:11
about 900 newtons.
90 kilograms,

722
00:47:10 --> 00:47:16
as I said, a
pounder.

723
00:47:13 --> 00:47:19
Then we tried to get this
magnetic field,

724
00:47:18 --> 00:47:24
and believe me,
Marcos and I and Bill,

725
00:47:22 --> 00:47:28
we really
tried, but there was a problem,

726
00:47:26 --> 00:47:32
because we needed enormously
high currents to get these

727
00:47:29 --> 00:47:35
magnetic fields.
And at these very high

728
00:47:32 --> 00:47:38
currents, our circuit breakers
would go every time.

729
00:47:35 --> 00:47:41
So we called up the physical
plant, and they said,

730
00:47:38 --> 00:47:44
"Yeah, what do you expect,
man?

731
00:47:40 --> 00:47:46
You need several hundred
amperes.

732
00:47:42 --> 00:47:48
You think we can get 700 -- several hundred

733
00:47:45 --> 00:47:51
amperes out of this system?
You have to redesign MIT for

734
00:47:48 --> 00:47:54
that." So it was very
disappointing for us.

735
00:47:51 --> 00:47:57
So the best we could do with the
strongest current that we could

736
00:47:56 --> 00:48:02
generate, we could only get a
magnetic field of about

737
00:48:00 --> 00:48:06
350 gauss,
which is four times lower.

738
00:48:04 --> 00:48:10
And the tragedy has it that the
magnetic pressure goes with B

739
00:48:08 --> 00:48:14
squared, so that makes it
16 times lower.

740
00:48:11 --> 00:48:17
So the 200 pounder now
becomes a 12 pounder.

741
00:48:15 --> 00:48:21
But that's the reason why when
some women wrote me very nice

742
00:48:20 --> 00:48:26
email yesterday because they
volunteered, why I had to say,

743
00:48:24 --> 00:48:30
"Thanks, but no
thanks." But I want to keep my

744
00:48:33 --> 00:48:39
promise.
I said I was going to levitate

745
00:48:42 --> 00:48:48
a woman, and I will.
And here she is.

746
00:48:50 --> 00:48:56
[laughter].
And as far as we know,

747
00:48:58 --> 00:49:04
it
is a woman.

748
00:49:02 --> 00:49:08
[laughter].
OK, give her some room.

749
00:49:09 --> 00:49:15
She deserves -- we ready for
that?

750
00:49:15 --> 00:49:21
And there she goes.
I levitated a woman.

751
00:49:23 --> 00:49:29
[laughter].
Have a great Spring

752
00:49:30 --> 00:49:36
Break. [applause].
